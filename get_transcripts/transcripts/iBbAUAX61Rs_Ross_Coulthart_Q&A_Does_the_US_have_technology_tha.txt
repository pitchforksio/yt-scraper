Good day and welcome to this week's
episode of Reality Check Q&A. That
opportunity in the week where you get
the chance to ask me the curly
questions. And to help me do that is
Megan Orda. Welcome Megan. Nice to see
you here. Ross, great to see you today.
Just like last week, I should actually
sort of say before we start that I have
been as sick as a dog, Megan. I've had
CO. So, if I'm a little slow off the
mark today, I plead I plead the excuse.
I've got a doctor's certificate to prove
it. I have been very ill. So, uh please
be kind to me. Yes. Well, Ross, we are
all glad that you're feeling better. Um
we will probably not take it easy on you
um like normal. Um, but we do need to
start this week just like last week with
breaking news. So, get this. Policy
director for the White House Office of
Science Technology. His name is Michael
Katzios. He said today about US
technology. I'm going to quote him here.
Our technologies permit us to manipulate
time and space. They leave distance
annihilated. Let's listen into a bit of
his sound. Our technologies permit us to
manipulate time and space. They leave
distance annihilated, cause things to
grow and improve productivity. Okay,
Megan. Well, I would love to think that
Michael Katzios, the White House science
and technology advisor, a former under
secretary of defense, a former chief
technology officer for the United
States. I would love to be able to say
with absolute bold assertion that he's
talking there about retrieved alien
technology and he's about to blow all in
a big disclosure moment. But wiser heads
are suggesting to me that one should
view his comments metaphorically that
essentially he's firstly not a trained
engineer or scientist. He's somebody who
comes from a policy background. uh he is
the former US chief technology officer
from two 2019 to 2021.
uh he's also briefly acted as the under
secretary of defense for re research and
engineering from 2020 to 2021 and he was
also intriguingly chief of staff to
Peter Teal at Palanteer and he's had a
huge role in AI but a lot of people are
emphasizing to me that his speech was
essentially and I think it was a great
speech his speech was talking about how
weird it is that the US has really not
made any significant technological
advances equivalent to what we'd made up
to that period in the ' 50s60s and
70s in the same way in the past 50 years
and he talks I think it's worth
including some of his earlier comments a
gap exists lies between our moment and
the speed of transformation America
experienced midentury progress has
slowed yes large language models
astonishes rockets still turn our eyes
upwards and satellites envelop the
globe. But as we look forward to
America's 250th birthday celebration
next year, our progress today pales in
comparison to the huge leaps of the 20th
century. Consider the country of 50
years ago. And he's right. And you know,
the interesting thing is people inside
the legacy program, they tell me that
this is why they're frustrated. They say
that this is why they want the United
States government to tell the truth
about the advanced technology that it
has because they believe that there have
been advances made. But if you look at
even science and technology developments
in aviation and space tech, we're still
using space rockets that were
essentially designed by the Nazis in the
1940s. I mean really we haven't come
very far at all on the official public
record and so I guess I do think in all
likelihood Michael Katzios was speaking
metaphorically and even if he was
alluding in some way to some secret
program that he's been briefed into he's
obviously got the out he can say look I
was speaking metaphorically I was
speaking about even when I'm talking
about the ability to manipulate space
and time. Maybe he's talking about the
extraordinary developments in
hypersonics technology or quantum AI. I
mean, there's any number of reasons that
he could give to metaphorically explain
what he was saying. So, I think we've
killed that one for the moment at least,
Megan. But believe me, everyone, I am
chasing Michael Katsios for the
opportunity to do an interview with him
because I do think he would be a very
good interview.
Ross, we definitely agree. U we will go
to the next question. Speaking of
technology, we've got James Kirk. Dear
Mr. Colart, I applaud your statement
that there may be many alien
civilizations visiting our planet. Do
you think a technology can be developed
to mimic the human brain to summon
certain types of UAPs or UFOs? And could
this technology be quantbased?
So, do I think a technology exists or do
do I think a technology could be created
that could mimic the human brain to
summon UAPs? Is that the basic question?
Correct. Well, I I think the point of
Skywatcher is that there's already a
technology they claim that exists that
can do that and that's psionic
technology. So, we don't need to develop
a technology. It already exists. James
T. Kirk. Um I think um uh I've seen
psionic technology developed uh shown
and demonstrated and I I think it's
real. Um I I uh I I can't explain it. I
don't know how it works. There's also
the dog whistle which is the um electro
mechanical signaling device. And
obviously Skywatch is being slightly koi
and revealing the full extent of what it
knows about the dog whistle. I can't
blame them because frankly, let's point
this out to people. If it is the case
that this device can summon
UAPs, you really don't want to summon a
UAP unless you know what you're doing.
Um, so yeah, I mean, I don't think we
need to replicate the human brain in
order to be able to do this. I think the
human brain's already capable of doing
it.
Okay, Ros, I'm going to skip ahead to a
couple questions to kind of play off
what you just said. This is from at the
GFN PC. Do you think it's safe that we
summon them? What exactly is the message
the NIH are receiving during the dog
whistle? What if they get upset that
they keep getting called?
Those are all incredibly good questions.
And uh if people watch my interview with
Jake Barber and Matthew Pines that we
did about two weeks ago on reality
check, we actually went into a lot of
this where you know we explored with
Jake what they do. And ultimately one of
the things that I think Jake explained
which I'd love to hear more about by the
way is that they have an oath that
everybody swears on the area on the
range before they actually do the
summoning. They've also vowed at
SkyWatcher not to act offensively
against NHI, which I think is absolutely
crucial. That's a distinction from what
I understand the United States
government has been doing in collusion
with private aerospace. As shocking as
it may sound, the United States has
secretly, the military has secretly been
using high pulse microwave weapons to
down UAP craft that it has been
summoning using both psionics and the
electromechanical dog whistle. I I
really think that's outrageous. Wouldn't
it be terrible if our first engagement
with a nonhuman intelligence was that
humans acted offensively against a
highly advanced intelligence? And what
does it say about the benevolence of
that intelligence that even though it's
had that done to it, it hasn't wiped us
out?
Absolutely. Let's go to our next
question. This is from uh email.
Kimberly Mackey sent this in. Hi Ross. I
would love to hear your thoughts on why
private citizens with funding for places
like Skywatcher and Skinwatcher Ranch
have such great success yet taxpayer
funded places like NASA and other groups
which receive grants to research space
are not achieving the same success.
Could they be keeping the public in the
dark for more funding? Or could it be
that these phenomenon are not from space
but from here within Earth?
Okay, there's two kind of questions in
there. Firstly, I'll deal with the
latter one first. I think there is a
very high likelihood that part of the
phenomenon that we're talking about is
intraterrestrial, that it's from this
planet, perhaps in another dimension in
this planet or perhaps deep underwater
on this planet and out of sight of
humanity. Uh, but I think there is a
possibility that at least some of what
explains the phenomenon is here with us
in some way. Uh, what was the first part
of the question? Forgive me, I'm still a
bit dirty.
Absolutely. Why do places like
Skywatcher and Skinwatcher Ranch who
have private citizens with private
funding, why are they having so much
success when places like NASA that are
that are funded by taxpayers, they're
not really seeing as much success? Okay,
I think NASA knows a hell of a lot more
about the phenomenon than it prefers to
let on. Now, it's very complicated this
because I am not saying that the senior
leadership at NASA knows everything.
I've been in the weird situation where
without naming him I've been able to
speak to an extremely senior person who
served in a very senior p role at NASA
and they have assured me convincingly
that they were not read in to any legacy
UAP retrieval and reverse engineering
program. But I'm aware from my own
sources. I even know the name of the
person in NASA. And I've passed that
name on to the person who I was talking
to who is allegedly the gatekeeper
inside NASA who controls all legacy
program issues inside NASA. The program
is very clever. They don't use
necessarily the top people to run their
operation. They do keep a very close eye
on nominally civilian governmental
organizations like NASA to make sure
they don't stumble across something that
might blow their cover. And so they have
people inserted like moles if you like
to keep an eye on what's going on. And I
am persuaded that yes, NASA has been
sanitizing photographs and video to
disguise in some cases things that have
been recorded. I take particularly close
interest, for example, as some of the
space shuttle missions, notably
STS48 that I'm doing an awful lot of
work on at the moment. For those who
don't know
STS48, go to YouTube, put that in and
have a look at it. It
shows an
object clearly appearing to avoid a
flash of light from the planet and then
zooming off into outer space after the
flash of light. Now, certain NASA
debunker skeptics, self-styled NASA
spokespeople who aren't really, have
asserted that those are space debris of
some kind, perhaps ice particles from
the thrusters on the shuttle. That does
not bear out. And uh I've had good cause
from recent sources that have got in
touch with me to develop the view that
there has been obscuring of photographs
and videos inside NASA. But to suggest
that this has been coordinated at a very
high level inside NASA is another thing
entirely. The legacy program is much
much cleverer than that. And I do
believe that there are individuals in
NASA who are aware of retrieved
non-human technology. And indeed, I've
spoken to some of them who are willing
to tell me off the record that they do
believe there is a cover up. But I think
the issue with NASA is quite complicated
because I think it's a well-meaning
institution that has been egregiously
misled. All right, Ross, we will go to
the next question. And this is from
Carol Long. I know you love this topic.
What happened to the drone sightings in
the USA and other parts of the world.
The news on these seems to have stopped
suddenly.
Okay. Well, if you believe the official
narrative, the official narrative is
that the drones all went away and that
we were all deluding ourselves in a
hyperbolic misunderstanding and that
these were largely
um normal flights flying in and around
New Jersey and that people were
misidentifying normal regular aircraft
and drones for objects that were
anomalous. Now, our NewsNation
correspondent Rich McHugh, and you might
want to use a segment from what Rich
showed us, he was out at sea with uh I
think a section of the US uh Coast
Guard. Actually, no, he wasn't out at
sea. He was on the beach after they got
back in from being on the ocean. and he
recorded an extraordinary interview,
Megan, with people who had been out on
the ocean and seen anomalous objects,
injubitably anomalous objects. Moreover,
I know because I spoke to them at the
time that they were doing it that the
Skywatcher team, including Jake Barber,
were deployed over the Pikatini Arsenal
in New Jersey in December. And it's
interesting because Jake Barber has now
confirmed on the record what he'd
confirmed to me off the record, which is
that they did see anomalous objects over
the Pikatini Arsenal, which is one of
the most sensitive weapons installations
in that part of the United States. It's
located in northern New Jersey. So, I've
actually promised some Irish friends of
mine that I would use the word bollocks.
bollocks. And I'm going to say bollocks
to the whole claim that these drones can
be prosaically explained. It's a cover
up. Somebody in the US government is
lying. And frankly, there's not a lot we
can do about it because the White House
position of course is that these are FAA
authorized drones. And that frankly does
not survive scrutiny. It's complete
bollocks. There is no basis at all to
the suggestion that the FAA authorized
these these supposed incursions by
authorized research drones. They've
never provided any evidence to
substantiate that there were authorized
research flights. And I suspect that the
recent announcement that the FAA would
be conducting research drone flights
over New Jersey is an expost facto
attempt to justify the line
that they've perpetuated for the last
few months. I can tell you that the
people of New Jersey and their political
representatives aren't buying it. I've
also spoken more recently to certain
people in the police force there who
tell me they're not buying it either.
They know what they saw.
Okay, Rosson, I will make sure to add in
Rich Mchuan NewsNation's video that you
were referring to and I can link to some
of those um episodes that we did below
for people as well if they want to check
them out. Um we will move on to
newbotany. Back in the 40s until
recently, most of the UAP scene could be
described as flying saucers. Now we have
all kinds of peculiar devices that have
been documented by SkyWatcher, none of
which are consistent with the original
saucer description. Why is that? I don't
think Skywatch is in a position yet to
be able to definitively say that it has
identified flying sources, but I'll bet
that eventually that that comes into the
classes of objects that they say that
they see. One of the issue with what
we've called flying sauces in the past
is if you're looking at a lenticular
object at a distance, what does it look
like? It looks like a
cigar. So unless you've seen that object
on in profile on its side or moving in
the air in a way that allows you to see
its full three-dimensional shape, I
think there's a possibility that what
the what the eye perceives is different
from what the object is shaped like. I'm
certainly getting a lot of people who
are telling me that they're seeing
anomalous objects that confirm conform
to a a flying saucer shape. And I'd also
point people's attention to the fact
that one of the objects that the
Skywatcher team say they're seeing is
the manta, the manta ray. So, uh that
that is essentially a a lenticular
uh slightly triangular shaped object
that slightly saucer-like. I mean, we
just don't know what these objects are.
We don't know how the technology works.
Maybe they have the capacity to morph
themselves in some way depending on
where they are in what kind of
atmosphere. I have no idea. There's
certainly been, I think, an abundance of
reports over the years going back
decades to suggest that whatever these
UAP are, they're capable of changing
themselves in some way. So, no, I'm not
ruling out the possibility that um
flying sauces will conventually conform
to the conventional idea of a flying
saucer shape. We just don't know yet
enough to know one way or the other.
Okay, thank you Ross. We have time for
one more. This is going to come from at
Uptown Saturday. Ross and Megan.
Renowned remote viewer Pat Price claimed
a vast underground extraterrestrial base
exists beneath Mount Zeal in Australia's
Northern Territory near Alice Springs.
Given your somewhat relative proximity,
what details can you provide about this
intriguing assertion? I've been asked
about this one before and it's a great
question and look, I've found the CIA
records that refer to this. So, it is
true. during a CIA sponsored Stargate
program investigation using remote
viewing. Uh, which of course the
Pentagon denies the efficacy of. So why
on earth did they spend millions of
dollars doing the program? There's a
certain idiocy to the claims that
there's no basis to this psionic
attitude because frankly they wouldn't
have spent the money unless they knew it
worked. Um, there was a remote view and
in fact it's not just one remote viewer
that's done this. I was reading um uh
just a few days ago about a Lynn
Buchanan who's done similar work as a
remote viewer and the claim is that
there is some kind of alien base under a
place called Mount Zeal which as it
happens is very close to Australia and
America's most sensitive base outside
the continental United States, Pine Gap,
the so-called joint facility. If you
were an alien species and you wanted to
see what the US is really up to, you
would go to a very, very remote corner
of the Australian outback, slap bang in
the middle of central Australia near
Uluru, otherwise known previously as I
rock. And on the McDonald Rangers, there
is this weird place called Pine Gap,
where the US has what is essentially a
downlink for satellite feeds from orbit,
which we know has been used to monitor
for intercontinental ballistic missile
launches, but I suspect also has other
purposes. One of the most secret bases
in the world. As for the claim of an
alien base, which is about 16 kilometers
further to the northwest, I understand.
Um, impossible to prove because uh I've
been to Mount Zeal. I've walked around
Mount Zeal and just for my own fun when
I was there, I had a damn good look and
there ain't nothing there. There's lots
of lizards, lots of deadly deadly snakes
and spiders, lots of what we call scrub
in Australia, small little bushes that
are struggling to live against the
incredibly hot sun. But um frankly, I
didn't see any aliens.
Well, that's unfortunate, Ross, but if
anyone was going to find him, it was
going to be you. So, thank you for
trying. No problem at all. Uh those are
all the hard ball questions I have for
you today, Ross. I just want to remind
people that you can email your questions
to us reality check@newsnationow.com
and hopefully Thank you very much Megan.
Hopefully I'll be able to answer your
questions with more lucidity next week.
I am still struggling. I hope none of
you get this co. It has really knocked
me for six. Take echanatia and a good
rum totty. Yeah, emphasis on the rum
totty. Thanks Rob. See you.
