Good day and welcome back to Reality
Check. I'm your host, Ross Kulart, and
this week I'm very excited because we're
telling the story of one of my favorite
UFO UAP sightings of all time. And who
better to help us tell that story than a
former British police detective, Gary
Hesseline, the founder and editor of the
UK UFO Truth magazine. Gary's spent many
years investigating what I suspect is
one of the most important UAP sightings
ever. It's the Rendlesham Forest
incident of December 1980. a sighting
of, shall we say, a possible nonhuman
craft in a forest close to the twin
bases of RAF Bentwaters and RAF
Woodbridge on the East Anglian coast in
the county of Suffk, England. It's a
case known as Britain's Roswell. It's a
site with an intriguing history. A near
nearby location called Orford Ness is
where radar was first developed and
early atomic weapons development began
there in the 50s. And then in the 70s,
the same site was used for a top secret
experimental over the horizon radar
system delightfully named Cobra Mist.
This is an area stooped in military
secrets. And who better to tell us all
about it than Gary Histlein. Good day,
Gary. Uh, it's a delight to be on your
show. Thank you for inviting me. Now,
Gary, you're the uh author of a new book
on this subject. Tell us all about your
book. When did that come out and where
can people get hold of it? Well, the
book was self-published and there is a
story behind that which we'll go into,
no doubt. Uh, it was published in uh on
Amazon. self-published on Amazon in and
released in February of 2023. Um, and
the title uh, nonhuman and by magic
there's the book uh, non-human the
Reynolds forest UFO incident i.e. plural
uh, 42 years of denial. Um, we can talk
about why I chose that title if you
wished. So Gary, a lot of people may
think they know the Rendlessham Forest
story. You know, everybody's heard the
audio of Colonel Charles Halt, the
deputy base commander, who went out into
the forest on what I think was the
second of three interesting nights that
took place at that time. And it's quite
chilling audio of the colonel describing
what he and a host of British and
American people saw that night. But what
I'm really interested to start you off
with
is what do people not understand about
the Rendlessham story? What have we not
yet understood that you think is the
primary revelation from this
extraordinary
encounter? I researched the story a long
time ago and thought I knew it. But when
I was asked to get involved in a
documentary as a lead researcher, I
thought, well, if I'm going to put my
name to it, it best be accurate. So, I
decided to do a a reinvestigation
uh of everything about the case from
literally days afterwards. Uh, and that
process actually took me on a journey
that took five years. And
then I realized I had so much material
both old and new that had never seen the
light of day anywhere that I thought the
public would need to see that uh I
decided to write a book and the book
took three years. Um the first thing
that you really have to understand with
Reynolds is I I think it's arguably the
most complicated UFO story in history.
And that's because it's has many
different layers. agend there's
different agendas by governments.
There's media uh downplaying it. There's
multiple agendas possibly at play with
some of the military witnesses. It's an
evolving story. And it's an evolving
story because at the end of my uh book,
I I detailed
17 different timed UFO events. 17
different time events. not over two or
three days as we originally thought, but
stretching now to about a week period
because during the course of the the of
that reinvestigation, I came across a
witness who actually uh talked about an
incident on the 23rd of December, which
of course nobody had ever heard of at
that point. Okay. So, what what is the
thing that people don't know about
Rendlessham that you think they should
know? What's the thing that leaps out to
you most about the case? that there's
far more witnesses who've never seen the
light of day in front of a camera uh
being interviewed. Uh I think the
biggest story is that the narrative of
the case has been controlled uh pretty
pretty well for probably the last 25
years at least.
So, for the benefit of our audience that
don't know the Rendlessham story, and
you and I are total addicts, I've spent
time trotting around that forest in
Suffuk and had a ball trying to figure
out who saw what and when. Um, let's
just go through the basics of what we
understand happened in that December
period in 1980. Well, the original story
I should say really up to 2017 before
the reinvestigation was that there had
been the incident occurred in late
December 1980 and it basically involves
US Air Force security police uh at a
twin base complex like you said RAF
Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge in Suffukk
uh which is about 80 90 miles uh north
of London. Uh what made it interesting
in terms of becoming a worldwide famous
case is when this memorandum was
released in a big newspaper headline in
October of 1983 nearly three years after
the actual events and it and the title
was pretty impressive. UFO lands in
Suffukk and it's official. And it's
official. That's a great news of the
world headline. Oh, absolutely. And but
what made it official is that they got a
hold of this what now turns out to be
this very famous US air force document
called the halt memorandum uh which was
this one-page memo that Colonel Halt
then a left tenant colonel the deputy
base commander of what was a nuclear
base we talk about that in in in no
doubt uh he wrote a memo about two weeks
after the events to the ministry of
defense because he was told to by the
base commander the Colonel Williams. Uh
Holt did not want to write the letter.
He really wanted to just keep out of it
even though he'd got caught up in the
event, but he was told, "No, you need to
let the British know." Because
essentially what the Americans were
saying was that this this had all
happened on British soil. It weren't on
the bases. It was on British soil. And
what you have to understand is if you've
got uh Bentwaters there and uh
Woodbridge there in that middle you can
basically say there was the forest
Reynolds from Forest. So it it had
effectively happened on British soil and
as a courtesy the story was write a memo
let them know. Halt writes a one-page
teaser. It really was a teaser and he
played it down. unexpected lights, you
know. Uh he didn't call it UFO, but what
the document uh did that was amazing
really is one it was on a US Air Force
heading paper. So when it came out, they
couldn't say that it wasn't anything to
do with the Air Force that they didn't
know about it. Uh but the three
paragraphs are pretty amazing because
the first paragraph says that
effectively on what was then deemed the
first night, two airmen had got very
close to what would appear to be a
mechanical object that had landed or at
or near the ground hovering on the
ground uh in a in a small clearing in
the forest. Now this is a triangular
object approximately 3 m by 3 m in
dimensions with 2 m height. And
basically one of the uh the key witness
to that description was Sergeant Jim
Penniston who was very well thought of
by his colleagues. Uh he said he walked
around it, touched it, didn't have a
clue, said it was warm to the touch. It
was like glass. It was effectively black
in color with some self- femininating
lights that would kind of just drift
through from within. Uh he said at one
point uh he found raised etchings like
the etchings on your windscreen. And he
then he said he came across some
symbols. He said he took photographs uh
which he later claimed he was told that
they'd come out fogged for whatever
reason. Maybe that's true. Maybe that's
a cover up. But he said he took
photographs. He walked around it,
touched it. he wrote it in his
pocketbook. Uh so that was essentially
one thing in that first paragraph. The
second paragraph was it then went into
the dimensions of that
investigation including the fact that uh
depressions were found in the ground. Uh
which effectively gave it like a tripod
appendage, a landing gear. And they were
all pressed to the same size and weight
of depression, which some people have
estimated to be just over a ton, but
that's pure speculation. But there were
three grounding depressions. And what
that basically said is that there was
some physical evidence there to
corroborate the fact that they'd seen
this object at or near the ground. Then
the last paragraph, which for me has
always been the most important because
Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt, Deputy
base commander of a nuclear base,
actually said he went out in the forest
with his own team and whilst in the
forest, they saw multiple UFOs himself
and then he signed it. Now, we don't
have many documents in UFO archives that
are signed by such a high ranking person
to having seen multiple UFOs. So for me
that's what elevates it to an special
document. So that was a major
revelation.
So Colonel Charles Halt, Lieutenant
Colonel Charles Halt, who you mentioned,
he was the deputy base commander. Is
there any doubt in your mind that there
were nuclear weapons on those bases? No.
During the course of my research, I
spoke to six military personnel, many of
whom had never been on the record in
terms of documentaries and being
interviewed, and they said they were
guarding tactical nuclear weapons, which
is low yield. Now, the interest I had in
the case right from the first hearing
about it was the fact that I'd served
six years in the Royal Air Force Police
and for three of my six years I'd done
exactly the same job as them as guarding
nuclear weapons at RAF Huntington in
Suffukk and RAF Larbrook in what was
then West Germany. So, I kind of
suspected there were a lot more
witnesses.
Had you seen any anomalous phenomena
over nuclear weapons or during your time
in service? No, amazingly I didn't. Uh,
in fact, having had a childhood sighting
at the age of 16, I kind of put that to
bed for a long time, just kind of
watched it if anything, got books on it.
But after a few years, I really didn't
do anything. And I don't recall anything
during the Air Force at all. Uh, my six
years. So, I had the privilege of
meeting and interviewing Charles Halt
quite a few years ago, back to about 10
years ago. Good interview. And he
described what he saw moving through the
trees in the forest with the team that
he was with. He described it as a big
red eye uh that was moving between the
trees in the forest. And a lot of the
skeptics, the debunkers immediately
leapt on the Orford Ness lighthouse. And
that's always been used, if you like, as
the kind of default debunk for the whole
story, that all of these people were
just freaking out because they saw a
light in the forest and what they didn't
realize was that it was the light of the
lighthouse. Let's deal with that debunk
explanation straight away. Gary, what do
you say to that?
Uh, as you would often say on your show,
 Absolute Um, it was
ludicrous from the beginning. Uh, I I
met Halt. I had a seven-year
collaboration period with him. A and I
actually met him on a couple of
occasions. I walked through the forest
with him asking him to show me go over
the to see if we could get any new
information based on his tape recording.
And uh he told me an absolute thing
that's perfect one that he used to take
people to offer Nest Lighthouse himself
when he had visitors to the base because
it was a nice pretty area and there were
nice British pubs that you could take
Americans to etc. So, as they do, uh,
but the other thing that was most
important is that when we were in the
forest filming, uh, for a documentary
that actually never aired, uh, he'd come
over, they brought him across and we had
some free time and, uh, I said, "Can you
do retrace your steps based on your
audio?" Because I suspected nobody had
ever done it. And we went around and at
one point we're opposite what's called
the farmhouse and the farmer's field.
And the significance of that field which
is at the edge of the forest which is
effectively surrounded by the forest but
you come to a big what was then a plowed
field and this is this is
2010 and we we stood uh by the edge of
the field and he said look this is where
I first saw the object in the clear i.e
not in amongst the trees. And so it had
been they followed it through the trees,
described it as a red glowing object,
maybe the size of a car with a black
center like an eye that seemed to be
winking at you and it appeared to be
dripping molten metal. Well, they
followed it through the forest
underneath, and this is what a lot of
people don't realize, underneath the
canopy of the trees. The trees at the
time were Corsican pines. Now, Corsican
pines are not there now because in 1987
there was a huge storm and 90% of the
original trees were knocked over. So,
they were replanted. Not Corsican pine.
Now, the Corsican pine plays a vital
part in the story because their leaves
as it were and their branches don't
begin till about 15 20 feet off the
ground which is pretty substantial. So,
if you've ever and you've been there,
you will see that you have these rows of
trees with big gaps between them. Well,
imagine you've seen the new trees, the
replanted trees, which are much smaller,
and they're not the same tree, so
they're branches much lower down.
Imagine back in 1980, you've got a 20
foot before you get to a branch. So,
anything seen underneath was very easy
to pick up. So, they followed it through
the trees until it got to the edge of
the farmer's field.
Let's cut to the quick on this, Gary. Do
you think that what was seen in the
forest that night and previous and other
nights was a nonhuman technology of some
kind? Absolutely. Yeah, it was it was
anomalous. There were multiple events.
And that's I guess when I did the cold
case review as a former detective, I I
basically thought, well, I'll take
sentiment out of this. I will stick to
the facts and look for reason
determinations. Now, with the new
witnesses that emerged through my
inquiry, uh, ended up with 17 different
timed events. Well, some of these, well,
all of these were anomalous and we, you
know, we can go through many of them.
Okay. There's one thing I want to ask
you though.
Do you think Charles Halt, the
lieutenant colonel, left tenant colonel
in in charge of deputy base commander,
do you think he's told the whole story
of what he actually saw in the forest?
Absolutely not. Absolutely not. There
are claims in your book that suggest
that witnesses recorded Halt actually
being in the presence of the craft.
That's not quite right. Let me just
clarify. Hol denied as soon as he
retired, he denied that there was any
talk of suggestion of aliens, life
forms, or anything being seen in the
forest. And that was because he was
essentially debunking as soon as he
retired, I think 1991, as soon as he
retired, he basically began to attack
the original military whistleblower who
was called uh Larry Warren, a
controversial figure, but only over time
because the others attacked him. But at
the time, he was the first one to say,
"My name is go on camera and I was a
witness to this." Now, his story didn't
match the story of Jim Penniston and
John Burrows, and it didn't match
Colonel Holtz. So, when Hol retired, he
basically started saying, "No, the guy
wasn't there. He was kicked out of the
Air Force, blah, blah, blah." And
essentially, I was looking for
corroboration, and I eventually found it
with a a very uh arguably the best
linking witness to all of this, to the
real story, was a guy called Sergeant
Adrien Bastenza. And it took me two
years to finally get him to agree
because he'd been very traumatized. What
did he say he saw? Cuz I'm very
interested. I'm very interested in what
Bastenza says he saw Charles Halt
witness. Well, he said that Charles Halt
and the base commander, Colonel Gordon
Williams, the guy in charge of the Twin
Bases, were present in the field in that
farmer's field that I described earlier.
uh to a second landing which was the one
that Larry Warren had said he'd been
involved in. And basically, was that on
the same was that on the same night that
Halt went on his patrol into the forest
with his team? According to Sergeant
Adrien Bastenza, no, but that was an
amazing admission that he made because
there I'm interviewing him for 4 and a
half hours in a transatlantic call. He'd
finally got into the zone as it were and
he was he'd been very reluctant in the
past to talk about things. He'd not
really done interviews. because he'd
made the odd statement on social media,
but we had this 4 and a half hours and
eventually he corroborates that there
was a uh a craft in the field that it
was surrounded by security police
personnel, US Air Force security police
personnel, that Larry Warren, the guy
who' come up with the original story of
that second landing, was there next to
him, actually closer to the craft than
he was, that it was being filmed not
just with cameras, still cameras, but it
was being filmed on early video and it
did exist in 1980 and cineifilm which
kind of a bit bizarre because it infers
that they knew it was coming back but
this is I think it's still a developing
story but he eventually said to me it's
on another night and I went what he said
it's not the same night as Hull okay
this is one thing I've got trouble with
because I've read the account of is it
Bastenza in your book and I I I like you
I find him quite a credible and strong
witness. He's very impressive. Yeah.
Yeah. But what it suggests is that
Charles Halt has lied. Not to put too
fine a point on it. And I've always
admired Charles Halt for having the
courage to come out and verify not only
that he wrote the memo and that he saw
what he saw, um, but that he feels very
strongly that what he saw that night was
extraterrestrial.
Why would if it's true what Bustinza
says and Charles Halt and is it Gordon
Williams the commander of the B were in
the field if it's true they were there
when this craft landed on a subsequent
occasion why would Charles Halt not
reveal that incident that that's to me I
think one of the most interesting
aspects in your non-human book well I
think well let's imagine it this way had
the story of broken that he said that
there was a second London that it was
being filmed, that the base commander
was there in charge of 12, thou,000
personnel and was there and there was
this and it was filmed, then you could
have had almost a disclosure moment
then. So the real reason I think that it
was all covered up, anything to do with
aliens was to deflect how good a case it
was to downplay the significance and the
story. Why why talk about it at all
though? I mean, why did Hulk file that
memo at the insistence of his base
commander? Why did he file that memo
that eventually found its way to the
British Department of Defense? Why not
just cover it up?
They have covered up a lot of things,
but he is he was the story goes
according to Halt that he was told to
write it by Colonel Williams after he sh
uh uh played in back the tape recorder
of of of his night in the forest. And he
said, "Well, it's happened on British
soil. They didn't want to get involved.
uh one, can we borrow the tape and I'll
take it to a meeting uh the next
general's meeting. Uh and then basically
uh write a memo. It's on British. So we
kind of want to wash our hands of it.
And I think everything that's come out
is a cover up because you talked about
the lighthouse. It was ludicrous. You've
got 17 different incidents. It's
ludicrous for every single one. Some
were even in the opposite directions. Do
you know what really gets my goat is at
the time that I did that Rendlessham
story, I really didn't understand enough
of the position of the lighthouse, which
is on a completely different bearing
from where Holt says he was looking. And
I was snowed. I came away initially
thinking, gee, there must just be a
bunch of hysterical security police
thinking that they've seen a UFO, but
really all they did was see a lighthouse
light through the through the trees. It
kind of sounded plausible to me, but
it's not until, as you've done, you do
the homework, you go there, you look at
and re retrace the steps and figure out
what people say they saw, and you
realize it's a load of hogwash. And and
that's the thing that really leapt out
at me about this case is that there has
been disinformation on an extraordinary
scale. Yes. the the lighthouse theory
was made up entirely by the BBC as a
response. An astronomer uh uh uh Ian
Ridpath uh did this famous video where
he's there at night with a BBC film crew
and they're saying, "Oh, look, it's the
lighthouse in the distance. Oh, look,
every 5 secondsoop." And you'd see a
flash. But the reality is if they' have
played that for a full minute, it
wouldn't have matched the audio. But he
chose literally a 10-second piece out of
Hol's audio and then matched it and
said, "Look, there it goes." They
obviously saw the White House. It was
made up by the media who I think at the
very highest levels, probably on a D
notice, were told, "You must play this
incident down." Okay. So, let's get into
the nitty-gritty of witnesses. Yeah.
I've always, I have to admit, assumed
the slurs on Larry Warren were true. I'd
always thought Everybody did. Yeah. I'd
always thought Larry Warren was
self-promoting and that it wasn't true
what he said cuz it didn't fit with what
Jim Penniston and Charles Halt said or
John Burrows. Let's go through what
Larry Warren says he saw and when he was
on the first night, wasn't he? No. No.
Absolutely. I thought he was on the 26th
to the 27th.
Right. There's a real misnomer about the
dates. Uh and it's probably never going
to be established now. Simply too much
time has gone along, but what you're
after is is trying to piece the the
story together as best you can. Now, we
do have some dates, but if you think
about the Halt memorandum, he changed
the dates later on when it would came
out and said, "No, it was actually a day
earlier. Each incident was a day
earlier, but I'm pretty certain that the
original dates were probably true, and
there's been a bit of shenanigans there
to play it down. Okay. So, what was what
was the first date? The first date until
the re uh reinvestigation was
essentially the night of the 25th into
the 26th. So, Christmas night into
Boxing Night. That's the first night
landing as it were with Sergeant Jim
Penniston and Airman John Burroughs.
Okay. Talk me through what happened.
Well, effectively uh a patrol uh with
Sergeant Stefins and Airman John
Burroughs were doing a rout routine
drive along the country road public road
on the way to the back gate of RAF
Woodbridge. Uh as they were just about
to turn towards RAF Woodbridge and
there's that long road up to the what
was classed as the east gate and and
obviously you've been there so you're
aware of that. They saw some lights in
the forest to their left. So they they
stop there. This is not from the east
gate like everybody thinks. They stop
there. They go into the forest for a
little walk and they see lights in the
distance underneath the canopy and
they're a bit concerned. Is it an
aircraft crashing or some incident? So
they then drive up to the gate, go
through the gate, use the telephone
there to ring it into the central
security control. They then request
another mobile to go there, which is
Sergeant Jim Penniston and his driver,
airman Ed Cabanza. So they all meet up,
the four of them at the east gate and
which is about 300 meters from the edge
of the forest as you look from the east
gate now. and they saw lights moving
around just above the treetops. Red,
yellow, white lights moving around.
Sergeant Jim Penniston then said, "Look,
I want permission to go out." So, they
got permission to leave. Sergeant
Stefins, interestingly, who was one of
the original two to see the lights, he
got pretty frightened by what he'd seen
in that little short uh walk into the
forest. And he got frightened because
when he got back to his vehicle, there
was a white spherical object, just a
light, sat on the road approximately 20,
30 meters away from their vehicle. And
that kind of freaked him out and it it
might well freak me out or you out. But
when he went back, he was scared and he
said, "I don't want to go back out
there." So that's how Edmond Burus went
joined up with Ed Banzac and Sergeant
Jim Pennison. They go into the forest.
Now it gets confusing because Jim
Penniston will say that at one point the
radio started breaking up. So he said to
airman Ed Cabanzac, you stay here and
act as a radio relay and the re the and
it's often the case and I can validate
this from my time in the air force
police that we did things like that. You
could bounce the signal off. But he Jim
Penniston will say that the two of them
went forward. Eventually they they see
the lights and eventually they come to a
clearing. Now the story of Jim and John
is totally different. Jim Penniston will
say that he's the one that's got the
closest to it and he's walked around.
It's touched it. It's a physical object.
Uh whereas John Burroughs was perhaps 20
30 meters behind him maybe blinded by
the
lights. Uh but he says he saw a bank of
lights that suggested there was a
structure behind it and that's maybe
possible because different perceptions
the depth perception. So essentially
there was something there that is
corroborated but that's essentially the
first night but what people don't talk
about is when they're walking back later
on after the incident another be before
you go into that though I want to get
the detail of what Jim Penniston says he
saw close up. So this is where an
allegedly triangular shaped craft about
2 m high, 3x3 m in in dimensions that's
either landed on the ground or hovering
just above the ground. Yep. Yep. And and
he said it was he says it was like
opaque glass, black glass. He said it
was warm to the touch, felt like glass.
And he said at one point there were
etchings. And at one point he found some
symbols that he wrote down in his
pocketbook.
Okay. And you find Jim Penniston a
credible witness, don't you? I do to
that first incident. Where I have red
flags as a former detective is when 30
years later he told the audience at a
community center uh 30th anniversary uh
conference uh that uh he'd had a
download of material. Now I'm not saying
downloads can't happen. I I think it's
possible that you can. But there were
many things that he said that were
inconsistent. He basically didn't tell
anybody for 30 years. And there's lots
of inconsistencies that I go in the
book. So for me he comes out with what's
called the binary codes which were a
number of pages he'd written in his book
which were then later analyzed and
suggested places like Giza coordinates
that it was time travelers from the
future I think 8,100 years in the future
coming back to earth. It's a standalone
story. No corroboration. And and
crucially, at the time when he gave his
statement originally, he never mentioned
any of this stuff about a download. He
never mentioned what he'd written down
in his diary, in his notebook, and there
was nothing of this kind of detail. That
that I agree is a bit of a red flag. the
the pocketbook that you now see in all
the documentaries didn't surface until
about
1997, which is a red flag in itself. You
know, he retired, I think, 198 1993. So,
why didn't it come out? One of the
things I'd want you to talk about is
John Barrows because John Barrows is a
really interesting case because he
suffered some kind of physical injury as
a result of alleged exposure. talk me
through that because I know I spoke once
to Senator John McCain uh when he was on
the campaign trail and I actually asked
him about the John Burrows case and he
mentioned it and talked about how he'd
assisted Burrows to procure his medical
records because the defense department
was resisting release of them. Yeah,
John Burrows is an interesting figure,
but he's not the only one. There are at
least five who sustained injuries, which
we can talk about in a bit. But with
with regards to John Burroughs, he was
obviously in close proximity, but what a
lot of people don't realize is that John
had multiple encounters over that
Christmas period. Uh he was involved
with an incident with Sergeant Adrien
Bastenza, the person who I says is a
great linking character. And uh
essentially when Hol's team had gone
out, they were out for about four and a
half hours trapesing round following
lights. Uh and they saw multiple objects
and that was the night after the
Penniston Burrows incident. Yeah, this
was two nights later. Two nights later.
Okay. And so Holt leads a team out. Uh
cutting a long story short, they see
multiple UFOs in the sky. uh some of
them shining beams down in the direction
of the nuclear weapons storage area at
Bentwaters. But eventually after 4 and a
half hours they come back to what's
called the staging area. Now the staging
area is an interesting and it's a key
place because it's where the vehicles
couldn't go any further into the forest.
So you had a collection of maybe eight
or nine vehicles and maybe 20 or 30 US
Air Force police basically just waiting
for orders milling around because Halton
said I want everybody staying back. I'm
going out with my team. Now, John Burus
wasn't a part of that team at the time.
He was off duty. He lived in Ipsswitch,
seven, eight miles away and he managed
to get a lift in. He had a sense that
something was going on. Well, cutting a
long story short, as we say in
England, he went he when Hulk came back
with his team of which Sergeant Adrien
Bastenza was one of
them. So, which is interesting. So,
Bastenza has just come back. Halt just
comes back. Uh John Boris says, "Can I
go out in the forest?" And so Hull for
whatever reason says, "Yeah, okay. Go
for a short time if you need to go out
there." And he asked Sergeant Adrien
Bastenza to go with him. Now he's just
come in after 4 and a half hours of
tramping around, but he agreed to go.
Now, as they walking the two of them
away from everybody else, and the exact
position of where this occurs is not
identified, but it's close to the
farmer's field. A very strange thing
happens. Adrien Bastenza, this is from
his perspective, he will say that he
felt uh like he was pushed from behind
and he fell forward onto his knees. And
as he did so, putting his hands down on
the ground, an in an incredible bright
white light engulfed John Burroughs, who
was maybe 20, 30 feet in front of him on
this pathway. And when he looked
forward, he saw that John who was like
6'6, huge guy. On the left of him in
within this light was a small life form
figure. And on the other side there was
another small 4T 5T figure with big John
in the middle engulfed in this
incredible light. Now, here's an
interesting thing that when that light
was cast on John, part of it cast on
Adrien Bastenza on his groin area and
his fingers and he's had rashes there
ever since. So, that's a knock-on
effect. So when John maybe had a really
close encounter, it was then uh because
that affected his heart muscles and he
later on uh was very ill, nearly died
and and he eventually got help uh and he
and he was saved through medical
operations. But his file and crucially
and crucially the thing that I've always
been fascinated by is am I wrong in
saying what Senator McCain told me which
is that John Burrow's illness was
attributed to his service. Well, if John
Burrows if if John McCain said that to
you as a direct comment from him, then I
would take it as red. when when John
eventually uh got help uh through John
McCain uh had got paid out and he got
treated whatever.
Um John released a press release that
basically said this is totally
attributable to Rendlesum Forest by
Encounter. Now I immediately uh emailed
him and said look I I don't want to know
the figures that you got from the VA
anything like that but can I see that
document uh because I want to see it in
writing as it were and he didn't release
it and so what I'm saying is there is
actually no corroboration that that is a
a tied to it although everybody thinks
that it is the the thing about this
whole incident and you and I have had
this experience even talking about it
you know even my limited understanding
of the case is clearly not consistent
with what you've been told in your more
recent research with witnesses. It It's
clear as you say there were a lot more
events than we've been ever told about
the Rendlessham Forest case. It wasn't
just one event in particular that the
News of the World story focused on in uh
198 1983. Yeah. It it was actually
multiple events and as you say there are
17 17 events. I mean, let me tell you
about some of these new events, new
accounts that nobody had ever heard of
uh that are in the book. Uh there was a
guy called Airman uh uh Steve Wagner,
and he'd had an earlier sighting during
1980. And I write in the book that there
were three important precursor cases
leading up to those late December events
that are important because they're all
UFO related. And surely if we're talking
about UFOs and why they're interested in
the Twin Bases that they're a part of
the story and he'd had a sighting of his
own in I think was November just a month
before. Now when he reported it
officially seeing a small glowing red
ball about the size of a beach ball near
the flight line near to the weapon
storage area. So it was near aircraft
and it was on area of Bentwaters, not in
the forest, on Bentwaters, near to the
weapon storage area. When he reported
that officially, he was given a hard
time. We don't want to know about this
blah blah blah. You keep quiet about
this by his bottle. So you're in no
doubt there was a cover up. And do you
think it was a lot to do with the fact
that whatever these objects were, they
were clearly taking an interest in the
weapon storage area where thermonuclear
B61 nuclear bombs were stored. Yes. And
and and and there's a couple of things
that back that up. Not only did uh a lot
of the airmen very reluctantly I might
add because they were very loyal to
their oath that they' taken and they
didn't want to get in any trouble but
eventually they' said yeah we regarding
tactical nuclear weapons including
Sergeant Adrien Bustin including another
guy called airman Steve Lgerro including
Steve Wagner who I'm just talking about
now uh
essentially Hulk told me on two
occasions the first night I ever met him
in December 2007 for filming for the UFO
Hunters TV series for the History
Channel. We were in the pub together.
We'd arrived more or less at the same
time. He didn't know me, but I knew him.
And so for me, it was a big thrill. I'd
been invited on because of my previous
uh RAF experience. And I said to him,
you know, I have you still got secrets?
And he basically said, well, I've got a
few things if ever I need to use them.
Never really told him what were. But in
the process of that conversation, he
said there were more nuclear weapons at
Arif Bentwaters underground than
anywhere else in Britain. And then later
on when we're doing that walk around the
forest in 2010, as was attested to and
witnessed by my second wife Lynn, she
heard him say there were more nuclear
weapons at Arif Bentwaters than anywhere
else in Europe. Now, it was a nuclear
base and in the book I find a document
that proves that Bentwaters had nuclear
weapons, but it's the amount and I think
that that is the key to the story. They
turn up because there's a nuclear
weapons inspection. I think of sort.
Now, Gary, I'm I'm going to surprise you
with this question because you're not
expecting it. And this might be
something that takes you down a path
you've never gone down before. In the
course of my research into psionic
operations secretly conducted by the US
Air Force, it has been suggested to me
that there was an extra presence at the
base in this period that a large
aircraft was deployed. I think it was um
a big C5 Galaxy C5 Galaxy. And that
there was a team located at a far end of
the base doing operations that people
weren't aware of.
It has been suggested to me that Raph
Bentwaters might have been being used
for experimental psionic operations and
that what brought the craft down might
have been one of these people who are
psionic attempting to engage with the
craft and disrupt it to bring it down so
that they could recover it. Maybe
Rendlessham was a secret attempt at a
craft retrieval. What do you say to
that? Uh I that's not beyond the realms
of possibility, but the the evidence for
that is is slim at the moment. Uh what I
can say is that a number of witnesses,
military witnesses I spoke to confirmed
that a C5 Galaxy
uh landed uh that it parked up at the
end of Arith Woodbridge at the runway
closest to the forest where a lot of the
events occurred and that a special team
wearing no insignia of any kind and even
Halt has mentioned this and confirmed
this on a couple of occasions that they
went out into the forest and did
something. Uh, and that basically they
were told, everybody else was told,
"Leave them alone. They can do whatever
they want." And this is before the
incidents took place that were recorded
of the UAPs or afterwards? As far as I'm
aware, the witnesses that I've spoken to
and at least three have told me this, it
was after the incidents.
Now, you know, just just to bring this
into perspective, the more you dig, the
more you're likely to find. And it's
still an evolving story. I still think
there are many more witnesses there uh
ready to come out but a lot of them have
been put off by all the infighting the
arguing amongst the different witnesses
and different agendas seem to be at
place and I think it's a shame because
it's a brilliant case.
Yeah. So you've never heard any
suggestion that there were psionics
people with psychic abilities brought to
the base to endeavor to try to connect
with these objects? No, but I can tell
you an interesting story. Uh, and it's
an anecdote, but it may well tie into
this.
Um during the oh many many years ago uh
perhaps 2011 2012 I got an email uh from
somebody who purported to be a colonel
and who'd been there during the events
and he said he was a radar specialist
and he said that they were trying all
this different stuff to try to engage
right I've never gone public with this
until now in the sense of this and I had
a long series of emails
And it sounded really really plausible
that they were messing with
highfrequency radars and we know that it
was a radar hotspot for many many years
and that something had happened that had
brought something in. Now that sounds
very much a bit like a psionic kind of
element. However, where it got
interesting and kind of faded for me is
after maybe having 10 email interactions
and I've still got them. Eventually, I
said, "Okay, it's very interesting uh
what you're saying, but I need you now
to prove to me who you are and what you
are. You need to show me your
credentials, and I'll keep them
confidential, but you need to prove to
me you are the real deal." And at that,
he never came back to me. So, for me, I
could never brief it publicly. I won't
go out with the story as such, but
that's what his story was. and it
sounded very compelling, but when I
asked for the corroboration, he he
wouldn't give me any.
So let's just accept for the benefit of
the rest of this conversation that we
agree that something anomalous happened
in Rendlessham forest that was reported
by and on the base multiple multiple
witnesses and and that included as you
say on the base we we saw craft shooting
beams of light down near the near or on
the weapon storage area. I've got a
direct witness who was inside the weapon
storage area. Airman Steve Longerro. He
said, "I'm inside." And the beam comes
down and it does like a grid-like
pattern search of the entire hot rope
approximately 300 meters long. One other
thing you talk about is radar. It was
the case that these objects were
detected on radar. True.
Initially at the time they would go on
to when the incidents were happening
halt would say that they tried to get
rid of eastern radar. Uh that yeah brief
blit near the forest. Uh there was one
later information that came out in the
late 90s that said an object had been
seen near Rendles at 37,000 ft then
dipped off the radar. But what was later
interesting is uh and I'm sure you know
of him Robert Hastings in UFOs and
nukes. fantastic book. Arguably one of
the top five books ever written on the
subject. Brilliant book. Yeah,
absolutely. And he found two American uh
radar operatives who went public in 2004
in his book and then in his documentary
in 2008 and they basically said they'd
been in the air traffic control tower
when one of the objects had actually
been next to the the tower. So yeah,
clearly there is radar, but a lot the a
lot of the time, especially in UK cases
when things are seen on radar, uh people
turn up the next day, a bit like the
Nimmits and the Tic Tac, somebody goes
on and says, "Give us your tapes, never
to be seen again." Well, that happened
at RAF1.
What we do know is that there is a
consistent pattern of accounts from
multiple witnesses that there were
interrogations. Yep. And some attempt at
a cover up. Talk me through that. Right.
Uh we talked about injuries. We can go
on to that. In terms of
interrogations, the people that have
confirmed that they had severe
interrogations and actually Halt has
gone on the record to say they were
interviewed very aggressively by unknown
bodies as it were and given a very hard
time which is wrong but essentially
Sergeant Jim Penniston. So he's the
first night landing the small triangular
craft. So it makes sense that he gets a
hard time. And they kept saying to him,
they gave him sodium pentathol and the
truth serum and they said, "Keep drawing
it. Draw it. Draw it for me. Draw it for
me." So they gave him, you're very clear
that he was given sodium pentathol. How
did he know that he was given sodium
pentathol? Why would he even know that?
He was told that. He was told that when
he was being aggressively interrogated.
That's all you can say. By multiple uh
groups. This wasn't just one
interrogation. He had multiple uh rein
and some of these were really aggressive
and he said that at one point he was
told that uh could they give him sodium
pentathol uh because they wanted to get
to the truth and they kept saying to him
draw it draw it and that's the craft in
his pocket draw it draw it uh so that's
one you then get um now interestingly
John Burroughs don't really he gets
interviewed but he's not given a hard
time he's never really talked talked
about interrogation, but the driver who
was also part of that three-man team
originally, Airman Kabanzi, he was given
a hard time. He was told to sign a
statement that he hadn't written. It's
the lighthouse. It's the lighthouse.
It's not the lighthouse. So, that
happened. Sergeant Adrien Bastenzu
corroborates Warren's account of the
second landing. He said he was
threatened with death if he spoke out.
Bullets are cheap. Now, Larry Warren had
also said that he'd been interrogated,
taken to an underground facility under
the base photo lab, which everybody
denies, but both and uh Larry Warren say
that they went underground to a facility
under the uh base photo lab and that
they were given a hard time.
When you read my book in the interview
that I did with uh uh with Adrien
Bastenza, he was almost in tears uh when
he was telling me this because he was
reliving this nightmare and he said, "I
was disgusted. There I am a sergeant in
the US Air Force. I I you know, I've
just got caught up in something. They're
now telling me that if I don't do what
they want, they're going to kill me."
And he he said I felt like running away
and going awall, absent without leave,
deserted. is that's how bad he felt and
when you read that I part of the
transcript it's almost palpable of the
pressure that he was put under and his
later on his family was surveiled for
for a long time now in the and just just
slow down a bit I mean with Bastenza he
tried to call his mom didn't he and then
the phone call was cut off is that
Bastenza who made that no that's Larry
Warren Larry that's Larry Warren that's
Larry Warren and I spoke I spoke to uh a
lady who was present
uh uh
uh at the receipt of that call, her best
friend was Larry Warren's mom and she
was in the room when that call came in
and she uh she said no absolutely
happened as were it was cut off. So
Larry's Larry's basically telling his
mom what happened in the incident and
then all of a sudden the call gets cut.
Yeah. And then he realizes that he's in,
for one of a better word, because he's
he's releasing details of something that
they're obviously trying to contain. So
his call was being monitored clearly by
somebody. Yeah. He he ended up paying a
I think a $300 fine for that for that
discrepancy of using the light. So could
I ask you this because Larry Warren, I
think, has cpped more criticism than
most. He's been called he's been called
a liar, a fabricator, a fraud. People
have claimed he wasn't where he said he
was. I'm quite shocked to actually read
in your book, Non-Human, that you
actually give quite a bit of credibility
to Larry Warren. What What do you say
about Larry Warren's
evidence? The the reality is is there
corroboration? And there is not just in
Sergeant Adrien Bastenza. When I did the
research, and if you realize in in in
one of the chapters of the book, uh
Larry Warren wasn't the first one to
talk about aliens. There was somebody
else within days of the incident who was
a sergeant in the US Air Force police
who'd spoken to a friend of his who
turns out to be one of the early British
civilian investigators, a woman called
uh Dob Butler and and and he he knew her
from on the base through social events
and he told her about aliens had been
seen in a craft in the forest. That's
where that eventual first story came. So
it wasn't Warren making it up and there
were 14 or 15 other part corroborations
of the story.
Do you think it's possible that either
the US Air Force or whoever it was that
was doing these
interrogations or perhaps perhaps if
these were non-human entities the
non-human entities did something to
meddle with people's perception people's
accounts because one of the things about
the case I I accept that there are there
are always going to be inconsistencies
in witness statements I mean you'd know
that as a copper I know that as a
journalist People often get their facts
wrong, they get times wrong, dates
wrong, series of events wrong, but it
does seem weird to me in the case that
there's so much contradictory evidence
about what happened when. And I think
your explanation of the fact that there
were actually 17 separate incidents is
actually quite compelling. It also
raises a question in my mind whether
something or someone was meddling with
the minds of these people. We we do know
that the phenomenon slide N people talk
about how it can manipulate human
perception. Do you think something's
been getting into these people's heads?
I think it's entirely possible. uh in
terms of you know after effects after
the incidents there's none really
mentioned but if you think that um a lot
of them suffered well let's put it this
way there's if you were going to
interrogate people because they'd seen
something they really shouldn't have
done you'd go for the principal
witnesses so let's think about this
Penniston principal witness he gets a
really hard time John Boris less so
Edanzac he was Hey, he saw lights
through the forest gets a really hard
time. Larry Warren, he gets a really lot
of hard
time. Adrien Bastenza, who corroborates
this second landing. Now, doesn't that
tell you something that the the key
people that eventually saw the two
landings in effect the two landings,
they're the ones getting the hard time.
And in terms of injuries, Bustins had
the injuries through the light. Larry
Warren had about four years later
developed bleeding from the neck. And
when he was examined, they said, "Have
you been anywhere near radiation?" Uh,
John Burroughs got the And here's
another one. Jim Penniston got injuries,
although I've never really been
specified, but he said he got injuries
and he got paid out by the VA. But
here's the absolute secret one. When I
spoke to the Canadian researcher Grant
Cameron, he'd heard that the CIA, a guy
called Kit Green, Dr. Kick green. You
may have heard of him. He'd been doing a
test of people who'd been in close
proximity. And I brought him over for a
conference. I used to do conferences.
And I brought him over and I knew Grant
pretty well. And anyway, I sat him down.
I said, "Uh, I understand that some of
the Reynolds witnesses have been
interviewed as part of this program,
Close Proximity with injuries." And he
said, "Yeah." He said, "Yeah, there were
I think there were three Reynolds
witnesses." I said, "Oh, three." I said,
"Who's that then?" And he went uh Jim
Pennison, John Burrows, i.e. from the
first night, and guess who was the third
one who was never supposed to be there?
Colonel Gordon Williams, the base. Oh,
really? Yes. That's interesting because
it's interesting. One of the one of the
details in your book that leapt out at
me was I think it was Bastenza said he
saw Colonel Gordon Williams, the base
commander in a silent face off escorting
a film or a video that had been shot of
the craft to an aircraft. That uh that
that's that's a captain who does that.
Uh he basically picks him up uh after
the incident uh and his uh Colonel
Williams is got a top secret satchel or
bag, some kind of hold that's top
secret. And he says, "Uh, Colonel,
what's in the bag?" And he said, "It's
film of the UFO." This is directly after
the incident, this second landing, this
controversial, it never happened, but it
really did. And it was filmed incident.
And he said he told him, he told him it
was the moving picture video, motion
picture. So film, not not still
pictures. And he said he drove him up to
an F6 F-18 I think F-16. And he said the
pilot, he went it up, went up the little
ladder, handed it to the pilot, canopy
came down, plane took off, and
apparently the film, he says, "Where's
it going to?" And he says, "It's going
to Rammstein who's the head of the
eighth air force in Europe." So that
would make sense. But here's another
interesting thing that comes out in the
book. Later on, uh, we know it got to
the Pentagon because a American
researcher called Ray Busher did some
great work for three years on Reynolds,
uh, for Muon and he probably did the
best bit of research in the 80s and he
said at one point he got familiar
because he kept putting in FOI requests
to the lady who ran the FOI desk at the
Pentagon and he got he did it so much
that he they kind of became friends, a
firstname basis.
And eventually she told him that uh this
is interesting. I've just heard some
pilots, American pilots talking about
the Rendlessham film. And she said,
"I've looked, there's nothing in our
records about Rendlessham film." So she
actually corroborated that the film
probably at some point got to the
Pentagon where it it still may be in
the, you know, the Raiders of the Lost
Dark big archive.
Well, certainly somebody didn't want the
full Rendlessham story being told. I I
still wrestle with why. If it's true
that Lieutenant Charles Halt, sorry,
Lieutenant Colonel Charles Halt knew
more than he's letting on. I still
wrestle with why he came public with the
memo that he did come up with. Why
didn't the US Air Force just tell him
and everybody else to shut up about it?
Why did they volunteer to the Defense
Department? Ross, you must understand
that they did. The US Air Force was
bombarded with inquiries after the Hulk
memorandum came out. Uh, tell us about
this. But prior to that, they'd been
bombarded by little snippets in the
press. Tell us that nothing's happened.
Nothing's happened. Eventually, the memo
comes out and then they have to admit
that two incidents took place because
it's in the memo. So you think the halt
memo might have been an attempt by the
US to try to play down to allay public
ser? And there's a there and I mentioned
it in the book. There's a very famous
clip that James Fox got with Colonel
Gordon Williams who retired as a a twoar
general I might add and and he's he's
been playing golf I think and he's
leaning against his car at the end of a
round and James Fox interviews him and
basically comes out with something that
later came back as a recurring theme. He
said once the memo came out, it lived a
life of its own because we couldn't put
Humpty back umpty Dumpty back together
again. And but what it said was we had
to admit it when the memo came out
because it was on noted US Air Force
paper. We couldn't deny it. Haltered
tried to get that pulled. He knew that
his life would never be the same. He was
told it will never come out that memo.
So when William said that, he basically
was saying that yes, we've got to admit
the two incidents that's in the memo,
but we're not going to admit to anything
else. But crucially, you're the copper,
you're the detective, you've spoken to
all the witnesses. Yep. Do you think
Charles Halt saw a craft that night? And
did he also did he also see entities? Do
you think he saw aliens? I suspect yes
because uh Warren and Bustins will both
say that uh uh that he's there as as was
Colonel Williams in that field. So
there's multiple corroborative
witnesses. What did the commander Gordon
Williams say? Did he deny any knowledge
of He denied ever being in the field. He
denied ever responding to it. He was in
his office uh just listening to a little
updates on the radio. He's the base
commander of 12,000,000 personnel. Do
you think he'd not be informed or not
really be there? Uh it's ludicrous. But
that was the big secret. That was the
story.
So somewhere in the dark recesses of the
Pentagon, as you say, a Raiders of the
Lost Dark archive, there may very well
be film or video of what we're talking
about. Yes, I I I absolutely believe
that that film did exist and that the
cameras were there. I mean, bustins are
corroborated. There were cameras there
and it was motion picture. Uh I it there
are so many things. What you've got to
understand going back to your Larry
Warren point was that the first person
that came out and said put his name to
it and said, "This is what I saw. I
don't know what anybody else saw, but
this is what I saw was Larry Warren in
late 1982.
He was on his own. before and that's
before the Hulk memo came out. Yeah.
Yeah. He was telling that in in late
December 1982 and uh
basically what emerged was that he was
the only one in the public eye doing
media interviews for about eight years
and the only time his credibility was
attacked was as soon as Hol retired in
91 when uh Boros retired in I think 95
and then Pennison in 93. Then they all
said, "Nah, this is not." Which does put
a whole new perspective and complexion
on
Halt's coming out publicly and speaking
because the implications are that, God
forbid, Colonel Charles Halt might have
been part of the cover up, not part of
the attempted disclosure. I believe
that's likely to be the case. He was
never he according to Hull and I knew
him well uh he did not ever get uh
interrogated questioned about his
involvement which is a bit odd. Did you
ever hear any any reference by Charles
Halt to
STS24 a particular US Air Force unit?
No.
I'm told he may have been a member of a
very elite US Air Force unit.
I do think Charles Halt, Colonel Charles
Halt has a very interesting story to
tell and he knows a lot more. Well, I
can can I just there's one little story.
I know that time will be going on, but
this is really pertinent. When I looked
at some of the research, old research, I
came across a document by that same muon
researcher uh called Ray Busher who'
actually was the first person ever to
ring up Halt. He was still in the Air
Force six years before he retired. He
rings him up and he says, "I am Ray
Busher. I work for Muon. I'm researching
this incident and the memorandum blah
blah blah." And he was nice as private
in Moshalt. Uh and then he said, "Uh,
I'm doing some research for Sergeant uh
for uh Senator uh uh Exxon who was on
the armed services committee and Ray
Busher lived in Nebraska. So he said,
"You should be interested in this
because uh this is American air and you
know, you should be interested in this
case." and he said, "Well, if you bring
me more evidence, I'll look into it."
Well, he rings up Hol out the blue holtz
six years before he retires and he
explains all this to him and he says,
"Well, Larry Warren, a witness has said
that you were there, that this happened,
that this happened the the second
landing in the farmer's field. Uh, and
it was being filmed and there was
security police personnel around it."
And Hol said, and he wrote it down
verbatim. He said, "Yeah, I can verify
all of that. I can substantiate all of
that for the senator.
Uh, so he thought he was talking to
somebody working for the senator. No,
no, he knew he was talking to a UFO
researcher, but at that time before he
was this public figure, he just admitted
in a perfect admission that uh that the
incident in the field had happened, a
second landing, that it was surrounded
by security police, that uh uh entities
had been seen, and that it was being
filmed. And he just said, "Yeah, I can
verify all of that." which all
underlines how the Rendlessham incident
is probably the most recent UAP sighting
of all time. So Gary, before we go, how
can people get hold of copies of your
book, Nonhuman? It's only available on
Amazon. I self-published it not because
I had I didn't go to a mainstream
publisher because I knew that I wanted
to get the story out and I didn't want
to be blocked by anybody. There's so
many agendas at play in this story. I
thought I want to get the facts out and
as soon as it went out so it's only
available on Amazon in whichever country
uh and and you'll find it 1799 500
pages. Well, the one thing we can be
sure of in all of the mystery of the
Rendlessham forest ref Bentwaters
refridge incident is that what is it
gosh 1980 that's uh 45 years on the
cover up continues.
