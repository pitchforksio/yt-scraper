Good day and welcome back to Reality
Check. I'm your host, Ross Kulart, and
I'm very excited to bring you today's
story. One thing I love as a journalist
is a mystery, especially a mystery that
involves Soviet spies, espionage,
secret Soviet techniques of technology,
uh all sorts of goings on with science
and UFOs,
love, romance, and of course, a sworthy
hero. Our hero today is a dashing
American Jean Stiko who's a decorated
bronze star, no less US Air Force
veteran. Jean's got an illustrious
career in intelligence and security. At
19, he was a member of the presidential
honor guard in Washington DC. And he
went on to serve in some of the world's
most volatile regions, including Somalia
and the Balkans. He was eventually
selected for elite duties working with
special forces operations, army rangers,
SEALs, and the toll left him with a 100%
disability.
But he headed into working as what's
euphemistically called a global security
expert. He then worked in high-risk
operations within corporations like
Shell Oil and even Australia's BHP.
Then he moved into strategic
intelligence and operational planning.
And he had a client list there that
includes an alphabet soup of
three-letter government agencies in the
US, including the DoD, the Defense
Department, the CIA, the FBI, Homeland
Security, and the Department of Energy.
Now, this wouldn't be right without a
romance. And so along the way in 2017,
he meets a stunningly beautiful woman,
Natalyia Chernah. I think I've said that
correctly. Shout at me if I haven't,
Natalyia. Who is a celebrated Latian and
now internationally renowned messo
soprano opera singer. The sworthy hero
is swept off his feet. Q Bella likers.
They fall in love. They marry. They move
back to Boston. They have a son. This is
such a lovely story. And they even form
a local opera company.
But this is where it gets interesting.
You're all wondering what's this got to
do with UFOs, UAPs.
Well, all her life she's not known much
at all about her father, Valerius
Chernva.
But I sense though you think he was a
plumber, he was actually quite a humble
person. What you didn't know was that he
had a very interesting background. It
turns out your father was a Soviet
aerospace engineer. And as we are about
to learn, it may well be the case that
he spent decades attempting to reverse
engineer what appeared to be UAP
UFO nonhuman technology.
And I love this part of the story. I
love the fact that your little boy, when
he was a teenager, had expressed
interest in aerospace. And in 2019,
shortly before your daddy died, he sent
your son a package, a wrapped package.
And Natalyia, no disrespect to Jean, but
I think you need to kick off here. Tell
me what happened when you opened the
package.
>> To be honest with you, I was petrified
and mesmerized at the same time. So I
didn't know how to react right cuz uh it
was a bunch of scientific formulas at
the first glance but when actually I
started to pay close attention I figured
out it's not only formulas it's lots of
drawings and also when I looked at that
more attentively it looked like a flying
saucers engineering.
>> Now what did you know of your dad's work
as a young girl? All I remember was that
when he used to take me to his work as I
mentioned he used to be a plumber and he
used to have multiple sites where he did
this work. I remember him having a
briefcase and I remember him always
whenever he had a free minute he used to
work on this materials but back then I
didn't know what kind of materials they
were and what also
was amazing that he never used any
encyclopedias he never used any books it
was literally going by memory and just
writing whatever came to his mind so
this is what I remember
>> now Jean welcome to reality check let's
bring you in now Um, tell me about the
the moment that you saw this
extraordinary package that turned up in
your home from Valeris, Natalya's
father.
So it was, as she said, it was stunning
just to begin with, you know, and and
looking through those first few pages
and and the math, the physics, um, you
know, and and she started reading the
first couple of pages and she's like,
he's he's disputing Einstein's theory of
relativity. I'm like, what? You know,
you know, who does that, right?
um you know and she's just talking
through it and and again I had only met
him maybe three times over video
um before that all I knew were the
stories I got from the wife you know the
family the you know yeah smart guy kind
of wasted his life
you know
sad story never really recovered from
the fall of the Soviet Union and and as
we're flipping through them um and she's
talking about this, I'm torn between,
wow, was it, you know, real smart stuff
or, you know, is it sort of as his
ramblings? And then I got to the
drawings of the UFOs
and, you know, as you've seen, there's
there's no denying it. And so I'm asking
I'm asking that, what does this say
exactly? And she's like, "It's, you
know, the technical drawings of of the
UFO." And and that's the thing.
>> It says UFO. And she's like, "Yes, it
says the saucer." The UFO. The
>> So So he's saying the UFO. Are you
suggesting to me that you believe that
he had access to a craft? Do you believe
that these are drawings, these are
schematics based on something that he
was secret secretly working on as an
engineer?
>> Yes. So this we found out actually after
his death because I was never aware of
that. I heard some rumors as a kid but
again I couldn't trust back then because
of the political situation in the
country. However, after he died I became
close friends with his girlfriend who
was with him actually for a good time
before he died. And uh she actually
mentioned that he used to work in the
so-called secret zone uh back in USSR
which was called Prizors. And if you
want to find a comparison in the United
States, it's the so-called Area 51 back
there.
>> Wow. Now he was working at the Soviet
equivalent of Area 51.
>> Yes. And what's the funniest about that
turned out to be that my mom used to
actually live with him there
>> and she never told you about this?
>> No, never.
>> Wow.
>> I mean, she mentioned briefly, but she
didn't put emphasis on the fact that it
was a closed military base or military
city. She just briefly mentioned, oh, he
did some very strange refrigerator work
there, but she never actually mentioned
the exact name of the city.
>> So,
>> what do you know of your father's
qualifications? What was he an engineer?
>> He was an engineer. He graduated from
the so-called uh RIA Institute of Civil
Engineering and Civil Aviation uh which
is now known as Transport and Connection
Institute. And back then it was one of
the most uh famous universities across
the USSR. They were two there were like
one in K and one in Ria who were famous
for um
actually releasing engineers related to
civil aircraft.
>> When you were a little girl you don't
have any memory of your daddy meeting
strange people or having military
uniforms or officials around. There was
none of that.
>> That's a very good question. I don't
remember particularly military but I do
remember some interesting personalities
like uh the daughter of the French
ambassador if I remember correctly and
we used to hang out at your place. She
actually told me to taught me to knit
which I never could do before. Right.
And I think if I remember correctly,
this is something Jean found out later
>> that after USSR fell apart, was she the
main
>> person who was still connected to the
communist part of the USSR?
>> She was a woman that she remembered. And
when I tracked down who this woman was,
it turned out during the Soviet period
and afterwards she was essentially the
the head of the Latvian Communist Party.
Um after independence she went on to
found a um international uh law school
there
>> actually.
>> So your your dad never spoke to you at
all Natalya about what he did?
>> No, never. I was always thinking and
under impression that he does plumbing.
And of course I had questions as a kid
why a person who graduated from this
huge university which pretty much is
some sort of MIT similar to MIT but back
in the USSR and with emphasis on
aviation. Of course I kept on asking why
is he working as a plumber right
logically. But he's not the only one.
And of course, USSR made corrections
after it fell apart to lives of many
people. So I was thinking he's just the
unhappy person who couldn't find his
place under the sun after USSR collapsed
and had to do what he had to do just to
provide for his family. So that was my
understanding of the situation.
>> Okay. So let's cut to the quick. When
you scroll through and I've got them on
a page here in front of me. When you
scroll through that manuscript that he
sent your son,
>> you do you see images of a schematic
that he or somebody has drawn of what
looks like a classic hatshaped disc
flying saucer. The big question, of
course, Jean, is is this something that
he's just doodling in his sketchbook, or
is this something that when you read the
documents and you've now had them
translated that you can reach a
conclusion that they were based on
something more substantial?
>> Absolutely. So, that that became the
mission to understand what exactly these
things were and was it a a tabletop
hobby? Was it a piece of theoretical
work or was it exactly what it appeared
to be? This this engineering of of a
craft and I broke that down and chased
that down um in in several ways. Again,
you know, I I was retired. Now, you have
to understand when when this dropped in
our laps. And so, you know, I just had
to dust off the old skill set um and and
start breaking it down as methodically
as I could. And over the course of doing
that for the last four years and all the
inputs that we got in in in research and
all the rest of it, um the language
consistently
uh represents
that it is based on observation.
He does not use any language that is it
might be anything that would would
appear to be theoretical.
Um the the method and and the process
that he walks through very much
consistently
reads as observation, measurement, and
explanation. So, he's obviously
preparing this document, this package,
these works for somebody else, for
another audience.
>> Um, what one of the images that you've
got, and it it I love it cuz it's the
classic hat-shaped disc UFO. And, um,
for for the benefit of our editors, it's
image 6745.
And it seems to have dimensions. What
What does it show of the size of the
object?
So the object's about 30 mters in
diameter.
It's it's constructed in two solid
pieces.
Um and those pieces operate somewhat
independent even of of one another. Um
there's a he goes on he describes a a ca
a cabin um for the the pilots uh as
along with the um the the intricacies of
the system how it you know what's inside
how it operates how it works but 30
meters overall and the weight um I don't
remember offhand the exact weight of it
but I found that fascinating because it
was like the equivalent of 16 fully
loaded 740 7s.
>> Wow.
>> So, it was very, very heavy.
>> And does he talk about the metals that
are used to construct the object?
>> He does. He completely breaks them down.
They're siliconebased
um metal composits. Um he discusses how
those com how how those metals then
interact with the uh uh gravitational
and magnetic fields that it creates
around them. discusses how we create how
it creates those fields but the uh the
overlying they are siliconebased
uh alloys
and I mean again everything you're
talking about here the dimensions of the
object the weight of the object it does
suggest that he's doing these schematics
based on observation that this isn't
just speculative research where he's
designing a fictional UFO
>> well it's not only that, you know, and I
I always remind people, go back to the,
you know, put it in the context of time,
the 1980s, um, you know, through perhaps
as late as 2000. Um, so I primarily
focus on 80s through 90s, possibly a
little bit later of the work being uh
included in it. Those descriptions are
very consistent with what comes out from
Bob Lazar in the you know in the late
80s early 90s. It is um that we hear
through the late 90s.
>> Okay. So let's let's get into some of
the detail. But before I do, Natalyia,
I've got to come back to you here. I
mean, I love the fact that you've got
this daddy who never let on that he was
interested in UFOs. Had he ever talked
about UFOs?
The only thing I remember was that
he
mentioned right that UFO is some kind of
a way related to religion and god even
though he wasn't that religious right
and there was one saying which he always
repeated which uh if I remember
correctly went like the god is the time
if you want to understand the god you
have to understand the time right and
his whole idea was uh that yeah UFOs uh
if I remember correctly because again I
was little right and couldn't understand
much from what he was saying anyway
right so uh yes it's very much about
connect related to consciousness it's
related about with energies how people
think how people live right and uh yes
Jin can probably talk more because he's
more subject matter expert in the papers
no one I I'm really glad you mentioned
consciousness because I I have a thing
about consciousness and UAPs. Did I talk
about the importance of consciousness in
relation to understanding UAPs, UFOs?
>> Yes. So, uh there is probably that's not
a secret. So, in order to achieve
something, you have to believe in that.
Correct. The whole manifestation theory,
I'm not going to of course dig deep into
this cuz we are in another show, right?
But the whole idea is right there is
even a theory I think was it in the
book, right? that the when the
concentration of people who believe in
that that much and then they resonate
with the universe right then like the
sighting appear if I remember correctly
right so this is why I think he was uh
again going from the perspective of uh
mixing science and mixing science with
religion and explaining it all like with
you know like literal with you
>> I'm so happy because it seems she really
listens to me while I'm talking about
this stuff
>> right that's why I'm G G like thank god
he's retired because I have two day jobs
and my singing career correct so this is
why like he was but yeah like I was
paying close attention and that's what
I'm saying but if you ask me whether he
did talk about that yes he did but this
is what I remember correctly he was
always about you have to believe in
>> and if I can just a couple of things you
know Nat left out that are fascinating
too there was a point where she found a
pass in her father's briefcase to the
Duma the Russian parliament
and thought it was strange a plumber in
Latvia would have a pass to the Duma in
in Moscow. And and there were other
behavioral clues that you know were
relayed to us in in talking and again
that came back to memory like him him
not living in the dormatory suddenly in
university but going and living in a
private apartment. So again, you're
talking 1970s
Soviet Union,
somebody putting it up in a private
apartment. They don't do that for
everybody. So he sent you the manuscript
for your son in 2019. And I'm sorry to
have to raise sad issues, but how soon
afterwards did he pass?
>> Um, if I remember correctly, couple of
months.
>> Really?
>> Yes.
>> So he probably knew he was dying.
He
died actually uh was like 30th of
December 200. right before co this is
why I remember right and my
understanding of all that was um he was
very supportive of communism and Soviet
Union and u honestly right my
understanding of this move when he
signed he probably couldn't find support
there and he still wanted this papers to
go public probably
making AG do it not knowing we would
eventually do
And yes.
>> And so when he sent you these, did you
contact him and say, "Dad, what's all
this about?"
>> Unfortunately, I didn't have time
because we we received it like already
after he was dead. This is this is the
sad part of the story.
>> Yeah. So, we received them.
>> Yes. And we
>> And you know, at the time, we had been
living back in the US for for under a
year. So, we had Nat's immigration, AJ's
immigration. I think we we moved twice
like during a short period. We were in
an Airbnb I think when he initially Yes.
sent the you know so it was a and it was
the holidays so
>> they sat on the table
>> you know because again it was something
for AJ someday
>> and it actually was she had woke up
after he had passed she had woke up one
morning she had had a dream about him
and it was from that dream that I said
oh well where's the stuff he sent let's
open it and that's what happened
>> we pretty much didn't plan on opening
that till AJ probably would turn 18 and
went to college honestly
If it wasn't about the dream, right,
that would probably still stay in the
warehouse, right?
>> But you know, the really cool thing
about this is if this is what you
suspected is your dad looked at a
recovered alien spacecraft and has sent
your dear son AJ the schematics to help
him understand how it worked.
>> This is my understanding right now.
Yeah, I I think it was, you know, we and
and we we struggled with this a little
bit as a family, you know, um when we
made the decision to publish him, as Nat
said, he he was a diehard communist. He
was sincerely just figured everyone's
going to get their stuff together and
bring communism back and he just needed
to wait it out. Um you know, obviously
with my background, we had a lot of
laughs. Um you know, What did he think
about his daughter marrying a What did
his daughter think about his daughter
marrying a spook? You know, an American
spook
story about him which I recently
remembered, right?
>> So, I came to visit him back in 2016
and back then I wasn't even dating Gene.
I didn't know that Jean existed. I was
dating absolutely other person. And when
I came to visit my dad and this previous
boyfriend, he paid for all the trip. Uh
the first question my dad asked, "How is
your CIA guy doing?" Like which CIA guy
like the one who paid for this trip. So
I honestly had a wife. My dad is crazy
cuz I said honestly my previous
boyfriend didn't have anything to do
with CIA, right? But that was like that
was such a funny coincidence.
So did he could he read the future? was
because I treated him as dad is joking
and it's another dirty joke by dad or
whatever it is but fact is fact. So
>> back then do you think it's fair to say
Natalia he probably he probably didn't
tell you about the work that he done to
protect you?
>> I assume so. And I assume there is also
the so-called uh secret clearance or
whatever it's called here. And I assume
some kind of a similar situation is back
in USSR because uh one of my uh
non's brothers,
he also worked in a closed military
facility and as far as I'm aware, he
still can't leave Russia at all.
>> So that's a real thing there. Some of
the people, they can't even go visit a
neighbor. and your and and and your um
her his dad's girlfriend in a recent
catch up with her was talking about how
he he was under surveillance for by the
FSB for a period of time too
>> because my mom was thinking he's crazy,
right? I don't remember him being under
surveillance cuz he didn't talk to me
about that, but his girlfriend confirmed
he was and she saw it with her own eyes.
So that means my mom was just not being
the very transparent or some people they
exactly they prefer not to or they
pretend to
>> not see it.
>> Not see it, right? Just to protect
themselves cuz it's easier to live like
that. The less you know the better you
sleep as we say in Russia.
>> Now I love this story that he left it
for AJ your your teenage son.
>> Um and and he's apparently genuinely
interested in aerospace technology. So
maybe it runs in the family.
I think so because initially he wanted
to fly and now he's switching into maybe
going and becoming an engineer. So that
that's it. So there there's a check in
his mind.
>> That brings us to the next question for
you Jean. Obviously you've now done the
work as an intelligence analyst going in
and trying to make an assessment of
these documents. One of the things that
I think is really interesting is in the
time since you've written your book,
Engineering Infiniti, which is a a
website, correct me if I'm wrong, it's
engineering.com.
Is that correct?
>> Uh, engineeringfinitinitybook.com.
>> engineeringinfinitibook.com.
So, anyone can go and have a look at the
book and see the translation of the
manuscript that um, Jean's very kindly
organized. It's fascinating because I
read the whole thing through and I've
I've spoken to how does one say this
politely? a few people who have an
awareness of the the program, the covert
program that's being operated inside
America. And a couple of them weren't
even aware of your attempt to put this
book into the public domain, but they
were certainly aware of the Russian
work, the Soviet work on alleged
retrieved non-human craft. And what
fascinates me is their reaction. uh they
were very interested to engage with what
you've published. What have you found
Gan? Like what conclusions can we come
to? We know for example that in the last
few months George Knapp fellow
journalist George Knapp was um very uh
good in bringing forward the thread
three documents which are Soviet era
documents which George was given by
former Soviet scientists from the former
Soviet Union. He bravely smuggled them
out of the former Soviet Union, brought
them then to the United States, shared
them with um Robert Bigalow and his team
that were doing work with various
American intelligence agencies. And
those documents in the main until very
recently haven't been released. I think
there's about 25 pages in what George
put into Congress, but apparently
there's several hundred pages in what
George actually put as an exhibit before
Congress. There's there's some disparity
between what George actually tabled and
what has now been made public. But what
conclusions have you been able to reach,
Jean, based on looking at what George
was able to obtain from Soviet era
scientists about the Russian UFO program
and what Valeris Chernah was able to
find in his sketches.
>> What George produced
um was for me in many ways a holy grail.
I mean it was a a link that really
solidified
in my mind if there you know in
intelligence we speak in terms of
confidence and I always had medium to
high confidence in the authenticity of
the project as being the reverse
engineering of a UFO with the thread 3
documents that went to high confidence
um because they specifically
are. So, I should reframe that my
father-in-law's work is a specific work
product of those orders. And so, as I
>> just explain that to me,
>> why why do you say they're connected?
Why do you say you can see links between
the thread three documents that George
got from the former Soviet Union and
what um Valeris Natalya's dad had in his
notebooks?
>> Sure. So within the the thread three
orders and and it breaks down the
program itself where it's the military
component and then the civilian
component. The civilian component
involves about five agencies
um primarily academic institutions I
should say uh that each have a a
different level of expertise. A couple
of those organizations are actually
organizations that were in Priazerk.
Um so the the the process to bring it
you know through to everybody was the
Russians went forward with this plan to
establish the uh anomalous aerial
phenomenon study. The military would um
retrieve materials and conduct
interviews. It would then dispatch to
whichever appropriate institution if it
was more atmospherically related,
communication signal related, materials
related, they would filter those
materials to an institution for study
and engineering and then there was to be
a body of engineering work. Further
within the orders, it talks about um not
specifically craft but you know speaks
in terms of materials
um of uh propulsion of um I think at one
point it even mentions the solenoids.
So there's there are parameters within
those orders that say you know by this
order we will study these 1 2 3 4 five
things and my father-in-law's work are
those 1 2 3 4 five things when it
directly relates to you know materials
let's say because you know I think this
is part of the problem even in in US and
disclosure you're not you're not going
to find a big file with you know a giant
UFO stuff written on it. The language is
always going to be massaged and and
carefully crafted
um in in in how they do that. But let
let's deal with some specifics. For
example, um, in the Chennah manuscript,
Engineering Infinity that you've put
into the book called Engineering
Infinity, there's a system blueprint for
a pulseed reactor which has MHD, which I
presume is a magneto hydrodnamic drive.
Is that correct?
>> Correct.
>> Mhm.
>> And what's a Meg takeoff solenoid
arrays? What's a MEG MEG?
Uh, I believe that's magnetic. Yeah, the
mag if we're talking about solarid
arrays, then it's the the magnetic
>> magnet
energy generator or something,
>> right? So, the craft the craft he
describes basically operates. It
manipulates and then creates its own
field to live and operate in by
manipulating gravity and magnetism of
the the the planets. the bodies that
it's that it's operating in.
>> Correct. There is I think the whole
section which actually described the
different gravitational uh parameters of
different planets. That's that was like
this is why we found out probably how it
is connected,
>> right? So, so it it it creates these
fields
>> within the craft itself. It uses a
solenoid array.
>> That solenoid array is powered by
electricity.
that is generated through a compact
thermonuclear system
>> that converts heavy water dutarium to
plasma to create the electricity to
power the solenoids to create the
magnetic fields
>> and remember neither of our physicists
>> and I am not full scientific disclosure
if you haven't guessed by now
>> I used to have a physics back in the
university but that was not that much to
understand all But Gene did a phenomenal
job.
>> No worries. But but the thing that I
find fascinating is you've also Gene
gone in and looked at Russian patents
and there are patents which disclose
buildable magneetto hydrodnamic power
takeoff plans plasma propulsion modules
field thrust and there's even some
patents that talk about an integrated
vehicle with MHD magneto hydrodnamics.
So essentially the propulsion system you
believe is this plasma magneto
hydrodnamics that that Valeris was
exploring which is also reflected in the
patents that you've discovered from that
era.
>> Exactly. You know again from the intel
investigative background um you know I I
look at this book as a as a as a
resource. It's a timestamp. it is a
utility
um to all things anomalous aircraft
aerial phenomenon. And not only did I
find, you know, and what led to all that
was really the the idea of foyer
requests and and hearing the stories and
and the uh the challenges when people
investigating this put in foyer. And it
was literally about 2:00 a.m. one
morning, I woke up with this this
revelation, an epiphany, if you will. I
said, "Well, what if we just don't ask
about UFOs and UAPs anymore? Because
here we have this consistent body of
work that's describing the reverse
engineering of a UFO. Let's just ask
about the science."
And so I started down this path of
extracting the the core scientific
domains and then seeing what was out
there and what was out there led
directly to patents not only from Russia
but from the United States as well. Now
that's that's the led to programs and
all the I hope I didn't get ahead of you
but
>> you know that was it started with the
patents um and and and some of them came
to me from outside people who looked at
it and they said this looks a lot like
this and we started comparing it and
saying yeah it does. So let's just get
to that because as well as the Russian
patents for magneto hydronodnamics MHD
you also discovered the Americans at
pretty much the same timeline were were
looking at pl patents for extreme plasma
compression propellantless
electromagnetic drive architectures
a neutronic fusion concepts inertial
control which are all very similar to
what the Russian papers were talking
about and Valer's manuscript,
>> right? As as Nat said, not a scientist,
but I know patterns that, you know,
that's always that's always been the
strength and and that's what I began to
see developing. And there is a you know
there there's certainly an argument to
be made and it might be one that comes
right to top of mind of of anybody
hearing you know this story for the
first time that that's science that's
existed for a long time. It existed
before Jerev was born. Um what makes it
compelling is when you put put it
together. It's one thing to
study a scientific topic in isolation.
It becomes another thing when you pair
it with a second topic, a third topic, a
fourth topic and when those topics are
then replicated throughout another
system. though replicated throughout the
Sovian system, replicated throughout the
US system. You you begin to strip away
coincidence
and parallel science and hot topic of
the day um when you look at how the
three each attempt to relate these
topics to one another and it's all in a
very specific consistent way. So
Natalia, I know from what George Nap
talked about in the fall of the Soviet
Union when George was over there, there
were Soviet scientists falling over
themselves to share secrets with the
West. But your dad, as Gina has said,
was obviously a very committed communist
and still very much a believer in the
old system. Were there colleagues of his
though, workmates that you've been able
to make contact with? Is there anyone
that he worked with that you've been
able to speak to who has confirmed your
father's secret work with the former
Soviet Union as an aerospace engineer?
>> That's a very good point. Unfortunately,
not. And I assume that was the part of
him protecting me from knowing too much.
>> This is my guess.
>> Yeah. I mean, I I I guess if there is
anybody watching this who knows anything
about the Soviet program, uh, and I I
know there are a few people who are
experts. I've spoken to a few of them.
I'd love to hear from anyone who knows
anything about this Soviet program who
might be able to help us piece together
this mystery. And the best thing to do
would be to go to the
engineeringinfinitibook.com
website that Jean's put together and and
look at the paperwork that's there for
the manuscript that uh uh Valera has put
together and and see whether there are
any names that might be associated with
that work because it would be great,
wouldn't it, to get corroboration of
your father's secret work.
>> This is why Jean put it out there again,
right? Uh he's a genius. the genius.
Sorry, he's put it together,
>> right? We we put it out for the world to
decide. And uh my belief again whatever
you believe in is finding the people who
will find it interesting who will find
it applicable to what they are doing cuz
so far we have been getting feedback and
I can't name the organization that uh
one particular part of that solved an
issue they haven't been able to solve
for a bunch of years.
So that's already promising uh because
again as I mentioned in the beginning we
didn't know whether it was again just
something he made up or whether it's
something he actually observed right
>> and this feedback we have started
getting means that there is valuable
stuff inside so that's why
>> yeah and that's why we released it in
the way we did because
>> you know I I was trying to thinking well
do I write a story about it and just so
And and I'm like, listen, we, you know,
we don't have the expertise to do that.
>> So, let's do the best we can on a
translation and put it out there with
the invitation. Um, and you know, and I
appreciate that that that call out.
>> Yes.
>> Um because that's what I hoped would
happen. I said, "Somebody somewhere may
recognize this, whether it's work their
father or grandfather did, whether it's
something they worked on." Um, you know,
I didn't have particularly much hope of
it going too deep into uh into Russia or
or or Kazakhstan, but we're we're
certainly getting hits. Um, and and like
with anything, somebody out there will
recognize or know something that, you
know, everything's another piece to the
puzzle.
So Natalyia hinted there that there are
agencies presumably three-letter
agencies somewhere in the US government
that have taken a close interest in the
manuscript. What are you able to tell
me, Gene, of what they've aduced from
what they've read? I mean, Natalya
hinted there that there were things that
were actually potentially quite useful
to their understanding of what the
Soviets were up to.
>> Well, so it wasn't a three-letter
agency. It was actually a civil a
private uh company that studies
>> uh advanced propulsion.
>> Yeah, we just can't name the company
unfortunately. Yes,
>> no worries.
>> So, you know, not only there was another
author as well who was doing his own
research on UFO engineering and sent me
a bunch of materials after he he went
through the book and he said, I think
this is a the craft that's famously
related to Kapinar
um in in in the you know, former Soviet
Union.
>> Wow. So,
Just before it before before our
audience lose that capustiny is a very
famous name in the former Soviet Union
that's that's a secret wasn't it a
rocket launch facility
>> correct so it's all part with the prizer
capar are all sort of part of the same
network of facilities um that sit from
like approximately St. Petersburg and
then with when it was the former Soviet
Union into Kazakhstan
around um uh there's a lake that begins
with a
>> B. No.
>> Well, Bonor, the cosmic. No, no, the
lake. No.
>> Oh, yeah. Yeah. Bal, thank you.
>> Which has which has, by the way, one of
the most amazing um entity
>> uh alien sightings. There's an amazing
story about Lake by Cow, but I won't get
into that right now. It's it's all the
same neighborhood relatively. Um where
and and as well as you know those
facilities are at least publicly very
well known for their their uh missile
research ICBM explosives uh as well as
the UFO lore. But you know obviously on
the surface it's uh supposed to be
>> I was leaked uh I was leaked a document
from inside American uh defense not a
classified document I hasten to add uh
which talked about Mount Yementar. Have
you ever heard of Mount Yementar?
>> I have. Yeah.
>> You know better the subject matter
aspect. I don't I don't know the whole
story, but I know there was a there was
a suspected base of or or alien portal
or base or uh uh NHI that were spotted
in the mountains. It's sort of part of
the local legend.
>> Yeah. It's also allegedly the location
for a secret Russian military facility
where they're allegedly working with
recovered non-human technology. I'm just
wondering if that name came up in um
Valeris's documents at all. Mount
Yamantar.
No, he never, you know, he never
mentions anything specific as far as
locations. He never, you know, discusses
the origins of what it is that he's
working on.
>> The only the only clue that we have in
there, um, it was one of the first ones
that jumped out at me when it came to is
this official research of some kind.
There is a point where two times he
references previous work that he's
written and submitted to the Russian
Duma.
>> Wow. So this was going this was going to
the Russian parliament.
>> Yes.
>> Well the whoever was reading it. So
that's why I say you know he's he's
explaining to somebody else
>> in a portion of that document. He says,
you know, to the degree effect of um
reference this paper submitted to Duma
of Russia 1991 to 1997.
Um and though there so there's two
references like that which again says to
me whoever this is being written for
also has access to the previous papers
submitted to the Duma. And if we
contextualize once more,
you know, not everybody's walking into
the Duma asking for old papers and able
to get them. Now the really interesting
thing about this period of history with
the fall of the Soviet Union, the
collapse of the Soviet Union and in
those very early years in the 1990s,
there really was quite a lot of
collaboration between the United States
and scientists from the former Soviet
Union, not just in disarmament, getting
rid of some of the nuclear weapons,
>> but also on some of the scientific
programs that had taken place. And I I
sense there's still a lot of secrecy
even inside the US about just what the
Russians were up to, the Soviet Union
was up to because the I suspect the US
already knows a lot of what Valeris
Chernha's manuscript reveals. Is that
your impression?
>> I I I sus suspect so too. You know, like
I said, um this is a good time marker.
It's a good time stamp because not only
have I gone from the 80s to 2025,
I've looked backwards before the 1980s
as these these scientific domains
developed and and when did they take
hold and there's an interesting period
in particular I've just been sort of
diving into over the last week or so um
that involves a period post Roswell
through the 1970s
And in the 1970s, you have programs
um that that were endorsed by the US,
you know, came per the order of Nixon
>> where we have um US contractors
working in the USSR
on magneto hydrodnamic energy.
>> Exactly. I I wonder sometimes whether
there isn't one of the explanations for
the secrecy that that you know a lot of
people say to me why hasn't Putin gone
public with what he knows about NHI. I
suspect there is or has been
collaboration between the former Soviet
Union and the United States and I
suspect it's still ongoing believe it or
not.
>> No, absolutely. You know, when when I
looked at the the thread three documents
and those orders that established this
organization, that that said something
to me that the Russians looked at the
the UFO problem as an external problem,
as a true unknown, anomalous phenomena.
Mhm.
>> They knew it was not the United States,
but we took a different approach where
we had these programs developed and used
the cover of ICBM and we don't know
where it's coming from. Could be the
Russians, could be the Chinese, could be
the Russians seem to definitively know
it wasn't their enemy. So I think a lot
of the things the institutions and
actions that the US government took in
using the USSR even now Russia as the
enemy uh that we don't know what their
technology might be uh is specifically
designed that way. It's easy to bury
under the national security umbrella. Uh
there are obviously even right in my
father-in-law's design nuclear
components throw that under DOE the
compartmentalization
plus the decades of this happening um
where where institutional memory of the
origins has has has faded and the
science has just taken on a life of its
own. you know, it provides that perfect
environment. And and my my bringing this
out isn't to risk any of that, but to
say if we are serious about disclosure,
if our legislators are serious about
disclosure,
this is actually a road map to get there
that gives you specific parameters and
and guide rails to operate within. and
you can filter out the true national
security things and focus on the things
that answer the questions that humanity
is looking for. Have you had any
interest at all, any approaches from any
government agencies in response to what
you've put up online?
>> I had the FBI show up one weekend.
>> Interesting.
I uh they uh you know I call it more of
a fishing expedition than anything
direct. Um during the period of time I
noticed a lot of um let's say
intelligence community adjacent
uh analytics all from the the back
office of website and social media and
and and things like that. Um, you know,
again,
I have sort of have the background to to
understand some of this. I have a
Russian bride who has a master's degree
in IT engineering. We know, you know,
how to look at the back office and see
where traffic is coming from and and how
it's all uh
>> interconnected. What you're talking
about here is you're seeing ISP
addresses that appear to have
intelligence community connections.
They are adjacent to areas where there
is a presence and a concentration of IC
and and advanced aerospace
agencies
and the the numbers at which those hits
come relative to the other traffic
is disproportionate to what it would be
for a casual user. And they want you to
know that they are watching because
otherwise they would use the VPN
obviously, right? Because I think you
had even one hit from Vatican.
>> Yeah, I have one hit every now and then
from Vatican City which I've been told
is a friend.
>> So um Natalia, can I can I ask Natalyia,
was your dad disappointed as an ardent
communist? Was he disappointed that his
beautiful daughter had had uh gone over
to the American side or do you get the
feeling that when he sent this bundle of
documents it was largely out of a sense
of desperation he wanted them? I believe
you are correct in terms of desperation
cuz I think he felt himself neglected.
this how I feel about what and why has
happened after uh what was the reason
behind all that and honestly I think
maybe he knew about the Ukrainian
invasion and I don't think he would
support that among us cuz he was a very
uh he was about the peace about not
having any wars right so this is what I
assume from his perspective he thought
that would be better for me instead of
going to Russia cuz that's another fact
of my biography. So when I turned 16 I
believe I had to choose citizenship cuz
my mother she is a Latman citizen father
is was a Russian citizen. So I had to
choose and already back then I could
choose Russian right but I never did it.
And what I remember now very clearly my
dad approved the choice of Latan
citizenship.
So this still keeps on
circling in my mind whether he knew what
would happen because what's happening
now in Latia it's not something he would
want me to be part of right and in
Russia as well right so that's why I
feel a little bit that he could read the
future not being that crazy yet but this
this I remember correctly yeah very very
clear he didn't because I was expecting
he would blow
>> blow up right and just why did you take
Latan citizen. But no, he was very
supportive of this choice
>> and I'm a treasured dad's love anyway.
>> But you're a you're a dastardly
American. So to tell me this, Jean, um
where do you want to go with this? Like
what's your aspiration with these
documents? You've got this amazing
manuscript that really does I mean it he
talks about the UFO in a way that
suggests very strongly he had access to
a craft. We can't say definitively, but
what what I do find interesting is you
accurately point out in your analysis
that that whatever this document is
recording, what's interesting is the
Americans appear to be monitoring the
same technology and adopting counter
measures to it as well. Uh explain that
to me. Explain what you've described
there and what you've seen there.
>> Right. So along with you know did they
did they explore the same issues and um
you know have found yes not only they
explore it there there are actually
contracts out now in the SAM system the
government contracting system that I
could answer I could submit an answer
and a proposal on to these contracts
from DARPA based solely upon my
father-in-law's work and probably have a
good chance of winning the contracts.
Um the other aspect of what I did was to
to ask myself the question and and part
of coming forward was I also hear what's
coming out of Russia. Putin specifically
saying we are pursuing weapons using new
physical principles. They talk about EMP
plasmabased weapons. all of these things
which all echo and have hallmarks and in
some ways mirror the the derivatives and
types of technology that are that are in
my father-in-law's work and and so I
sort of asked myself the question in
trying to assess the US position and US
policy on this because it's either we we
know in their friendly we don't know um
what the intentions are or we know there
are potentially bad intentions.
And so I asked so research the question
if we take this craft and look at how it
operates, do we have any systems that
can counter how this craft operates?
And I not only found there were there
were about seven specific programs that
would specifically counter and cause
this dis be able to disrupt this type of
craft. But I also began to see a pattern
around some of the old um US nuclear
facilities
where there was manipulation of the
environment of the of the ground. Um,
and as we all know, you've done this ser
spots on it, the the relationship of
interest of UFOs to the um nuclear
>> to nuclear facilities. And I'm looking
at one case right now at a deactivated
uh site that used to have nukes where
people have found
large parts of the the the the
landscape, let's say, manipulated.
And my my hypothesis is did the military
recognize this
uh early on that these craft operate by
manipulating magnetic fields and did
they intentionally
also
did the the the government manipulate
the landscape around these areas? Wow.
in order to try and dampen the the
optimization of the craft as a way to
make them not able to operate in those
areas. So, it seems yes, very much there
are systems in place to counter at least
the type of craft that's described in my
father-in-law's work. Now, you you've
had people who do have physics
qualifications, advanced physics
qualifications, and engineering
qualifications look at these blueprints,
these schematics. I'm particularly
interested, for example, in some of the
detail from Chernah's design. For
example, he has a complete fusion
reactor specification using a so-called
chlorine lithium 6 to helium 4 reaction.
And you point out it's chosen
specifically because it produces no
neutrons or beta radiation, which is
perfect for spacecraft. To your
knowledge, is there anyone that you know
from science who says that things like
this are even technically feasible? I
mean, people can write things down in a
notebook, schematics, but are they
actually scientifically achievable? I
know fusion, we're very close to fusion
at the moment in science, but we're not
quite there yet. Is there anybody that
you've spoken to who said that any of
these schematics, any of these
engineering drawings are in fact
reflecting solid science?
So, I've had a number of of
people with physics background who have
come forward and and I it's it's been a
consistent reaction. They come in sort
of very confident
um and after a while they step back and
they say, you know, this is this is
really dense. This is really, you know,
this is more than I thought it was going
to be. It's it's much deeper. Um I've we
I've had feedback in the sense that
somebody who is again a nuclear
physicist looked at it and said you know
this is something with with $40 million
we could build the facility that would
be needed to build the tools to test
this. Um so for the ones who really take
the time now I've had plenty just
dismiss it. That's, you know, that's the
the the common reaction. But I've had
enough of the people who have dove into
it and spent time in it who come back
with that. Wow, this is really dense.
And you know, yeah, I think
maybe
>> I think the thing that really struck me
is that when you went through what
ChunahV described in his notebooks, for
every exotic capability that he
describes, you point out there's a
corresponding US defensive capability
that's either being developed or is
being developed. And for example um uh
transmedium vehicles that operate
through air, water and space. And it
looks like Arrow is very focused on that
as well. Electronic warfare,
electromagnetic propulsion requiring
precise field control and the US
response is electromagnetic
environmental effects program with a
sophisticated radio frequency
interference capability. Directed energy
weapons. Um the Chennah documents talk
about plasma containment and
electromagnetic field systems and you
point out that even in the open source
there's US research talking about
high-powered electromagnetic pulse
weapons and directed energy research. It
it's interesting isn't it that the US is
quietly working on much of what
Chennahay was talking about.
>> Isn't Isn't there an old saying Ross?
The best place to hide something's right
out in the open.
Absolutely. No, it's it's frustrating
though because in the notebooks, and
Natalyia, I think you'd concur on this,
in any of these notebooks, they're all
your dad's writing. It's not there's no
Soviet documents, government documents.
He's been careful not to piler or
include documents in his
>> correct. And there is also a method how
he classifies uh the papers. And Jin can
talk more about that because I did I I
was clueless, right? That was another
indication that this uh so my dad was
connected with uh certain institutions
in uh back in your s didn't explain the
whole classification of the papers based
on the colors and
>> sorry I'm like I'm making what I what I
say is um in in again trying to
>> trying to trying to authenticate um and
and
>> kind of you know give myself the the
idea and the parameter of of where this
fell in you know looked very carefully
at the structures of the papers. So the
way he uses headings and and and the
numbering systems and all of that is
again very consistent with what was done
during the time period in both uh
government and and academic work. One of
the interesting things was the very
first piece of paper is a pinkish red
piece of paper and that was something
that was used within the classification
system because the the the security
folks didn't necessarily know by subject
what was classified and what wasn't. So
they would use a a cover sheet that had
a specific color and if they knew if it
was coordinated with a badge or with
your position, they knew it was okay for
you to have that. And you know that was
somewhat validated again by George Knap
when he talked about, you know, how do
you get him out of the country? Well, he
just took off the top piece of paper and
threw it away.
So you think the pink paper which is a
blank piece of pink paper that that's
indicative that this notebook was a
sensitive document.
Absolutely. And and if you'll notice
some of the some of the pages are are uh
bluish there. The entire page is blue
ink which indicates that the it is a
carbon copy. We all remember you were
probably close to being gentlemen of the
same time period
>> when carbon paper reigned. Um so the who
knows where the original went. Um you
know when we speak in terms of the
thread 3 documents I'm sure this is one
piece of a much much larger piece of
work body of a body of work. I'm sure a
lot more came out of thread three than
this. It's interesting because I I I was
I only realized this week because I I
sent a colleague I think 25 pages from
the thread free documents that have been
made public from what George Tabd in
Congress. But George has confirmed to me
and to other people that in fact the
documents that he brought to Congress
and tabled involved several hundred
pages of documents and at the moment not
all of those pages have been tabled
before Congress which I find concerning
and fascinating. I I mean George
obviously tabled them with the intention
of making them public. I'd certainly
like to see the full extent of the
documents and make a comparison between
them and what Valerius Chernahva himself
wrote in his notebook. Um gosh, there's
more questions than answers here, aren't
there? There's there's a lot more
digging to be done.
>> Oh, absolutely. you know, and and early
on in this process, I mean, again, we
had a a full four years of of sitting on
this, of investigating and and
throughout then and even up until last
month.
>> Um, there is nothing in the world I
would love more than to have a a 20 30
minute conversation with George. Um, you
know, I know he he has the documents.
I've sent them to him several times.
Um, and you know to to again I was I was
hoping to do it before the idea even the
idea of releasing them came forward. Um,
you know I reached out to universities.
You'd be surprised how hard it is to
find a, you know, Russian-speaking
physicist, uh, who understands
cosmology and everything else as well,
right here, you know, in the in the
Boston area,
>> which is supposed to be very easy,
right?
>> Yeah. My full intent, those four years I
spent trying to find somebody to hand
these to.
>> Yes. You didn't want to even run with
that. You didn't want to dig.
>> No. I I mean, you know, this is the
thing. And it's only it it's the the the
contradiction
of people who we did meet who could give
an informed opinion on them to some
degree. Um whether it was on the
language, on the science, on the subject
matter itself of, you know, what was
going on in the, you know, UAP
community. None of this I had awareness
of prior to prior to really June of this
year. Um, even even you, Ross, I didn't
know who you were until June of this
year.
>> I didn't know who George Nap was until I
found a very funny video or which I
filmed from the TV back in 2021. It was
George Nap showing a video back from
Leware. I was 1950 something and I just
filmed it because it was Lew. I had no
idea it was George Nap. I swear.
>> No idea. So, you know, so the idea, you
know, he was somebody that seemed to
have hundreds of pages of these
documents and I could say, well, you
know, here's what I've got. You know,
what do you think? Or, you know, you
know where to send these or what to do
with these.
Nobody would know I exist. But that
never happened.
I got the feeling in a lot of ways,
not just George, but a number of people
were going out of their way to not have
a conversation with me about any of
this. And
again, from my old world and my old
background, that just makes me ask more
questions.
And we are where we are now. Well, I
hope somebody watching this is going to
come forward with a useful tidbit of
information. And Natalyia, I can't help
but wonder whether your dad in
desperation
sent these documents to your young
teenage son in the hope that one day he
might build the very craft that he
describes in those schematics and do the
breakthrough as a young aerospace
engineer that he wasn't able to do under
the disintegrating Soviet Union. It's a
beautiful story, fascinating story, and
I I I thank both of you for bringing it
to me. And I sincerely hope that if
anyone out there has any information
that might help us shed more light on
Valera's Chenn Hoyova's manuscripts and
the threadfree documents, we would love
to hear more about what was going on in
Soviet era UAP retrieval and reverse
engineering programs. Jean Stiko and
Natalyia Chahva Stiko. Thank you so
much.
