Good day and welcome back to Reality
Check. I'm of course your host Ross
Kulart and today we've got a continuing
feature in our story about the
Rendlessham Forest incident of December
1980. Those of us who watch Reality
Check frequently will know we've been
giving some attention to this vexing and
intriguing UAP mystery from way back in
the 1980s. The Rendlessham Forest
incident dubbed Britain's Roswell
occurred over several nights in late
December 1980 near the RAF, the Royal
Air Force Bentwaters and Woodbridge
bases in Suffk, England. They were US
Air Force bases during the Cold War.
Multiple US Air Force personnel reported
seeing unexplained lights in the forest
with some claiming encounters with craft
and even entities. This event involved
nuclear weapons storage at the base and
it added to speculation of a cover up or
national security implications.
Some of the key evidence includes
Lieutenant Lieutenant Colonel Charles
Halt's January 1981 memo entitled
Unexplained Lights, which was eventually
provided to the media by the British
authorities. It was his report of what
he'd witnessed in the forest. There's
also an audio tape from the
investigation, which has also become
public, which has gone into UAP law. It
shows Colonel Halt breathlessly
revealing what he's seeing with his team
as he's walking through the forest. Now,
skeptics of course have said that the
sightings were just misidentifications
of the Orford Nest Lighthouse, a meteor,
bright stars such as Sirius or natural
phenomena like rabbits scraping for
ground marks. But Colonel Halt is
particularly peeved with our most recent
interview with Larry Warren, who's a
controversial witness in the Rendlessham
story. And in order to provide Colonel
Halt with an opportunity to respond,
he's joining us today. I first
interviewed Chuck Halt in 2009.
It's lovely to have you back, Colonel.
Welcome to Reality Check.
>> Well, thank you. My pleasure to be here.
So sir, obviously you've seen the
interview that we did with Larry Warren
and Larry Warren describes being in the
forest on the same evening as you. And
if if that's correct, that means that he
was there on the evening of the 27th
going into the 28th of December, 1980.
He claims that you were there in the
forest on the evening that he saw a
craft and entities, beings of some kind.
What is your response, sir?
>> That Larry Warren was not there that
night very clearly.
>> So, tell me what you believe is the case
with Larry Warren. Was he ever in the
forest at all?
>> No. In fact, I talked to his girlfriend,
Cookie Vaughn, was her nickname after
the incident, and she said he was in the
dormatory drinking at a party that
night. He was very upset the fact that
he missed the whole event, so to speak.
>> Now, the reason why we decided to air
Larry Warren's claims last uh week is
because his claim is supported uh by two
witnesses. Uh, one of them appeared on
the program with Larry, a guy called
Steve Longero. Are you saying that
Steve's fabricating as well?
>> I don't know what you know what
motivated him, but I can tell you that's
let's start from the start with it. He's
on Clight. The security police had four
flights, four different groups of people
that rotated shifts. They would work for
three nights on midnights, three nights
on days, three nights on, you know, and
then after the nine nine day cycle, they
would get a three-day break. C flight,
which he steer was on Steve flight. He
definitely said he was there and he
probably was at Bentwaters and he was in
the WSA assigned there. For starters,
once you're assigned in the WSA, you do
not go anywhere else on your flight. You
do not do anything except your assigned
position there.
>> So, so just to explain to our audience,
Colonel, WSA is the weapons storage
area.
>> Weapons storage area
>> and I know
>> a very secure area that had exchange
badges and sensors and fences and all
sorts of interesting things.
>> I know you can't comment, but there was
almost certainly nuclear weapons in the
weapons storage area. So,
>> well, I don't talk about that. So,
>> yeah,
>> you can draw your own conclusion.
>> Sure.
>> It's even been said that believe that
Steve Longero at all left the Raph
Bentwaters weapon storage area that
night at all.
>> He couldn't leave the area. He was not
He would have been awol and he couldn't
have gotten out. There's no way he could
have gotten out of there until the end
of the shift. But let me explain. Sea
Flight finished their tour seen
Burrows and Cabanasac
and several you know all their
compadres. They went on break the next
day for three days. So he would not even
been on duty for three days.
Sea flight was gone. They were at home
at Burrows was on sea flight. Burrows
came out the night and was out there,
but he hitchhiked a ride back out to the
base. He was not on duty.
>> So he couldn't have been on duty. Let's
just explain to our audience because one
thing I've learned with Rendlessham is
it is infernally complicated because
we're talking about multiple nights,
multiple events alleged and multiple
people. So the the first evening where
something unusual or anomalous occurred
that in that included Penniston Burrows
and Cabanac
>> Cabanac correct. They went into the
forest to investigate strange lights and
in the course of their time in their for
in the forest cabana was sort of
intermediary halfway into the forest.
Penniston and Burrows went on further
and they came across what I think
Penniston particularly describes as a
craft and he's given an extremely
detailed account of coming across a
craft in the forest. Do do you dispute
anything about Penniston or Burrows or
Cabanisag's accounts?
>> The only thing I can say about that is
I'm not really I have problems with some
of the things they've said that changed
their story. Uh
I I do know that they had an encounter.
They did witness something. There was
obviously lights multiple people saw the
lights of you know from the east gate.
What happened was John Burrows was on
patrol at Bent Woodard's base. He went
up to check the integrity of the back
gate because it was occasionally left
unlocked. He saw lights in the forest.
He came back and called the desk
sergeant. The desk sergeant immediately
called air traffic control and everybody
you can think of to try and verify
dawned aircraft or whatever.
Penniston was in the dining hall having
midnight chow. He was called out as the
area supervisor for security at
Woodbridge base. He arrived with Air
Cabanosac. Airman Cabanosac was new to
the base. So he was riding with
Pennistan to be familiarized himself
with the base. They all gathered at the
gate and they looked and there's
definitely something in the forest. So
it's decided somebody will go out and
Pennison says I'll go and he asked Bud
Stefins, one of the other cops to go
with him. And Bud Stefins says I don't
feel good about this. I don't want to
go. And John Burrows volunteered. So
Pennisonson took Cabanasac who was
riding with him and they took a jeep.
They went out the East Gate Road, turned
right, went about a hundred yards,
turned left down a ruddy trail, not a
road, a ruddy trail into the forest.
They got so far and they hit a burm and
they were having problems with the
radios. So Penniston left Cabanac at the
vehicle or near the vehicle to act as a
radio relay, which is quite common to
do. and he and Burroughs confronted
something and I really don't know what
happened because they told different
stories at different times.
>> So that was on the first night. Now we
know that there was there were other
incidents but I want to get to the
evening of the 27th into the 28th of
December which is when um reportedly you
went out into the forest.
>> Yes. Three nights and I went out what
would we consider the third night. It
was a sat a Saturday night.
And what happened? Take me through I I
know you and I have done this before,
but take me through what happened on
that night. How did you
>> You want me to start before the forest
or in the forest?
>> Yes. Yes, sir. Tell me about how you
were approached in the miss.
>> Okay. We were having a a year in get
together for all the officers in the
combat support group at the Woody Bar.
It's an extension of the officers club.
World War World War II fighter club they
called it. We had just finished dinner
and getting ready for dessert when Bruce
England, the onduty flight lieutenant,
came in white as a sheet. Now, Bruce was
not a typical lieutenant. Bruce had been
in the Marine Corps for three or four
years. Got out, got a degree, came into
the Air Force. So, he was seasoned
person. He wasn't some flighty guy that
got excited about nothing. And he came
in and he approached me and he said,
"It's back. We need to talk." So the
base commander and I went into the cloak
room which was the only private little
room there except the bathrooms and he
explained that they saw lights in the
forest. They went out and there was
something out there in a forest. So it
was decided that I would go out. Conrad
the base commander had to give a speech
and do some presentations. So I said to
Mel Ziggler, the security police
commander, I'm going to go home and
change clothes and put on a utility
uniform. My fatigues come by and pick me
up in a little bit. We'll go out there
and we'll put this thing to rest and get
it over with once and for all.
>> Can I ask you this, Chuck? When he said
it's back, that implies that you had
prior knowledge of whatever these
objects were. What were you aware of?
Had there been a report made to you and
the base commander prior?
>> No. What had happened the first night
that Kenisonson, Burrows, and Cabanac
went out? I come in to pick up the
police blotters in the morning around
6:00 in the morning somewhere around
there. And when I walked in the door of
the police office, the death sergeant
started to laugh. And I said, 'What's so
funny? He said, 'Brows, Pennis, and
Cabanisack were out in the woods chasing
UFOs all night and the lieutenant said,
don't put anything in the police
plotter. I said, what? I thought he was
joking at first. I said, tell me what
you know. He said, "Well," and he
explained around midnight, he got a call
from Burrow at the East Gate that they
thought they saw a dawned aircraft and
they went out to investigate and they
came across something and that some the
death sergeant didn't know too much more
than that. I said, "Well, put something
in the blotter about there were some
unexplained lights or something out
there and I picked up the blotters. I
took them up to the office and we all
had a chuckle, you know, UFOs." We all
thought it was funny. We didn't really
take it too seriously, but I was aware
there was something was going on. So
that's why I knew there was something
happened.
Can I also ask Chuck at this point, one
of the claims that's been made by
multiple witnesses is that in the days
prior to these events, there was a large
cargo aircraft that arrived, a military
cargo aircraft that arrived and was
deployed to a remote part of the tarmac,
which is immediately adjacent to the
Rendlessham forest. Um, it was
apparently put there in the days prior
to this incident. Not a lot of people
know a lot about it, but people who are
aware of the tarmac having to be
strengthened have told me that um they
knew that this aircraft was located in
this area in the days prior. And there's
been some speculation that this is in
some way connected to what we're talking
about. Are you aware of this strange and
unusual cargo aircraft? I think it might
have been a C5
being located.
>> Yes, it was a C5. What was unusual? was
it arrived I believe on Monday. Now keep
in mind the incidents happened over the
weekend. I as I remember the plane
arrived on Monday. It did not land at
Bentwaters which was normal for cargo
aircraft especially C5s because we had a
special C5 pad and that's where the
transit facilities were. The plane
landed at Woodbridge and taxied off onto
a somewhat secluded pad.
And the interesting thing is the crew
wore uniforms, blue uniforms without any
markings on them. And normally when a C5
or a transit aircraft comes in, if it
needs security, for instance, if it's
the ABCC command post aircraft or
anything, we provided security. In this
particular case, they provided their own
security.
what I thought at the time and have it
was a DOE, Department of Energy, people
doing a special inspection or something
because they didn't tell us anything. I
didn't know anything about it except it
was there.
>> Can I ask you, sir, that's very
significant to me because the DOE
features a lot in covert alleged
retrievalss. People wearing DOE jackets
were seen in the Jonathan Wigant case in
Peru. Why do you think it was DOE? Is it
speculation on your part or did you see
evidence suggesting it?
>> Just speculation. Why else would
somebody come in with a strange crew and
provide their own security? That was
very unusual.
>> Why would they wear no insignia? I
thought it was a requirement of the
military code that all uniformed men
wear wear insignia.
>> It wasn't my place to ask questions
because I was obviously they were doing
something very classified.
Is it true, by the way, that this remote
area of the tarmac at Woodbridge was the
area immediately adjacent to the forest?
>> I don't remember which pad it was on to
be honest with you. I just know it was
the Woodbridge and I saw it over there
and I asked some questions to some of
the cops why you weren't providing
security and they said we were told what
they were doing their own.
And did you see any of the activity of
what these people in this particular
part of the tarmac were doing during
that time that they were there?
>> Didn't see anything they were doing. I
don't know what they were doing.
>> Were they there when the Rendlessham
incident went down?
>> No, they arrived afterwards.
>> They arrived afterwards. So it was not
>> they arrived I I believe they arrived on
Monday, possibly Tuesday.
>> And the event
>> the incident happened Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday.
>> Yeah. Okay. So that's interesting. So
definitely wasn't prior to the
Rendlessham Forest incident that began
on the Thursday.
>> Okay.
>> So thanks Chuck. I'll keep on going. So
what happens? You decide to go and
investigate.
>> So I went home and changed clothes and
Bruce England the lieutenant police
lieutenant came by with Bobby Ball,
Master Sergeant Ball. We picked up uh
Sergeant Neville's disaster
preparedness. I'd had already asked to
have him to join us. I asked him to
bring a Derkiner on a camera. He had a
Nikon F2 and I told him put some
high-speed film. He put Trix, which is
high-speed black and white film. And we
all bundled into the Jeep. We went over
into the motorpool to get gas because
the gas was low in the Jeep. And there
were lightalls there and a couple cops
were arguing with the fuel attendant.
And I said, "Come on, pack it in. We
want gas. I want to go. I want to get
back to the party."
So we went over across the base at the
back gate and down into the forest. And
when I got out into the forest, I was
shocked. There were four or five
vehicles, two or three light alls, and
probably 15 maybe few or more or less
cops milling around. And the first thing
I thought is this is a public relations
disaster. If we get caught out in the
middle of the forest in the middle of
the night like this with all this stuff,
we'll never live it down and never hear
the end of it. So I told the cops to be
quiet.
So Bruce England says I want to show you
where this thing landed two nights
before said okay. So Bobby Ball Nevilles
myself and he picked up Adrien Bastenza.
Now Bastenza had apparently gone back to
the base to bring up lightalls or
something and had just back arrived
back. So Bastenza came with me along
with the other three. He never left my
side till we left the forest except on
one occasion and we'll talk about that
in a couple of minutes.
They take me up to the site you where
this supposed landing happened and they
show me the indentations and while we're
milling around taking readings, we're
getting radiation readings. Not
dangerous, but just enough that there's
way way way way beyond the background
radiation.
The area in the center of the triangle
formed by the three indentations has a
much higher reading than the outside
edges do. And when we take the geer
counter against the trees, the side of
the tree toward the landing site reads
much higher than the back side of the
tree. And I'm thinking, "This is weird.
How am I ever going to explain this?"
And while we're milling around trying to
figure out what to do, somebody said,
"What's that?" We see out in the forest.
We look out into the farmer's field
between us and the farmer's house. We
can see a glowing orange object. I'd say
about the size of a large beach ball,
maybe a little larger. It's oval, not
completely round. It has a dark center
and it appears like it's almost like
it's winking and it's shedding sparks or
some kind of molten metal or something.
And I'm saying, "What is this? I'm
seeing ball lightning." The first thing
I thought,
well, it wasn't ball lightning. It
stayed in the field for a little while.
We watched it came into the forest. It
actually came in. Yeah.
>> Can I ask you sir, the farmer's field as
you refer to it, is that what we
understand to be called capable green,
cappell green?
>> Well, I don't know where capital green
starts and stops, but the farmers field
was directly in front of us between us
and the farmer's house. Now this is
significant because
the events that Larry Warren purports to
describe and indeed he is supported in
this by Steve Longero and I think also
by um I think you used the word the name
Bastenza um Mr. Bastenza.
Multiple witnesses say another event
took place on Capel Green at the same
time on the same evening, possibly
involving the same object.
Um,
is it possible I'm just exploring
possibilities here, just devils
advocating, doing my job. Is it possible
that contemporaneously at the same time
as you were in the forest with this
group of people, another group of people
were witnessing what was transpiring on
the green near the near the farmer's
house? Well, for starters, when I
arrived at what I call the assembly area
where the lightalls were and all the
vehicles, I told everybody to stay
there, not to leave, and to be very
quiet and cut out radio communication
because people could hear it or overhear
it. A lot of people have scanners, and I
didn't want to publicity.
Bastenza stayed at my side the whole
time I was in the forest. The only time
he left my side is when we were ready to
come back. We came back to the assembly
area and John Burrows had showed up. He
hitchhiked out from Switch. He was not
on duty. He said, "I want to go forward
and look again at that site." I said,
"All right." And he said, "I'll take
Bastenza with me." The two of them that
just the two of them went forward and I
could see them the whole time. Now, I
wasn't watching them the whole time.
They may have had an encounter. They
came back and did not say anything. They
saw anything unusual or they, you know,
no comments. We went back to the base
later. Bastenza and Burrows said they
had an encounter with something, but
they never mentioned Larry Warren was
not with them. There was just the two of
them and they were never more than 100
yards away and we could see through the
forest.
>> No, I understand that. I'm I'm just
exploring one one of the sayings in my
line of work, Chuck. We actually use
another line more vulgar is we always
assume a screw-up before a conspiracy.
So, I'm trying to find my way between
the two accountants of Larry Warren and
yourself to see if it's possible that,
you know, nobody's lying. It's just that
you were in different parts of the
forest that night. Um, is it possible
that where Bastenza and John Burrows
went was close enough to the green, the
capable green area, the farmer's house
area, uh, that they saw what was going
down on the green. Well, Kemple Green is
a large area. It's not just one little
place. It was the whole area out in
front of where we were, which included
the farmer's house. So, is it possible
though that something was going down? I
mean, God forbid American soldiers do
occasionally disobey the orders of a
senior officer such as yourself. There's
all these men in the forest. We know
that. Is it possible that they disobeyed
you and saw lights or something
happening on the green and went and had
a look and so that that encounter
happened independently of you you doing
what you were doing in the forest? I'm
just wondering whether
>> I'm just wondering whether it's a
possibility there.
>> All I can say is I didn't see anybody
else. I could see them the whole time,
but I wasn't watching the whole time.
Yeah, it did cross my mind though when
you described this large group of
security police who were in the forest
with the light halls and the and the
jeeps.
It it's possible, isn't it, that what
transpired was in the course of packing
up and moving back to the base, they
maybe stretched things a little and took
a peek at what was going down on the
farmer's green, the capable green area.
>> I can't comment. I don't know.
>> Sure. So, one of the things that is very
significant, Colonel, is you kept an
audio tape, didn't you, of what you were
seeing. Tell me.
>> I carried it all the time. I always
carried the tape with me.
>> You were narrating as you were watching
this object coming through the forest
like a big eye.
>> I was erasing.
>> Narrating. Sorry. Nar, you know, you
were speaking into the tape recorder. I
I didn't have spare batteries and I
didn't know how much tape I had. So, I
only turned it on whenever I saw
something was happening. That's why
there's a break, you know, continuous
breaks.
>> One thing I wanted to ask you about is
on that audio tape there is the sound of
sirens in the distance. And the
witnesses who say that they saw
something on Capable Green, including
Larry Warren, they say that British
police were in attendance on the Capable
Green. And when you listen to those
sirens, they are a distinctive British
siren noise. Wewah, wewah. That kind of
siren noise that is peculiarly English,
not American sirens. Are you aware of
that siren noise? that's on your audio
tape because a lot of people
>> No, I'm not.
>> I'm aware there's a bar of music on
there. My I was playing the tape for
somebody and the record button and the
play button were the same button.
>> My daughter was practicing piano when I
was playing the tape for somebody. a bar
of music
>> because a lot of people have focused on
those siren noises because there were
allegedly according to multiple
witnesses British police on the green
watching this craft that is described by
Larry Warren. And I think maybe at this
point I should just remind our audience
what it was that Mr. Warren says he saw.
He claims that he was present at Capable
Green, a field near the forest, which I
think is the farmer's field you're
describing. He saw a triangular craft 30
to 40 ft wide land. It emitted a glow.
Nonhuman entities 3 to 4 feet tall in
silver suits disembarked.
He says they interacted with the base
commander, Colonel Gordon Williams, not
you. There's been some
>> Gordon Williams is the wing commander,
not the base commander.
>> Right. Understood. Is Is there any
knowledge on your part that the base
commander, the wing commander, Gordon
Williams, was in the forest that night?
>> No. Let me explain. Gordon Williams's
staff car was a Chevrolet or excuse me,
a Ford Crown Vic. sort of like police
cars in those days. He Warren claims he
drove down into the forest and drove out
into the field. Well, for starters, you
couldn't have gone down into the forest
without a four-wheel drive high-c
centered vehicle. That's why we had the
Jeep. There's a burm you couldn't get
over without a tracked vehicle, and you
had to go through a barbwire fence. He
claims Williams drove out into the
field. Williams had a staff with them,
including Don Morland, the RAF leaison
officer. Don Mortyn was in Wales on
holiday. That's why my memo was two
weeks later and coming up. Don Morton
couldn't have been there. Gordon
Williams when I talked to him the
following morning, which I did, said he
was entertaining British guests at his
house. And I talked to his wife several
times and she said two cops came to the
door and told Williams what was going on
and he came back to the group of his
party at the house. He never went into
the forest.
>> Do you know if the British police came
into the forest? No, they did not. In
fact, I went to Suffach Constabularary,
who the chief was a friend of mine, and
had him pull all the logs for all the
events going to Bentwaters over that
time frame. And the only log they have,
two police officers, and the one
assigned to the base, came out into the
forest on the uh the morning after the
first incident. So, that would have been
the 28th.
And they were there. There's actually
pictures available of them in taking a
look at the site.
>> So, Colonel, one of the things you
described earlier was a Nikon F2 camera
with a roll of high-speed film on it.
Were photographs taken of the object
that you saw in the forest.
>> Yes, I was very familiar. I had an F F2
myself. I had two of them in fact a
series of lenses.
>> What What happened to those photographs?
Monroe Neville had his own dark room on
base housing. He had taken one of the
bedrooms and painted the walls flat
black caused all kinds of problems later
on with this other story.
He claims he developed the film and it
all came out fogged. Now, in my opinion,
the radiation we found on the site was
not enough to affect the film, but I
don't know. He could have made a mistake
in the dark room. It's easy to do.
Somebody could have messed with it. Who
knows?
Was there any interference at all before
he developed the film by any of the
agencies that were investigating this?
Were they aware that there had been a
camera in the forest? Is it
>> I don't think they were aware that he
had been out in the forest and taken
pictures.
>> So
>> he took pictures of the trees. He took
pictures of the ground, the
indentations. He took pictures he tried
to of the object. I don't know. I told
him you're not going to get much in, you
know, considering the situation.
>> Was he using a flash, sir, or just
high-speed film? No, just high-speed
film,
>> right?
>> You can push it pretty you can push it
the SA 78 900.
>> Now, one of the claims that Mr. Warren
also makes is that on the cable green
there were uh video cameras and film
cameras that there was a film camera
brought from the base from the base um
uh video office or film office. Are you
aware of any cameras being deployed that
way? There were no cameras present.
>> Were there cameras on the base? Was
there a film film set on the base?
>> I'm not even sure the base photo lab had
uh
I don't know. I know. I knew they had 35
millimeter cameras. I don't know that
they had video cameras.
>> Right. Okay.
Um
I just want to talk about Steve Longero.
He
He basically says
he he saw
um Warren in the forest and he also
corroborates this landing at Capable
Green.
You dispute Steve Longerero's account as
well.
>> Either his memor is faulty or Yes. I I
have no idea. I do know that Larry
Warren approached several people and
asked them to lie and say he was with
him and they were with him with with him
in the forest and they saw the UFO.
Steve Lume is one of them who confused
sent me an email and said he's lying.
He's lying. Obviously,
>> it's interesting because everybody seems
to disagree with each other in this
whole story. I noticed Adrien um
Bastenza, he supported Larry Warren's
presence in the forest at Capel Green as
well in some interviews.
Um
he he actually had a swipe at you
basically criticizing you for conspiracy
claims um describing those them as
embarrassing. Um let's talk about that.
I mean subsequent to these events, there
was an investigation, wasn't there?
There were personnel from elsewhere in
the US military that were brought in to
investigate the Rendlessham incident.
What can you tell me about what
transpired?
>> Well, I can only tell you what I have
secondhand from the parties that were
involved.
C flight who went out the first night
that's Pennison Burrow's cabana
were definitely taken in to the OSI
office definitely given how should I
harsh interrogation with drugs and
hypnosis Adrien Bastenza was also
treated to that
>> just I forgive me for interrupting
Colonel so OSI is the US Air Force
office of special investigations
it's it's an investigative agency inside
the US Air Force
Um, were OSI based at Rendlessham? Were
there people from OSI at Rendlessham who
were doing these
>> interrogations? We had five or six
agents. We had an office there.
>> And so were they the people who
administered the drugs that you
described?
>> No, they were not. According to the
people that told I told me so
brought there were people brought in.
There were people brought in from London
embassy perhaps or from the CIA and
obviously MA agency from British
intelligence.
>> Wh why do you say the British were
involved?
>> Because the guys that were interrogated
told me they had British pre presence
there.
>> And what was the nature of the invest of
the interrogation? Do you think that
they were being fairly questioned or do
you think that this was intended to
discourage them from continuing with
their allegations that they'd seen
something anomalous?
>> What I have to assume is that the number
one they wanted to know exactly what
happened. That's why they used sodium
penol, sodium emerol or something
comparable in the hypnosis. They also
wanted to control what was said. So
they're probably inducing screen
memories. I can tell you they screwed
Pennistan and Bastenza up something
terrible and they were never the same.
>> I mean, this is horrendous that US
servicemen were treated in this way and
indeed service women. I've I've spoken
as well to Lori Riffelt. Um, it it
shocks me that the US military would
behave like this to its own service
personnel. Why do you believe these
accounts? I mean, I'm I'm sorry to be
disputing the veracity of the people
involved, but you clearly accept that
there are multiple witnesses attesting
to the veracity of what they say
happened to them. You don't dispute that
they were given sodium pentathol and
aggressively interrogated.
>> I don't know that it was sodium
penithol. The OSI has a list of over 450
different drugs they can use to in
questioning people.
I know the OSI commander personally who
was there at the time, Chuck, that we
won't go into his name. I don't want to
embarrass him, but I asked him after the
incident, did they have any interest at
all in it? And he said, no. He said, we
don't have anything to do with that.
That's a bunch of nonsense.
>> So, he was lying.
>> Oh, of course.
>> Do you believe that John Burrow's uh
it's it's very much public record. I
know I actually spoke at one stage to
Senator John McCain before he passed and
he related the efforts that he'd made to
recover John Burrow's medical records
that showed that he was exposed to
something anomalous in the forest that
gave him injuries. Do you believe that
John did suffer injuries as a result of
his exposure to the object in the
forest?
>> I'm pretty well convinced. I also wrote
a two-page letter to the VA Veterans
Administration and John and Jim
Pennson's behalf explaining what
happened and there was a good probable
probability that that caused the
problem.
>> So obviously that was readily available.
>> Yeah, I'm skating across a lot of the
detail of the Rendlessham incident
because we've already run a lot of the
detail of your allegations about what
you saw that night and what everybody
else saw that night. I'm more interested
in the followup. Were you ever told by
anyone to shut up about this incident?
>> The only thing I was told after the
incident on Monday, I believe it was
Monday or Tuesday after the incident, I
talked with Williams and said, "Well,
what do I do?" And he said, he explained
to me what happened at the Third Air
Force when I took my tape and played it
for the general. And he said, "It's a
British affair." He said, "Get with Don
Morland and see what he wants to do."
So, I had to wait almost two weeks
because Don Morton was in Wales on
Christmas holiday. When he came back, I
went over and briefed him. Of course, he
went into shock.
And I said, "Well, what do you want to
do?" He said, "I don't know." He said,
"Give me something to talk from." So, I
wrote that infamous memo. It was only
for his eyes. It was not to go to mod.
It was not to go released. It was not
classified. It was just a here's what I
know and I kind of cleaned it up a
little bit and you know the rest of the
story except
>> it's a great it's a great memo, Chuck. I
I I have to admit um it's every
journalist's dream to find a memo like
that inside an archive. It it basically
>> you know how that came out, don't you?
>> Well, didn't the British authorities
release it?
>> Well, what happened was Mr. Warren went
back to the States and was running
around with his hair on fire talking to
everybody, anybody. and he ran into
several people,
Larry Faucet and Barry Greenwood who
wrote clear intent
and they came into Bentwaters with a
request from foyer request for any
information.
So we didn't have any we didn't keep
anything. Nobody we all wanted it to go
away. Nobody wanted anything to do with
it all the way up to the fourstar level
and I can talk about that a bit but
anyhow
we went back and said we don't have
anything. Well they went to third air
force. Next thing I know, Pete Ben, who
was the acting third air force
commander, called me on the phone. He
was a personal friend of mine. He said,
"Chuck, I've got this memo. I'm going to
have to release it under foyer." I said,
"Where did you get it?" He said, "I got
it from the liaison officer."
Apparently, Don Morland sent it copy to
his boss, the third air force, and they
provided it to the Air Force. The Air
Force, of course, of Third Air Force
released it, and you won't believe what
happened to me. ITV, German TV, BBC 1,
BBC 2, German TV, Japanese TV, radio,
Orwell. I had to go into hiding.
>> Australian TV, too, if you remember,
Chuck. [laughter]
>> I mean, the uh the the
>> I was fur I was fur I was I was furious.
>> Yeah.
>> Then Sam Morgan gave a copy of the tape
to Harry Harris and he sold it to the
Japanese who made it to it went public
there. So, so did I have a choice? I had
to talk. Look, I I I can I just say,
sir, I I deeply respect the fact that
you showed the courage and the decency
in backing the veracity of what you
assert in that memo. It would have been
very very easy for you to decline
comment. And I think um the public is
indebted to you for being open and being
prepared to be honest about what you say
you saw. I'm still trying to get to the
truth of what happened that night
because a lot of people
say to me there are multiple witnesses
to what took place on Capel Green. So in
order for Larry Warren to be a liar,
um
other people must be liars as well. And
I'm just considering the possibility
that unbeknownsted to you, while you
were in the forest that night, another
group of security police, including
Larry Warren, were in the Capable Green
area viewing what they allegedly say
they viewed on the green. And I
appreciate there are inconsistencies.
There are uh people alleged to be there
who weren't there. But is it possible
that that took place and went down
without your knowledge?
>> Well, we know for a fact that Don Morton
wasn't there. We know for a fact that
Gordon Williams wasn't there. Bastenza
was with me the whole time. So, how
could this have happened?
>> You tell me.
>> Why would these people fake a whole
story like this? I don't understand why
they would make this up.
>> Larry Warren is a very skillful
psychopath that can lie like you can't
believe. You need to follow his history
all the way back from Project Bullpen in
the States where he got involved in that
if you're familiar with it. Sports
memorabilia fraud. His fraud in England
where he sold John Lennon's glasses,
hat, and jacket. Where he sold Stevie
Bond's guitar, all fakes. his his fake
Bud Hopkins paintings. I mean, the list
is endless. I could give you a list of
people that have actually had them he
stayed and lived with them for a while
until they found out all that and just
went crazy. He's taken advantage of so
many people.
>> So, why would Langero support his
allegations that he was in the forest
that night at Capell Green?
>> Well, I don't know. We know that number
one, the first night Steve Lingger was
in the weapon storage area and Larry
Warren says he wasn't out there the
first night. So that rules that out. The
only night he could have been out there
was when I was there and he wasn't on
duty.
He was on safe flight. They were on
break.
>> Sure.
Can I ask you this more broadly,
Colonel?
Do you believe there was a cover up of
the events transpired in the forest over
those three nights?
I think Larry's been used as
disinformation. He's fit right in with
their scheme. Believe me, there's no
better way to make something ridiculous
than, you know, embellish it and make it
sound like some something really wild.
Larry got a Did you ever ask for his
discharge? He has a code of discharge.
It says he can never reinlist. He can
never work for the government. He can
never hold a security clearance. He was
booted out for unsuitable undesirable
Okay, I'm just going to come back now to
the C5 story. You're 100% sure, are you?
The C5 arrived after the incident
because some witnesses placed that
aircraft arriving prior to the incident.
It's possible, but I only remember
seeing it on Monday or Tuesday the
following week
>> because it's been suggested to me that
the C5 might have been part of a
psionics team. Uh, as you know, there
are allegations that that the United
States has been working with people who
have the capacity to in some way
telepathically engage with nonhuman
technology, non-human craft or entities.
And it's been suggested to me that this
might have been what's called a link
loss. That they were using psionics that
had come in on the C5 as an experiment
to operate these objects, these craft on
British soil. The whole thing was of
course shrouded in secrecy. Uh
we can't rule out that possibility. Does
the conduct of the authorities in
relation to all of this show any
inconsistency with that thesis? It
strikes me that there was from the
get-go an attempt firstly to find out
what went down in the forest that night
and what people saw. But then the next
reaction from the US military and
intelligence community was to shut it
down and to shut everybody up which
doesn't seem consistent with this being
something that the US didn't know about.
>> Quite possibly. The interesting thing is
the fourstar general commander US air
forces in Europe came to the base not
very long after the incident and I
learned years later that he was given a
copy of my memo and a copy of my tape.
The British were quite upset because
they they didn't receive a copy.
>> And did you have any opportunity to
speak to the fourstar general involved?
>> I did but he didn't ask me anything
about the incident and I certainly
didn't bring it up.
>> Right. The unusual thing, the unusual
thing is nobody ever approached me.
Nobody ever debriefed me. Nobody ever
said do this, don't do that. I got
promoted. Now in 1980, you have to
understand the environment. If you
reported a UFO, that was a killer. That
was, you know, was not career enhancing
at all. That was the end of it.
>> It didn't happen.
>> It did your career no harm. Which again
implies to me very strongly that the US
kind of knew what this was.
>> They definitely knew what it was. Gordon
Williams got involved after the fact. He
was not. He was aware of what happened
to the people with the interrogation.
when he was at California
several years later on a full on
assignment, the then chief of staff who'
been the fourstar in Europe at the time
and a good personal friend of his had
him go out and investigate an incident
that he claimed did something to his
health. Now on his deathbed he contacted
several people including James Fox and
he also contacted Sarah Krisky at a UFO
which is in the UK who was working on
Capell Green film or something and he
said he wanted to get in touch with me.
He had something on his deathbed he
wanted to say. Unfortunately he died
before he had a chance we had a chance
to talk to him but he did talk to his
kids. They contacted me and I contacted
them back and we made arrangements to
meet and they were going to tell me what
he said on his deathbed because he
wanted to make a confession.
They changed their mind. And then he
shut up.
So I pushed him hard and he said, "For
$10,000, I'll tell you the story. I'll
tell you what I learned." I said, "I
don't pay $10,000 for that. I'd like to
know, but I'm not going to pay you
$10,000." So, you've never been told to
shut up about it, but you do believe
that there was a an effort to stop these
people from there was an effort to
discredit the story.
>> Never.
Never. That's interesting. That's hard
to believe. I know, but it's true.
>> I mean, this
>> I'm not part of a conspiracy. I was
never ready on anything of, you know, as
far as a conspiracy and what they were
doing behind the scenes.
Are you aware of any allegations of any
film or video being taken anywhere by
anyone involving this incident?
>> No, none whatsoever. The only camera I
ever saw was the Anikon that Monroe
Neville was carrying.
>> Right.
And did you ever get the opportunity to
speak directly to the wing commander
Williams about whether he went into the
forest that night?
>> Yes. Well, I know when I ran into him
the following morning, the following
morning was Sunday morning. I came back
in home. I got home around 4:30, 5:00 in
the morning. I couldn't sleep. I was
took a shower cuz I was wet and muddy. I
got in a stream.
Decided [clears throat] to go in the
office and the office was a big quad hut
with a foyer in the center, the wing
commander's office on one side and our
office, the base commander on the other
side. And as I got to the front door, he
drove in. So I waited and opened the
door for him. And the first thing he
said to me was, "That was some night you
had last night." Because he overheard
all my conversations with the command
post when I was asking him to check with
the radar and do this and do that. And I
said, "I made a tape." He said, "Come on
in the office, play the tape." So I
played the tape for him. That was
Monday.
He [clears throat] said, "I'm going to
take it to the staff meeting, third Air
Force staff meeting on Wednesday." They
had a meeting every Wednesday morning.
And play the tape.
But did he specifically say that he'd
been at home that night? I mean, did he
say anything that was
>> He said he's entertaining.
I went to his his wake or his
celebration in life several years ago
when he passed away and his wife ex-wife
who his wife at the time March was there
and I knew her because she was a bit of
a problem on the base.
Believe me, she was a interesting
person.
So I said to her, "Do you remember that
night?" this very distinctly. She said,
"I remember those two cops coming and
Gordon wouldn't tell me anything about
what the cops told him." What had
happened is Conrad sent two cops over to
inform him because he didn't want to put
anything on the radio.
He wanted to know that I was not in the
forest.
>> So, you're 100% sure that he didn't go
with those police to somewhere in the
forest? Can you rule out?
>> Absolutely positive.
>> Right. Okay. [gasps] All right. So,
there we have it. I mean, we have all of
these inconsistencies in the Rendlessham
story. Let's talk about what we do know
for sure.
Do you believe that what you saw that
night was some kind of non-human
intelligence?
>> Definitely.
Whatever came into the forest that night
had to be unintelligently controlled. It
avoided the trees. It bombed up and down
and went around through the trees. When
we tried to approach it, it went back
out into the field and exploded.
Do you believe that the United States
was genuinely interested in trying to
investigate what happened that night?
>> Definitely.
Do you believe that sections of the US
military, notably the Air Force Office
of Special Investigations,
interrogated aggressively some of your
subordinates and used some kind of drugs
to compel them to reveal the full story?
>> Yes, but I don't think the OSI did it.
Experts came in from, like I say, CIA
and British intelligence.
Tennis distinctly remembers one of them
was a Navy commander in uniform.
>> A British Navy commander or or
>> No, American. American.
>> Do you remember the rank?
>> No, he said commander. That's all I
know. I didn't see.
>> Oh, sorry. So, it was it was actually
the commander rank. Okay.
>> Yeah.
>> And
>> that's equivalent lieutenant colonel.
>> Yes. Do you believe there's been an
active disinformation program and cover
up by sections of the US military and
intelligence community about Rendlessham
in the years?
>> Definitely. Definitely. And Larry
Warren's part of it,
maybe unknowingly.
>> He's been You believe he's been
unwittingly used?
>> Yes, definitely.
>> Okay.
>> Didn't take much to get him to be
[laughter] cooperate with.
I'm not going to buy into this blue, but
I'm fascinated by it because
fundamentally at the heart of all of
this, Colonel, we shouldn't get
distracted by the fact that something
anomalous did happen in the forest that
night.
>> Definitely. Now,
several people have told me and I I
believe them. There are incidents before
and after that that relate to this. In
fact, I did a program for unsolved
mysteries years ago. And at the end of
the program, they say, "If you have any
further information, call the fall
cosgrove mure at this number.
Hund and some people called in." And I
got some very interesting stories in
including some where some of the people
in the WSA actually shot at an object
years before. So, there's been previous
encounters involving anomalous objects
over what I will say were were the
nuclear weapons storage areas at the
base.
>> Oh, definitely. Two weeks after after
Williams and I kind of settled down and
still joked about it a little bit, he
said, "Next time something like that
happens, give me a call." Two weeks
later, Sergeant
security policeman called the desk and
said he was at Woodbridge base and he he
and his partner saw and were watching a
UFO. They called me, the desk called me,
I called Williams. We both raced over. I
beat him there because I could cut
across the base with my little TR8 and
he had to go around his big staff car.
We got there and it was gone. So, we
were very disappointed. We both went
back home and a day or two later they
told me it came back but they were
afraid to call me because they were so
disappointed and embarrassed that you
know it was gone whatever it was. Guy
Fox night the following year two cops
Woodbridge base saw a large cigar-
shaped object float over the base but
they reported later after the fact they
didn't want to be involved in it. They
told me all about it but a week or two
later.
>> Wow. So, there's been a concurrence of
incidents. There's been quite a a series
of incidents that have gone unreported
at Rendleship.
>> Oh, probably dozens. I'm just guessing.
>> Why?
>> There's something there's something
about that area. There's an attraction
of some type or a portal or some reason
that there people at the penal colony
and the people with the power station.
Okay, let's let me ask you about that
because there's a a colleague of mine, a
friend of mine, Simon Holland, who does
his own podcast and he speculated that
it's linked to tests that the British
were doing at different secret
facilities in and around the area. Is it
possible, do you think, that there was
some kind of weaponry being tested in
the area that might have explained all
of this? Well, John Burrows is firmly
convinced there's some type of testing
of high frequency pulse radar that may
have affected him. I don't know. I can't
comment. I don't have any knowledge of
it. I wouldn't rule it out. There's a
lot of stuff that went on in the base
that even the base commander and I
didn't know about.
We didn't have a need to know.
>> You know, it's funny. I don't know how
you guys in the military put up with
that kind of compartmentalization. I
wouldn't last five minutes in the
military because I'd always got to know
what was going on. [laughter]
If somebody tells me I'm not allowed to
know something, I immediately need to
know about it.
>> Sir, can I tell you something
interesting? Later in my career, when I
ran the DoD inspection director, we did
an organizational inspection DIA and
NSA. I went out on the inspection in
brief for the
NSA
and it didn't take me long to figure out
or my team chief to figure out that
every time you open the door there was
another door and you weren't going
through that second door that the
director of the NSA has no idea what all
they're doing.
>> It's so compartment.
>> I didn't realize I didn't realize you'd
worked as the DoD inspector general. Uh
so you work
>> the inspector all the teams work for me.
So this is really interesting because of
course the DoDIG, the Inspector General
of the of the Defense Force is one of
the bodies that's meant to be
oversighting the veracity of claims
about UFO incidents.
>> Um in in practice when you were doing
that job, it's quite clear from what
you're saying here that it's very easy
to snow the inspector's general. True.
When I did the unsolved mysteries
program, prior to doing it, I was still
on active duty. I was serving in in the
DODIG,
they approached me about doing the
program. So, I was a little reluctant.
So, I went to the DODIG himself and I
said, "Here's what happened. What do you
think?" And he sat down and listened to
everything. I ran him through. It took
about an hour. The whole everything I
knew. He said, "Do it." I went and did
it.
It's one thing I love about America is
that there is still a culture of
openness and transparency. But as you
say, there's always another door and if
they don't want you to go through that
door,
>> you don't
>> even in the inspector general of the
defense department, you'd never get
through it. True.
>> True.
>> Can I credential said I could go
anywhere, any place, in any facility.
That was not true.
Well, let me say I mean I I'm aware, for
example, of alleged deep underground
military bases in the United States that
may or may not be known to Congress. I
suspect they're not disclosed to
Congress, and I suspect they've been
kept secret from all of the oversight
agencies, including the DODIG.
If you turned up with the powers of the
DoDIG,
knocked on the door, and said, "I want
to come in." What would happen?
>> You wouldn't get in.
I can tell you two stories. One thing,
when I was at in in Belgium, I can talk
about this because it's open. We had a
facil a weapon storage area for our
intermediate missiles.
Same thing similar to what was at
Bentwaters. Three senior members on the
Senate Armed Services Committee showed
up on the base and wanted to go in the
weapon storage area. They didn't get in.
We tried to get them in. We could not
get the clearance to let them in. They
could not go in.
And why was that? What were they trying
to hide?
>> Nothing. Just the procedure is nobody
goes in without the following exchange
badge and so on and so forth being
perfectly vetted. I mean, you might be
aware that the um transparency
subcommittee of the oversight committee
in the house of Congress uh attempted
there were three members um uh of the
Congress who tried to get access to uh
pilots at an Air Force base in Florida
who were reporting anomalous objects
that they'd seen.
I think a lot of us have this
expectation that organizations,
institutions like the inspectors general
of the intelligence community, inspector
general of the defense department, that
you have these incredible powers. You
can kick any door in that you want.
I I don't understand what's going wrong
with oversight because clearly somebody
is covering something up inside the
military intelligence community in the
United States and even the bodies that
we entrust to do the oversight aren't
getting the access they need to do their
jobs. Do you agree?
>> 100%.
[sighs and gasps]
>> If you were asked, Colonel, I I
appreciate it's a long time ago now.
Gosh, what is that 45 years? If you were
asked, would you be prepared to give
evidence under oath in a public hearing
about what you witnessed at Wend
Wendles? Would you like to see
>> I've already volunteered to do that.
>> Would you like to see a full open public
accounting and transparency about what
took place that night? I mean, I'd like
to see subpoenas. I mean, I'd like to
see the Congress start.
It's not going to work.
>> Why not?
>> But okay, but let's put it to the test.
I mean, these congressional
subcommittees, they've got powers.
They've got subpoena powers. The
Congress is enshrined in the
Constitution of the United States as
having oversight over all sections of
executive government that it's paying
for. Why in hell's name is any arrogant,
hubristic military officer or
intelligence community official thinking
that it's above the accountability to
the Congress?
>> I can't answer that, but I can tell you
it's a fact.
We live in very dangerous times when
sections of the military and
intelligence community believe they're
above the law.
>> Now, there's obviously good reason for
secrecy, but sometimes it's overdone.
You're right.
>> Sure.
>> Well, Colonel, I don't think in this
conversation we've got to the bottom of
the Rendlesham mystery, but I've
certainly given you a good opportunity
to have your rebuttal to Larry Warren
and other witnesses.
>> I would suggest that they really weren't
interested. They need to talk to Peter
Robbins. They need to go to his website,
Peter Robbins P Peter Robbins NY New
York.com
and read his 58page
rebuttal to Larry.
>> So he's co-author of the book Left at
Eastgate. He he's the guy who wrote the
book with Larry Warren and he uh was
apparently upset with inaccuracies,
falsehoods in Larry Warren's story that
he discovered subsequently and he
withdrew the manuscript or he withdrew
his cooperation with the manuscript.
Correct.
>> That's correct.
>> Yeah. Well, I I I think we've tried to
shed more light on the render mystery.
One thing for sure I do want to thank
you for I want to thank you for your
service and I also want to thank you for
consistently through your career being
so willing to be transparent, open and
accountable about what you saw in the
forest in December of 1980. Colonel,
>> I always wish I'd seen the little green
man or whatever, but I didn't. I'm sorry
I have to disappoint you. [laughter]
>> Colonel Chuck, thank you so much for
talking to Reality Check. Best wishes to
you, sir.
>> You're quite welcome.
