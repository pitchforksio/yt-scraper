            "answer": "Great question, Alex. The UAP Disclosure Amendment, as proposed by Senator Schumer and others, is facing significant pushback from various defense and intelligence committees. The original amendment called for full disclosure of all government-held UAP information within a specific timeframe. However, what we're seeing now is a watered-down version that may not have the teeth the original amendment had. I remain cautiously optimistic, but there are powerful forces working against full transparency.",

            "answer": "Jennifer, that's a topic I've been investigating for years. I can tell you that sources have confirmed to me that aerospace contractors, including Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works division, have been involved in programs examining non-human technology. The challenge is getting official confirmation. What I can say is that multiple whistleblowers have come forward to the Intelligence Community Inspector General with information about these programs. David Grusch's testimony to Congress touched on this, and I believe we're just scratching the surface of what's really been happening.",
