We need your insight on the horrible
breaking news out of Australia of Nicole
Kidman and Keith Urban breaking up.
>> Look, it's very sad. We we were
devastated to hear this. Keith and uh
Nicole actually own a house about a
kilometer from where I'm sitting and
it's in the Southern Highlands uh just
south of Sydney. A beautiful big
rambling country house.
A lot of us in the area who know that
they live there and visit occasionally,
we respect their privacy and they've put
these gigantic earth berms around the
property so that um snappers
photographers can't sneak illicit shots
of them. And frankly, I feel so sorry
for them. I think the pressures of
public life are such that the intrusions
on their privacy and their time are such
that it must weigh on them and the kids.
