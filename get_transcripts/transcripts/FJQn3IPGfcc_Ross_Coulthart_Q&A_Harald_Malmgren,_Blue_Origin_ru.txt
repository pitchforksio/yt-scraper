Good day and welcome to that most
terrifying time of the week for me where
you get the chance to turn the
blowtorrch on your host. I'm Ross
Kulart. Welcome to Reality Check
Q&A. And to help me with this
excoriating examination, here's Megan
Orda. Good day, Megan. How are you,
Ross? I am great. Good morning to you
down in Australia. We want to start um
we want to get your thoughts on an
interview that was just released with
former presidential adviser Harold
Malmgrren. He sadly just passed away as
you know, but in this interview with
Jesse Michaels, he says, quote, I
directly handled UFO material. Can we
just get your reaction to what Harold
revealed? I'm so glad you've asked me
about this because I think this is one
of the most important interviews of
recent years. Harold Monggrren was a
great American. Picture this. You're a
27-year-old super clever guy. You get
hired into the White House to work for
JFK. The Cuban missile crisis breaks out
and you've got General Curtis Lame, the
head of the US Air Force, wanting to
launch nuclear missiles in a preemptive
attack on the Soviets. What do you do?
You get Harold Malgren to avert nuclear
war. That's what that that's what Robert
McNamara, the defense secretary did.
It's an amazing story. Harold worked in
the JFK White House and he went on to
work closely. In fact, his his CV is
absolutely extraordinary. Um he went on
to work for LBJ, Nixon, and Ford as a
presidential adviser. He also had a
personal relationship with Vladimir
Putin in Russia and he's advised every
Japanese prime minister since Tanaker in
the 70s. Gisgard Diston in France,
Pompyu.
Um the credentials of this guy are
extraordinary. And before I get into
what he actually said in the interview,
I just want to express my absolute grave
concern at the fact that someone in the
last 24 hours since Jesse Michael's
interview has gone up has started trying
to delete to nominate for deletion the
Wikipedia page of not only Harold
Malongren, a great American, but also
his daughter Pipper, who's also an
incredibly dedicated former public
servant, a very senior economist who
served in the Bush White House. For some
reason, someone has taken it upon
themselves to delete the two Wikipedia
entries of the Mongrren family. And
here's why.
In the interview that he did with Jesse
Michaels, Harold Mongren asserts that he
actually held material that had been
recovered from the Bluegill triple prime
thermonuclear bomb blast in the Pacific
in 1962 in his hands. It came out of the
plume of a nuclear bomb blast. And a
good friend of mine, Jeff Crookshank,
who's a friend of the Reality Check
show. He's been on the show a couple of
times. He did the work that showed there
was in fact a film available online from
the Department of Energy showing that
object, whatever it is, falling out of
the thermonuclear cloud at the time. And
what's quite incredible, I've been privy
to this for a while, well before um
sadly Harold passed in February. What
happened was I was talking to Pippa
Mongrren who came out to Australia and
she told me what her dad was saying and
how he was opening up about what he
learned about UFOs in the JFK White
House. How he was briefed by I think a
deputy director of operations for the
CIA called Richard Bissell into the fact
of the CIA's legacy UAP retrieval
program. Yes, that it was true. So you
had a very very authoritative American
public figure, somebody who's had the
credentials of an ambassador stating
categorically not only that he held UFO
material, but he was read into the
program in part by Richard Bissell from
the CIA, the director, I think he was
the deputy director of plans for the
CIA, the man who designed and built Area
51, Richard Bissell. And he also told um
I mean this is really important stuff
because you'll remember in the U David
Grush interview David Grush talked about
the 1933 Magenta UAP crash where the
Italian fascists recovered a craft that
was at one stage being looked at by the
the Nazis and then eventually secretly
covertly recovered by the CIA by the
Americans and taken to America in around
about
1944. Harold Mongren confirms that
story. He was told that story. This is
important stuff for the people who say
there are no witnesses who can give
evidence. This is why his evidence
matters. And it's obviously why someone
in the last 24 hours has taken upon
themselves to try and delete any
references to what Harold Mongrren has
revealed. In the worstc case scenario,
it's just those jocks who call
themselves the gorilla skeptics on
Wikipedia who are complete deniialists
and who go around excluding any
information that suggests there's any
credibility to the UAP story. In the
worst case scenario, it's an arm of the
defense or intelligence community trying
to exclude to censor what Harold Mongren
said from public knowledge. So all of
you out there, please go to Jesse
Michael's American Alchemy page on
YouTube and watch this incredible 3hour
I think it's 3 hours 18 minutes
interview. I'm still working through it.
It's such a huge thing. I haven't been
able to get through it all yet. But
every time I go back and watch it,
there's another aha moment where I go,
"Oh my god, it really is quite
extraordinary stuff." One thing to
finish, by the way, with with Harold, he
told Pipper, who's a good friend of
mine, in the last few hours of his life,
he told her that he was aware that there
had been UFO crash survivors, biologics,
recovered
from Roswell. And moreover, he had seen
a video of the sole surviving
extraterrestrial being from that crash.
that this is why somebody is trying to
delete this information. And what is
going on at the moment when one of the
supposedly most authoritative sources of
information on the web, Wikipedia, is
allowing itself to be produced by people
who call themselves guerilla skeptics
who basically go in and delete things
that are inconvenient to their
narrative, to their cause of events.
This matters. It's really important. I
think Congress needs to get into the
issue of who is censoring Wikipedia.
Thank you, Megan. Rent over. Thank you,
Russ. And we will link to that interview
that Jesse Michaels did for our viewers
if they want to see it to give him some
credit for our friend. Um, okay. Our
next question comes from loyal viewer
Nancy Coffin. Ross, this is in um about
the all female space flight that just
went up a few days ago. She wants to
know, "With all the buzz about the Blue
Origin space flight, what is your
opinion? Was it fake or real?" Oh, come
on. Of course it was real. You can't
fake a a space flight. I I don't buy the
whole fake space flights, fake Apollo
moon landings. People wake up. These
things happened. You know, the sooner we
stop denying science, the the sooner we
actually get on and start dealing with
the reality of UAPs. We can't let
pseudocientific claims creep into the uh
the narrative on UAPs. We have to stick
with science. The Bezos um origin space
flight happened. They did go into orbit.
It happened. So, by the way, did the
moon landings. And uh let's let's put
that to one side and get on with dealing
with reality.
Reality check, if you will, for us.
Thank you. Couldn't help myself. Okay,
here comes our next question from Josh.
Hi, Ross. There seems to be a narrative
shaping around the phenomenon and its
connection to the old gods of ancient
Egypt and Greece. With all the amazing
work you've done in this area and after
your recent trip to Giza, I'm curious.
Do you think there's anything to this
connection?
Well, look, it would be too speculative
for me to say that there's a definite
connection, but there's certainly, I
think, something in the fact that the
true story of ancient Egypt, as is
related by official history, doesn't
make any sense. I'm actually persuaded
and I've spoken to so many people about
this now that the pyramids, the Sphinx,
and a lot of the ruins that are cited as
being part of the pharaohic civilization
are in fact a hell of a lot older,
possibly tens of thousands or hundreds
of thousands of years old. I do think
that there is evidence of prior highly
advanced intelligent civilizations on
this planet that have never been
adequately explained. I'm actually going
to Peru, Bolivia, and Easter Island
later on this year to have a look at the
ruins there. And the megalithic ruins of
Egypt, the megalithic ruins of South
America, you can't explain them easily
without considering the possibility of a
prior civilization.
And is the evidence of that prior
civilization being suppressed for the
simple fact that a lot of archaeologists
just find it an inconvenient truth.
They'd rather not talk about it. How do
people explain the the water damage on
the Sphinx and the fact that the last
time there was water around the Sphinx,
I think, was between 10 and 12,000 years
ago. It doesn't fit into the official
narrative. Now, if UAPs were involved,
well, the suggestion would be that
perhaps it was some non-human
intelligence that was in charge of this
civilization. Uh, I have no idea. It
would be too speculative for me to go
there. But I do think that we shouldn't
embrace and just willy-nilly accept the
idea of a prior civilization, but we
should at least consider the possibility
because the facts don't fit with modern
archaeologies assertion about these
ruins. And far too much of what is known
or asserted about about pharaohic
pharaohic I can't even say it. I've
still got co about the ancient Egypt.
Far too much of it is is essentially not
adequately explained by modern
archaeology.
Okay, Ross, thank you. This next
question is coming from William
Murray6921. Why are these things always
landing in America? We don't hear of
aliens in Russia, India, China, etc.
They never seem to be consistent
sightings anywhere else. Why?
Okay. Well, there's an assumption there
that frankly is wrong. Those sightings
do happen all the time all around the
world. I commend to you, if you're
asking about Russia, I commend to you an
author by the name of Paul Stonehill.
He's written superb books about Russia.
Um, I think there's one called Russia,
the UFO Files, and he goes into great
detail about how the Soviets in the era
of the USSR did a 10-year study into the
UAP UFO mystery and they concluded that
whatever they were, they were real. And
Russian scientists have engaged with my
friend and colleague George Knapp early
in the days of Glasnost because we
before we all fell out. and George came
back from Russia with an extensive
compendium of files from the Soviet
investigations into UAPs. There are
numerous sightings of UAPs that have
occurred that are part of history that
are recorded. You only have to read the
books and look. One of the problems we
have with this whole subject matter is
there are priority assumptions that are
made by people. Oh, this only ever
happens in America. You know, these
things only ever happen in America. It's
only crazy Americans that see UFOs. Not
true. I mean, we know that there have
been UFO sightings like Rendlessham in
the United Kingdom. The UK's been pelted
with UFO sightings. But I here in
Australia, it's a huge issue in
Australia. That frankly, the reason why
it doesn't get as much coverage as the
US is because we have governments that
continue to deny any knowledge of the
UAP issue. they continue to suppress it.
Whereas creditably in America, at least
the government, the Pentagon has
formally admitted that UAPs are an
authentic mystery. That's the big
difference. And so there's, I think, a
willingness, a much greater willingness
in America for people to talk about it.
But I think that's changing. I think all
around the world there are sightings. If
you could only see my inbox, I get
literally tens of thousands of emails a
month from all over the world from
people telling me that they've seen
craft or luminous objects in the sky.
And it's not just the USA. It's an
international phenomenon and it does
seem to be drawn to sensitive military
facilities, particularly nuclear weapons
or nuclear power facilities.
Okay, great. Thank you, Russ. Let's go
to a question now from Carmen. She wants
to know, "It seems the main push for
disclosure of NHI is focused on the US
government. Why isn't there more
emphasis on other nations to disclose?
Don't they have programs too? France,
UK, Canada, and of course, your own home
country? Why is so much pressure on the
US? If any country disclosed, then that
would be enough, right?
Because the US is a beacon of democracy
in the free world." Well, that's the
official narrative. and and frankly I
think largely it's been true for much of
the last 60 or 70 years. A lot of the
leadership in the free world has come
from the United States. So it doesn't
surprise me that the if you like the
breakthrough the censorship of the cover
up that's occurred on the UAP issue
starts in America. But there have been I
commend to you again if you go to the UK
go into the public records or the
national archives office of the United
Kingdom and type in the Condine report
ci
um Dr. David Clark was able to obtain on
freedom of information that shows just
how seriously the British government
investigated UFOs. Then go across to
France and you have GAPA
Gean, which is a French quasi government
agency that investigates UAPs. Just
recently, I've forgotten his name, but
there was a French official who spoke
out publicly in an interview only in the
last couple of weeks, and he's indicated
very strongly that the French government
may be inclined to be much more
transparent about what it does know on
UAPs. And I do think that there is a
high likelihood that France or possibly
China might be more willing to be more
open about UAPs than the United States.
The US sadly is still locked into a kind
of a national security censorship
complex which is stopping it from
telling the public the truth. And my
biggest worry, frankly, is from talking
to so many people in the defense and
intelligence community in the US,
they're going to get scooped. they're
going to be left looking ridiculous
because I do think other governments in
the world are looking on at the US
waiting for it to show the lead. This is
an opportunity for President Trump to
actually show great initiative and to
show himself as a liberallyincclined
president in terms of freedom of
information to reveal to the public what
he does know and what his his colleagues
know in defense and intelligence. There
is no good reason why the public can't
know. That's generally conceded and
acknowledged by the majority of people
that I speak to in the United States.
And frankly, I think there's a good
chance that if the US doesn't s do it
soon, they're going to get
scooped. Okay, let's go to our next
question. This is from my um favorite
handle of the day at Big Daddy Magic.
Ross, thank you for the important work
you do and for how you do it. question.
Can you explain to us lay people the
persistently rumored link, if any,
between NHI interacting with this world
and demons? Why do religiously aligned
people seem to consistently warn against
interacting with NHI, warning it is
demonic? Is there an indication that the
NHI is the root of religion itself on
Earth?
I've had conversations with people in
the intelligence community and the US
Air Force particularly. There's a lot of
and I'm not condemning this. I'm just
saying it seems to be a fact. There is a
high level of evangelical Christian
belief at senior levels in the US Air
Force. And I've had a conversation with
somebody at a senior level in the US Air
Force who has flatly asserted to me that
we need to be extremely wary of engaging
with this phenomenon, the UAP issue,
because they say it is demonic. And in
his interview with me that he did for
NewsNation, Lou Alzando when he was
launching his book imminent, he talked
about how there is a huge problem with
resistance to transparency about the UAP
issue because some men in suits think
that you, the public, don't have the
right to know about this because it's
demonic. My personal view is e even if
something like demons do exist, what are
they? What essentially it's describing
is something that perhaps we don't
understand. It might be evil. It might
be malevolent. Why shouldn't we know
about it if it exists? So I don't
understand the argument. It's a
nonsequittor. It doesn't flow. A doesn't
follow B or B doesn't follow A. It
doesn't make sense to suppress something
just because somebody takes the view
that it's demonic, that it doesn't fit
with their religious beliefs. That's my
view. All right, Ross. Our next question
is coming in from David Ross. Please
give us your thoughts on what you think
about the Ashen Forbes assessment on the
missing MH370 claims. His investigations
seem to have credibility. Thanks for
your great work.
Okay, however I answer this, I know I'm
going to cop excoriating barbs from
Ashton Forbes, but here goes. So I think
10 weeks after MH370 disappeared in uh
March 2014, I was actually one of the
reporters covering the whole story at
the time. So I've got a pretty good
grasp of this whole story. But ma I
think MH370 went missing on 8th of March
2014. 10 weeks later, there's a guy
called Reicside Anon who posts online a
really intriguing video and it does look
initially very convincing and it shows
an aircraft that looks like the shape of
MH370 moving through clouds. Um, all of
a sudden it's surrounded by swirling
orbs and then it seems to disappear in a
big flash. And Ashton Forbes is a um uh
UAP researcher who has embraced this
video with relish and has made the
assertion that he thinks that there's
been a cover up of sensitive vision that
was leaked from a military satellite
showing this abduction by aliens of
MH370.
Now, I try and keep an open mind on most
things, and I've never really commented
on this before because frankly, Ashton
is a very aggressive person who doesn't
take kindly to people criticizing his
theory. But I really do think it is time
to give a response to this issue.
Firstly, I've spoken to somebody in the
National Geospatial Intelligence Agency
who tells me that the video that is
shown in that supposedly leaked video
bears no resemblance at all to the kind
of video telemetry that you get from
those satellites. It's not NGIA, NGIA or
indeed any other type of US government
satellite. But more importantly, and I I
think surely to God, this would kill the
issue stone dead if people looked at it.
There are videos of the clouds that were
taken from a photo bank, a known photo
bank, and they show very very clearly
that whatever the
um I'll just put it up on screen. So I
think the one on the left is the one
that's cited in the um MH 370 video and
promoted by Ashton Thorbs. And the one
on the right is from a photo video bank
and the guy who actually shot the
photograph for the photo video bank
which is essentially a raw archive of
images. The photographer has come
forward and said I shot that photograph.
That's my cloud. And all I know is that
when Ashton was asked about this and
asked to explain
uh the uh reasons why the clouds in the
supposed leaked video bear an identical
resemblance, not a resemblance, they're
identical to the ones from the photo
archive. He really didn't have an
adequate explanation. In fact, when
Denny Jones raised it with him on his
podcast, he gave Danny Jones a rather
purile explanation that um my butthole
looks like your butthole, which is quite
vulgar and really didn't answer the
question. So, I'm really sorry. I don't
agree at all that this is persuasive
evidence. And I think that Mick West to
his great credit the um skeptic I think
he calls himself Metabunk he wrote a
piece for the the skeptics which
basically went through in great detail
Mixer also a guy who's worked I think in
CGI and graphics and he's explained I
think very persuasively why he doubts
very very much that the MH370 video is
an authentic leaked government video.
But I know as I say this that I will
immediately become the victim of
excoriating attacks from Ashton Forbes
who is unbelievably aggressive. And I
have had maybe a hundred people
demanding that I embrace Ashton Forbes
theory hypothesis and give it the
credibility that all of them think it
deserves. I'm sorry. I don't think it
has credibility and I think that the
video is almost certainly a hoax and it
has never been properly explained why
the
uh images that are used in the video are
not just resembling resembling but
actually identical to images taken from
an archival photo archive.
Okay. I wasn't expecting to hear you say
um butthole today, so thank you for that
laugh. Uh one more Ross. Uh this is from
Ken Wood. Question for your next Q&A.
What is known about the alien species
evolved in the Brazilian varha UFO
incident? They don't seem to fall into
any of the existing categories, grays,
Nordics, reptilians, etc.
Well, funny you should ask. I actually
have on my desk a three-dimensional
rendering of the Fajinha uh alien which
um Tom and Shaborn Lon from Nima what is
it called again? Nima Creations I think
it is in the United Kingdom sent me. And
this is a three-dimensional rendering of
what two young girls described they saw
huddled against a wall in Vinha Brazil.
And it's also conforming to the shape of
whatever the entity was that was
witnessed by multiple people uh from the
Brazilian military and indeed at a
hospital in Vajinha in
Brazil. It does look demonic, dare I
suggest coming back to what we were
talking about just a few minutes ago. Um
and yes, you're right. Uh there are all
manner of alien entity shapes that have
been described by witnesses and this is
one of them. But if you look at it, it
doesn't bear too close a disresmblance
to the gray aliens. No discernable nose,
or if there is a nose, it's very flat.
Huge apparently black eyes, no ears, and
a tiny slit for a mouth.
Um, I would keep an eye out for my
friend James Fox's forthcoming
investigations into the Vajinhar uh
entity and I think also a good friend of
mine Ronnie Verete from Brazil has also
been taken a taking a very very close
interest in that subject. I don't think
we can exclude the possibility that the
Brazilian military and indeed members of
the medical staff at the local hospital
where this creature was allegedly taken,
I don't think we can discount their
claims that they saw some kind of
biological alien entity likely. Uh I
think we're going to be seeing some very
persuasive witness evidence very soon.
All right, Ross, that's all I've got for
you today. Oh, that's all over. Okay.
Okay. Well, I've probably aroused enough
controversy this week by talking about
buttholes and claiming
MH370, but uh let's uh let's get more of
your questions. If you'd like to ask me
a question, I try and answer as many of
them as possible, but we do get
thousands. It's reality check
atnewsnationow.com. And we love
answering your questions. It's actually
good for us to know what you want to
hear about. Thank you so much.
