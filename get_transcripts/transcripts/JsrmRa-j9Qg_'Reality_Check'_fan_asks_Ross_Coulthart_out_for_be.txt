Ask Ross if I can take him for a beer
next time he's in Melbourne. I promise I
won't ask him anything about UAPs.
>> Oh, bollocks. Of course you'd ask me
about UAPs. I'd love to talk about UAPs.
Um, you don't have to buy me a beer, but
I'm very happy to have a beer with you.
One of the gratifying things about doing
this story is when I was on uh 60
Minutes, quite often people would walk
up to me in airports and abuse me about
my latest story. They'd say, "Yeah,
mandrel, you got no idea what you're
talking about. You got it all wrong."
And the lovely thing about doing this
story is the level of positive public
feedback that I get frequently. I've
never I mean, it's actually quite weird.
I walk through any airport or public
space, I'm generally stopped by someone
saying how much they love the show, how
much they appreciate it. Uh when I was
in the United States in May, every
single airport that I went through, I
was stopped by people multiple times and
told how much they appreciated the Oh.
