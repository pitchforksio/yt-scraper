Um, I can tell you, I don't think I'm
giving anything away here. Uh, I can
tell you that, um, there is going to be
a video coming out, I hope, relatively
soon from our friends at uh, at
Skywatcher. Uh that's the uh Jake Barber
Alex Clous um privately funded group
that are investigating UAP phenomena and
trying to use psionic summoning and the
dog whistle to bring UAP objects craft
close in so that they can be videoed,
photographed and studied. Um they are
doing a study on psionics. Uh they've
spoken publicly about this in their
previous videos. I think they've done
interviews where they've talked about
the fact that they are going to be
studying telepathy and psionics and um
I'm really excited. I'm aware of some of
the work that they've been doing and I'm
really excited. I'm told they are in the
peer review process at the moment.
