All right. So, you're here today. Um,
you were just inside. You walked out.
Why?
>> I walked out because it it was it was
worthless. It was the biggest amateur
hour presentation I've ever seen about
anything. Okay. It was ridiculous. There
were no answers. Uh, every question that
was asked by the a member of the state
legislature, great questions, no
answers, no resolution. They don't know
where the drones are coming from. They
don't know who's doing it. They don't
know why they're doing it. But they say
there's no credible threat. It was
annoying to be there. I drove two hours
to be here today. Spent an hour in
there. I got to drive two hours back.
The biggest waste of five hours in my
entire life.
>> So, why do you think they called this
meeting?
>> I have no idea. Why would you call a
meeting to tell people you don't know
anything? I have no idea. And then when
the legislators would ask questions,
there were no answers. Here's the most
frustrating part. The Colonel of the
State Police said that he had a
helicopter of his flying over above one
of these drones, a six-foot drone or
something. I can't remember exactly what
he said. And he just he felt unsafe for
his helicopter. So he just let it go.
Just let it go. Where'd it go? Who
knows? You know, didn't want to follow
it cuz he didn't feel safe. That is that
not the most ridiculous thing you've
ever heard. I mean, honestly,
>> do they have any Do they have any idea
where these drones are originating?
>> No, they don't. They would. Maybe if
they follow that sucker when it landed,
they would know. But they don't. This is
This is a complete lack of effort in my
opinion on trying to figure this out.
This is not about ability. We have the
technology. We have the people. We have
the training. We have the resources. you
have the money. It's just a lack of
effort. I mean, they I don't know. I
don't know. They should be saying, you
know what they should have done today
with productive use of our time. If they
didn't know anything, come in there and
say, "Hey, legislators, we don't know
anything. But if you get us these 10
things, do these 10 things for us." And
the governor calls in this kind of
action, we can figure it out. Will you
help us? And then we would have helped
him. But instead, it was just excuse
after excuse and we know nothing. It was
infuriating. And I got up and I walked
out.
>> You've been in the service, right? Yeah,
I was an attack helicopter pilot, Apache
helicopter pilot in the army, and I
helped stand up the initial um uh
unmanned aircraft training battalion in
the aviation sector of the army. So, I
know a little bit about what I'm talking
about. And these guys are not doing the
job they need to do to figure out what's
going on. And that is the Department of
Homeland Security, the FBI, and the
State Police.
>> And they're saying no no threat to to
Americans.
>> They're saying no threat, but how the
hell do they know? They don't know
anything. They don't know what it is.
They don't know where it come from. They
don't know nothing. When I walked in
here today, I was actually pretty calm.
I was excited to be here to find out a
couple things. I thought they'd be like,
"Hey, listen. It's FedEx trying to
figure out." But instead, I got the most
ridiculous amateur hour briefing I've
ever sat through.
>> Wow, that's truly upsetting. All right,
thank you.
Hello and welcome to what's going to be
a very special twopart episode of
Reality Check investigating these quite
extraordinary so-called drone sightings
all across New Jersey. In fact, it's not
just across New Jersey. It's across the
entire continental United States, across
the United Kingdom at certain military
bases, and indeed, if what I'm hearing
from multiple people from all over the
world is right, Russia, China, New
Zealand, Australia, this is a worldwide
phenomenon. Something that the
authorities choose to call drones, I'm
more often going to call them objects,
are causing mischief across the planet.
I prefer to call this perhaps a series
called the drone debacle. Or could we
perhaps call it the defense department's
dithering failure to disclose what the
hell is really going on with so-called
drones over sensitive airspace and
packed civilian areas. We're now at a
point where we really do need to know
what the hell is going on. If this
wasn't a national security crisis
before, it sure as hell is now. As
you'll see on today's program and the
follow-up tomorrow, you're going to see
how the concern is ramping across the
United States. Mayers of New Jersey. 25
mayors have got together to express
their concern and we'll be hearing from
Mayor Sam Morris from Mine Hill Township
in New Jersey. In today's show, you're
also going to be hearing from our
correspondent Joe Khil in Washington DC
in Congress and we'll also be talking to
Merrick von Renenamp the correspondent
for the Hill. So, let's get into today's
program. Let's first bring up Joe Khil.
I'd like to bring Joe in because he's on
the ground in Congress. U there's a
hearing underway of the Homeland
Security Subcommittee that's
investigating or supposedly
optimistically investigating with the
title safeguarding the homeland from
unmanned aerial systems. Quite how any
assurance can be given at the moment
that the homeland is safe when we know
what we know, I do not know. But let's
bring Joe in and hear from him.
>> Joe, welcome. Uh can you please tell us
first what is the purpose of this
Homeland Security uh subcommittee
meeting today?
>> So you've got several military officials
today and the the goal of it is to sort
of talk about discuss explore the ways
in which the military can and should
respond to drones that are coming over
to the United States. Now, when we talk
about drones in this context with this
hearing, um it is all kinds of things.
Obviously, over in New Jersey right now,
we've got a situation where I'm being
told by senators uh that they don't know
what this is that's flying around. In
other cases, we do know what these
things are. And sometimes it's uh
Mexican drug cartels, sometimes it's
foreign adversaries. So, you've got all
different categories, but you're sort of
in one big uh one-felt swoop having this
hearing to decide and go over kind of
what are the more uh appropriate
responses when we have incursions on uh
American soil and in American airspace.
>> One thing, Joe, do we know definitively
that they have or haven't been able to
confirm that these objects are actually
drones? I mean, the spin coming from the
Pentagon and different intelligence
agencies is that these are foreign
adversary drones that that we're not
naming Russia or potentially China if it
is China because we don't want to
escalate already inflamed international
tensions. Are you buying that? What are
your sources telling you around the
halls of Congress? You know, I think
they use the word drone because anything
that's flying around that is obviously
not an airplane or a helicopter, they
refer to as a drone. So, if you look at
the technical definition, what people
are seeing right now in New Jersey may
or may not fit um depending on where
they are. What I'm hearing though is
that um I think there's a there's a
genuine frustration on on Capitol Hill
because there are several senators who
are in the committees of jurisdiction.
um people who are on Homeland Security
or are on the Armed Services Committee
who've told me that they have not been
given any kind of briefing um at all.
Now, others say they have. So, what that
tells me, which isn't totally uncommon,
is that there are pockets of senators,
potentially those in intelligence or or
what have you, um that are getting uh
general briefing and others that are not
that are left in the dark. Um which
again frustrates uh many of them. And
the ones who have gotten these are not
really talking much about it. They're
being pretty tight- lipped about what
they've heard.
>> I I know Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has
flagged that she's very keen to get
answers and she sits on the Senate
Intelligence Committee, a very
highpowered senator, and she's been
prominent in getting the establishment
of Arrow, the all domain anomaly
resolution office. Is anyone talking
UAPs, UFOs, Joe?
uh not out loud. No senator is is
bringing uh that aspect into the story.
Uh I've heard that from other sources
here on Capitol Hill that as they're
watching some of the videos that are
coming forward. Um some of the
characteristics that they have I've have
heard described fit more with the UAP
category than with uh the others. And
for instance, um uh there's a I don't
want to get too specific about my
sources, but um we'll just say generally
staff um talking to me about the noises
that are coming from or are not coming
from some of these videos where they're
seeing these things. And um in some
videos you hear like a almost like a
helicopter noise in the background and
for others you don't. And for the ones
where you don't, most of the drones that
we are aware of, maybe commercial ones
or or larger ones, right, you'd hear
that kind of thing. So, um I'm hearing
the conversation, but so far in up to
including Senator Gillibrand, at least
not yet. And I would love to talk to her
now. Uh no senator has brought that
forward as a possibility. But what I am
hearing from some senators is they're
openly saying that we don't know the
origin. Um, I've heard that from several
senators that it is not a known right
now where these things are coming from
and what their purpose is.
>> Now, that that in and of itself to me is
just gobsmackingly extraordinary, Joe. I
just for the life of me do not
understand how the United States with
all of the resources that it has to
monitor, track, and interdict objects
over sensitive airspace can't at least
follow these objects to their source
point. If they are solid drone objects
that are being maneuvered by a foreign
adversary power, do you find it
plausible that that we haven't in the
months of these issues been able to
track one of these objects back to
source?
>> You know, I think that uh there have
been several that have not been very
publicly reported about about um that
have been tracked back to source and
some of them have been adversaries uh
you know, which is concerning. I think
the bigger um sort of open question that
makes you scratch your head is um if we
were to actually know that these drones
h were from a a foreign adversary. Um it
is amazing that not one has even been
attempted to have been brought down um
by the United States military. Um,
granted, they're flying over in in many
of these cases residential areas. Um,
but having said that, we certainly have
the capability without shooting drones
down to bring drones down. I've heard
that from senators on the Armed Services
Committee that there are mechanisms to
do that. And so you would imagine that
um if this were a case like China or
Russia, you have to scratch your head as
to why we haven't done that even once
yet in the last week or so as these
things have been flying around, openly
flying around.
>> I I've actually been told by my own
intelligence sources that we have tried
and failed to bring these objects down
with standard counter UAS technology
that the technology just does not work
and we're perplexed. Yeah, we're we're
perplexed that we can't do it. One
thing, Joe, I wanted to ask you about
and it was just an intriguing thing. I I
know Americans love their football, but
why on earth is the National Football
League part of a Homeland Security
hearing into these drones? Do you have
any idea why?
>> You know, uh I should know the answer to
that and I don't at the moment, but by
the end of the day today as people are
watching this, I absolutely will know
the answer to that question. uh it's
just been a a hectic day running around
chasing senators. So, um immediately
when I can get back into that hearing,
that's going to be the first question I
ask.
>> I mean, I'm presuming it's something to
do with the fact that in the run-up to
Christmas and after Christmas, there's
going to be large crowd events playing
football. And I guess if there are
unknown drones flying overhead, you
don't want to have a large crowd event,
there's a possibility, I guess, that
some of these big football events could
be postponed or cancelled or interrupted
in some way because of these unexplained
disruptions over our guys,
>> you know? I mean, that's certainly
possible, right? And when when you have
such large amounts of money or big
high-profile events like the Super Bowl
that will be coming up eventually, uh
the last thing you want is a national
security threat hovering over. So that
certainly may be one reason they'd be
interested to hear and to influence how
uh the American response goes, you know,
when it comes to these things. That that
that would be the ultimate irony, Joe,
if after months of pushing for answers
on the drones, it's the footy players
and and the footy viewers who actually
force disclosure of what's really going
on.
>> Listen, you can you can take security,
you can take a liberty, but you're not
going to take football away from
America.
Of course, Ross, can I add one thing
that I thought was interesting is uh the
governor of New Jersey uh was asked
about why he doesn't have more
information yet. He said to reporters in
the last 24, 48 hours that he's been
talking to the White House and the
Department of Homeland Security and the
only information as to why we don't have
more intel on these is because in his
words here, I'm going to quote him. He
says, uh, they seem to be, uh, pretty
advanced and that when we put a
spotlight on them, they go dark. Uh,
which was a very interesting description
to me that, um, I I don't know that I
had ever heard that before about any of
the drone incursions that that we've
seen over the United States. So,
>> I saw I I I saw that comment, too, Joe,
and I I can tell you that that doesn't
sound like any known drone technology
we're aware of. If it is drones, it's
highly advanced technology. I'm sure
you'll get answers for us and u we'll be
looking forward to talking to you again.
Thanks very much.
>> And we're answering. We're asking him,
of course, Ross. Thank you.
>> Okay. I'm now going to bring in the
mayor of Mine Hill Township in Northern
New Jersey, Sam Morris. He's about an
hour's drive from uh downtown New York,
and he's got some very interesting
perspectives on the local concern.
demounting local concern in and around
New Jersey about these anomalous
objects. Welcome, Mr. Mayor. What can
you tell us? What's the latest coming
out of New Jersey? Are you still seeing
these objects?
>> Well, what the latest out of New Jersey,
and thank you for having me on, by the
way. Uh the latest in New Jersey is it's
uh ever spreading was wasolated a couple
of days ago to three or four counties in
North Jersey. New Jersey has 21 counties
um altogether and then and they're now
getting sightings in 21 counties. Um and
Staten Island, New York, is also
reporting a lot of overhead activity. I
noticed one of your um I noticed one of
your colleagues, Tony Perry, who's the
mayor of Middletown, New Jersey, just
just a few hours ago, he he said that
there were drones, unmanned drones,
reported
>> over not just Middletown, but also the
airspace over the naval air station,
weapon station Earl. And um I'm just
wondering whether you've got any weapons
or naval stations or weapon stations in
your area. Are you seeing any objects?
I'm I'm being careful not to call them
drones. Are you seeing any objects over
any sensitive military facilities in
your area?
>> Uh yeah, we are we are about 5 miles
from Pikatini Arsenal, which is a
weapons development center uh here in
North Jersey. We're an hour and a half
from uh what used to be called Fort
Dicks um Meguire Air Force Base. And
we're hearing that there are sight there
are sightings of these things over all
the bases. there's no um uh delineation
or respect for those boundaries
whatsoever.
>> Now, sir, obviously there's been very
careful statements, including
non-statements from the Pentagon on this
so far. I'm I'm incredulous to be
perfectly honest that there's been no
definitive statement from the Pentagon
one way or the other about what they can
tell us once and for all about these
objects. Does that concern you? Does it
concern you that we're just not getting
answers at the moment?
>> That is it. It's not only concerning,
it's the absolute crux of the problem.
Um I I I have a what what started all
this on Sunday was about 25 fellow
mayors of mine in Iowa County decided we
kind of were fed up with no answers. So
we issued a press release. Sunday
morning, we issued a letter to the
governor and legislators and federal
officials on Sunday evening and started
intentionally stirring this up strictly
over the fact that we're getting
nothing. Um, we understand as mayors, we
understand as elected officials, we're
not involved in police or military
operations. We understand that that they
we stay far away from those things
because uh for safety reasons, security
reasons, but to not at least let us know
that they know what is going on. Hey, we
know what's going on, you guys, and
you're going to have to trust us, but
this is not unknown to us. They are
essentially stating it's unknown to them
to the FAA, to the uh Homeland Security,
and to the Air Force and FBI are saying
we we don't know.
>> Well, that's where it's not acceptable.
>> That's a very grave situation. I don't
know if you're familiar with our show,
but for many months now, we've been
reporting anomalous objects appearing
over military installations in the
United States, but also overseas,
notably Langley Air Force Base in
Virginia and the Eglund Air Force Base
in Florida. And those events go back
many, many months. And the official line
consistently from any of the agencies
has been that these are drones that
we're led to believe that potentially
these are either um drones being
directed by some unfriendly actor from a
foreign adversary nation. But the the
consistent line has been that we know
that these are drones. Are you satisfied
on the basis of the answers or the
non-answers you're getting from any of
these agencies that they actually know
for sure that these are drones?
>> No, no one is. No elected officials that
I talk to uh you know they're they're
they're either colleagues or friends or
you know we we all know each other. We
try to work well with each other
regardless of party. None of us know
anything. And while we understand that
we have to have some faith, right? We
have to have some understanding that
that the people who should know these
things do know. They're saying they
don't. The FBI is has put out that they
don't they don't really know what's
going on. Um governor's office. Um and I
take the governor at his word that he
he's also very frustrated. Um so that is
what's disconcerting. If if I could
elaborate, what's what's upsetting the
average resident and and me personally
and others I know personally is there's
something over our heads physically,
right? And and these things don't weigh
5 ounces. They can weigh up to 300 lb.
And if they lost power and fell on us or
fell on your car windshield driving down
the road or fell on your house from 400
feet, it's coming through your roof,
it's coming through your car, it's
coming through your deck, it's going to
hit you and hurt you uh with good
probability. And yet we're being told we
really have no idea what's going on up
there, but they're supposed to know
what's going on up there. That's their
job.
>> And we we indeed spend an awful lot of
tax dollars on paying for national
security and national defense. And I
find it incredible, and we've been
commenting on this on the show for some
time, that despite the money that's been
paid, there's just absolutely no
assurance. The New York Governor, sorry,
the New Jersey Governor Murphy, he he
actually gave quite an interesting
description. He said, "The drones are
very sophisticated. The minute you get
eyes on them, they go dark." Now, that's
suggesting that these objects, whatever
they are, they are able to see what
people are doing on the ground and
respond and then hide themselves to
display stealth. Are you getting similar
reports yourself in your neighborhood?
>> Well, I I'm not I do know of that
statement, but I'll tell you that to
take that in a slightly different
direction. They I don't know why they're
going dark. They're not making any
secret that they're up there. I know
they don't want to be followed, but they
come out at 5:30. You know, an eastern
seabboard in the US is dark at 5:30 now
with daylight savings. And they make no
bones about the fact that here they all
come at 5:30. They're out till 10 or 11
p.m. and then they go away, right? So, I
don't know why they'd even go dark. They
they're they're incredibly obvious and
they're not trying to be hidden. If they
wanted to be hidden, they'd come out at
2 am. They would go through the sky dark
and we'd never know this. We'd all be in
the dark about this. we wouldn't know.
So, I don't even know why they're doing
that. Uh if that, you know, if they're
if that's what's accurate. Uh but I I do
know that there is they've what's
interesting it it started in primarily
Morris County, New Jersey, North Central
New Jersey, right? It's almost a
bullseye in the dead middle north. Now,
it's spread to 21 counties, but we're
not seeing less in North Jersey. We're
not seeing less in Morris County and the
count surrounding counties. We're seeing
a similar number, and now they've grown
in number in other areas. So that means
that they have a larger volume of these
things. So making up a number, let's say
over Mars County, New Jersey, there were
known to be 30. Well, there's still 30.
They're still the same number. There's
no diminishing of that. But yet there's
an expansion in other places. That's
that's disturbing. At least to us, it
is. One of the explanations that has
been offered by backgrounding to certain
journalists has been the explanation
that if we did engage these objects with
anti- drone technology or weaponry, we'd
risk damaging the people underneath or
damaging people and property underneath.
What What do you think of that
explanation?
>> Uh I there's I know a couple of guys who
are FAA licensed drone operators and
that is their big they've told me that's
your big fear. Um that you don't want to
you know the guys of course guys get
carried away. Oh, I'll shoot one out of
the sky or I'll run a drone into it. But
if they're large, they could hurt
someone. Um, yes, we know sometimes
they're over parks or farmland, and that
of course is ideal, but you know, we've
come up with the idea that they should
just follow them home even if they go
dark. So, we all know that the that the
military has tracking ability. You can
lock on a target and and you're locked
on. It doesn't mean you fire or do
anything, right? We've all seen the
movies. Well, that technology is real.
So, lock on one of these things and
follow it home. It may go dark, but it
can't escape that. And
>> so ahead,
>> the implication the implications though,
sir, are that they've tried doing that.
They've also tried counter drone
technology. And my sources are telling
me that those counter drone weapons are
not working against whatever these
objects are, which suggests that
whatever they are, albeit they're being
called drones, they're displaying
advanced capabilities that appear to be
demonstrating an imperviousness to the
kind of technology we would normally use
to disable them.
>> I you know, I I will say to you as an
elected official, I don't know any of
that to be accurate. I you know um but
if that if that's accurate then they
need to figure out a different way and
that may that may be tracking them and
bringing them down uh as safely as you
can.
>> Le let's explore the national security
implications here because you've
mentioned that you have Pikatini Arsenal
which is a weapons development center
close to your area. Um the um
uh New New Jersey Advance has reported
that there have been 11 confirmed
sightings of unauthorized drones flying
in the airspace over Pikatini Arsenal in
recent weeks. And and there were in fact
18 sightings, but they've been able to
confirm 11 incidents. And confirmed
means a police officer or security guard
has visibly witnessed a drone. And um
they've got seven unconfirmed reports of
drones, which means a police officer
received a call but was unable to
verify.
>> In by any measure, sir, 11 confirmed
sightings over what is one of the most
sensitive weapons facilities in that
part of North America is of grave
concern, isn't it?
>> Agreed. And that's what that's what has
people concerned uh beyond their own
personal safety. They yeah, we all know
that they are not there's a no-fly
boundary or zone and none of that's
being respected.
>> Now, there is there is a congressional
hearing that's happening uh right now. I
think it's the Department of Homeland
Security hearing safeguarding the
homeland from unmanned aerial systems.
Do you have much hope that there's going
to be anything coming out of that that's
going to give you an answer?
>> I don't want to speculate. I don't like
to speculate much, but no. I mean, I
think if they had a if they had a plan
or something they could do, they don't
really need a Congress. They they have
enough laws on there. They don't need
the Congress to say, "Well, we had a
hearing and we've come up with an idea,
go do it." The military and and Homeland
Security uh and the FF FAA are going to
do what they've got to do. They have the
authority now to do that. So, I don't
know if much is going to come out of
that um personally.
>> So, m Mr. Mayor, what what do you want
to see done? What would you like to see
done in your part of New Jersey?
>> Uh, well, I would like to see um if if
they I say I've suggested this idea if
they know what the what these things
are, if they actually do know, you know,
which of course the average person
thinks that they do. They think the
government knows everything. People
think I know all this, but if they do
actually know it, they need to put it
out through channels in a way to say,
"Hey, look, we can reassure you. We know
what it is, what these are, and what's
going on." if and that would there are
certain people in the communities in the
in the political and in this law
enforcement communities that can be
trusted and people would say okay we
believe you we have faith in you and
we'll buy into that people understand
national security I also understand you
know President-elect Trump President
Trump's lands at an uh personally lands
at an airport near you you're in Maran
airport and everybody thought well
that's okay we don't want him to get
hurt um but if they don't actually know
they need to just start finding Now um
and and yes unfortunately that may
require bringing some down that may be
require act various aggressive actions
on the part of government and the
military but they need to if they don't
know they need to know and yes there's
going to be some risk with that but
that's that may be the risk we have to
take.
>> I'll put to you one explanation that's
actually quite concerning that I've
received from an intelligence source.
The the explanation's been given to me
that this is Russia demonstrating a
capability to deploy drones over
sensitive US airspace and the US
allegedly reportedly doesn't want to
admit this publicly because to do so is
tantamount to accusing the Russians of
an act of war. And things being as
sensitive as they are at the moment, we
don't want to precipitate or escalate
the situation any more than we do
currently.
I I think if this were a foreign um
country, I think they would probably be
bragging about it.
>> And I think they'd probably be using the
same objects in the in Ukraine. One
would have thought I
>> Ukraine or North Korea, South Korea,
anywhere. I mean, but if I were if I
knowing what we do know about Vladimir
Putin, let's put let's go with your
inference there for a second. He's going
to be crowing about this. He's not going
to stay under he's gonna say, "Hey, look
what I just did to you." Right? and he
would take a lot of glee in that. Um, so
I yeah, that's that it's a stealth
operation from a foreign military is a
that's a stretch and let's hope it's
not. That's what we're it's one of our
fears.
>> Well, Mayor Sam Morris, we hope we can
help get you some answers, but thank you
so much for talking to Reality Check and
News Nation and we look forward to
talking to you again. Thank you.
>> Thank you so much.
Okay, I now want to bring in my friend
and colleague Merrick von Renenamp who's
a correspondent for the Hill. Marrick's
been monitoring the ongoing Department
of Homeland Security hearing which was
ostentatiously entitled and somewhat
optimistically entitled safeguarding the
homeland from unmanned aerial systems
which has just completed or we're
actually just coming up to the end of
that hearing. Merrick, what happened in
the hearing? Has there been, I hope,
explosions as as members of Congress
seek answers and try and get some
explanations for what these weird
objects are. Well, Ross, first of all,
thanks so much for having me back on.
Um, and I'll start off by this is a
truly bizarre story and seek series of
events. Um, bottom line from my read of
of that hearing is that the FBI
>> is utterly clueless about what is
occurring uh over the skies of New
Jersey and into New York. Um, there
there's one gentleman there from the
from the bureau, Mr. Wheeler, who's the
assistant director of their critical
incident response group. Um, literally,
you know, just had nothing to add. He's
he they say, "Hey, yes, we're we're
tracking. We're monitoring." But they
have no clue. He looked he looked a
little hesitant frankly. He was he was
measured but but he you know any
government official is going to be u
quite awkward when they can't explain
something such as this. Um and I'll just
quickly add um in the post 911 world I
find it shocking. It's egregious. It's
astounding that this is happening and
it's been going on for a month now. We
just learned today that the first
sightings were confirmed on November
13th over Pikatini Arsenal, which is a
military research facility that goes
back even a few few days earlier than um
that we do previously. This is this is
astounding that that nobody has any
answers.
>> Actually, it's earlier than that, isn't
it, Merrick? I mean, as you'd know,
we've been reporting on reality check
the weird so-called drone sightings over
Langley Air Force Base. I think you've
reported on that as well. And there's
also Eglund Air Force Base and multiple
other bases all across the continental
United States that have been seeing
anomalous objects which the Air Force
particularly and the Department of
Defense and Intelligence community have
been calling drones. This is a
historical problem, isn't it?
>> Very much so. Um, not only does it go
back several years, it goes back
decades. And um you know I've been
looking at some very fascinating old
government records that um I can just
think of one series of incidents that
Jay Ellen Heinik actually wrote about in
his book The UFO Experience. And there
there are some really astounding
government documents that um outline
exactly what we're seeing. Unknown
objects with blinking red, green, white
lights hovering, moving up and down
rapidly over nuclear missile silos um in
Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska. And oh
by the way, that exact same pattern and
series of events occurred in 2000 in
late 2019 and 2020. Um where hundreds
hundreds of people were seeing these
objects. Um
>> this is Oh gosh, I'm so pleased you
mentioned this. So this is the Colorado
swarms. Is that right? The Midwest
swarms.
>> Correct. This is this is really
interesting to me because I've needled
people in the intelligence community
about those so-called swarms which were
seen by police, by military, local TV
reporters, and everybody just goes, they
clam up. They won't talk about it. And I
I don't know why. I mean, the
interesting thing is you're saying that
the decades old J. Allen Heinik
sightings and the Colorado swarms,
they're they're not just similar to,
they're describing objects that are
identical to these objects.
>> The documents and and I got to give
credit to Robert Hastings who wrote the
seminal book on on the nexus between
UFOs and and nuclear weapons, nuclear
technology. These documents can be found
on his website, UFOhastings.com,
I believe. Astounding. They outline
1965. Again, the exact same kind of
flight characteristics, bright flashing
lights, hovering up and down movement.
Um, but I I want to quickly just drill
into something a fascinating connection
that that I think may tie these New
Jersey incidents to um uh the 2019 2020
Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming
incidents. And News Nation, our favorite
network, um had Mayor Sam Morris from
Minehill, New Jersey on just yesterday,
and he described
firsthand account. He saw this and
apparently he has video of this. I'd
love to get my hands on it. Um he
described one stationary object, drone,
whatever you want to call it, and other
four or five other objects that were uh
moving around it and he described it as
a methodical scanning pattern. Very
interesting. Right. So there there's
this one kind of mother ship, if you
want to use that word, um and then these
other drones moving around in concert or
in in a specific kind of trajectory
around it. Now, if you look back to
emails that um that have been released
through the Freedom of Information Act,
I'm going to quote directly. Um a Chase
County, Nebraska, this is from 2019
2020. A Chase County, Nebraska sheriff
deputy reported observing 30 to 50
flying independently of each other with
a larger quote mother ship hovering for
hours directly from the uh from the
memos, from the law enforcement memos.
We'll do one more just very quickly. Um,
in Kansas 2019 2020, a law enforcement
officer observed quote 10 to 15 drones
that flew all kinds of patterns around a
stationary drone. End quote. It flew
right over him. Uh, he had night vision
on, couldn't see it because of the
bright lights. Um, but quote, it made
absolutely no sound at all even though
the wind was calm. End quote. Um so that
that kind of that similar flight dynamic
that that pattern that we're seeing um
gives me at least moderate confidence
that the objects that we that were
observed in 2019 and 2020 are the same
if not similar to uh what we're seeing
in New Jersey now. Merrick, if the
senior FBI official who's just given
evidence to the Department of Homeland
Security hearing in Congress, Wheeler,
if he can't say what these objects are,
how do we even know that they're drones?
>> That's a great question. He he also I I
I will say that he he went on to discuss
in a in a a second line of questioning
from another member of Congress. He said
that um quote something to the effect of
credible credible police officers and
and other law enforcement individuals
had observed both rotary and fixedwing
objects. So that that gives you a sense
of these being drones of some kind based
on if we were to take him for at his
word which I think we probably should
but um there he has claimed that that
these have exhibited those those
technologies. I would say fixed wing is
that's pretty astounding that a fixed
wing aircraft is not we can't track
that. We don't know where that's going.
We don't know where it's coming from.
That's astounding. And I I don't want to
bury the lead here, but I I think maybe
the biggest revelation um from the
hearing just just now was that
Congressman Chris Smith from New Jersey
uh reported that a uh a a police officer
observed 5050
drones coming quote in off of the ocean
a few nights ago. Uh the Congressman
Smith was also in touch with the
commanding officer in the Coast Guard
and he described 12 to 30 of these
objects following a coast guard vessel
following the vessel out in the ocean.
So there might be a water and ocean.
>> That begs the question, Merrick, if it's
following a Coast Guard vessel, Coast
Guard vessels have radar, they have flu
imaging systems, they have counter UAS
technology, they can call in they can
call in air support. uh what the hell is
going on? What if you know if I mean one
of the scenarios that you and I as
journalists you you sometimes get a wink
wink nudge nudge tip and I've had a few
from intelligence people in the last few
days and they're all confidently
asserting that this is Russian
technology and that the Russians are
deploying drones from over the horizon
on container ships or vessels off the
horizon and that these are coming into
the east coast to cause mischief. If
that's true, why are we not being told,
do you believe, about the I mean, let's
assume that that's true. And I have to
admit, I'm skeptical. Why are we not
being told about that?
>> That is a I mean, you could run up and
down. Again, we're going into spec, you
know, speculation territory, and that's
a great question. I I don't know if if
if it is true, and I I have a hard time
buying it on its face right now. just
just if they're truly seeing fixed wing
aircraft, those are not going to be
flying off of container ships, right?
Unless they have an aircraft carrier
parked over there. So So um you know
gosh, I might I think I'm fighting the
premise here just because it I I haven't
seen any any evidence of that. I nothing
that I've seen points to that. Uh but go
ahead if you if you have something to
add. No, no. I just this is one thing I
wanted to ask you because as well as
being a journalist of good repute,
you've also worked in a national
security role, I think, with the State
Department,
>> right?
>> Let's let's be open-minded here for a
moment. There are occasions, especially
at times of heightened international
conflict. There are occasions when, for
good reason, governments don't reveal
all they know. They're often cautious
about escalating. We know that there's
been decisions made by the British and
the Americans to escalate the use of
weaponry, storm shadow missiles from the
UK, um at CAMS missiles from the United
States to allow them to be used on
Russian territory.
>> Add to that, there's been a series of
weird incidents. There's been an attack
by a Chinese ship with Russian crew
member uh on internet uh connections in
Scandinavian waters in the Baltic Sea.
Um there's another incident. There's a
Boeing satellite that inexplicably
exploded in orbit a few weeks ago. We
still have not had any official comment
about that, but sources are telling me
it was very, very unusual that a
satellite would just suddenly explode in
orbit.
I'm hearing that there's concern that if
the United States was to name the
foreign adversary power, if this is
true, that's allegedly involved in
deploying these drones. If this is true,
the the explanation is that they're
worried about escalating by naming that
power and by essentially accusing that
power of an act of war. There is some
logic to that if that's true, isn't
there? I
>> I agree. Um, but I I think the there
there is an enormous political risk if
that ends up being the case and the
American people find out that this was
being concealed from them. That would be
a colossal scandal, right? Anyway, you
if if that scenario is true, that is a
just an an extraordinary scandal. Um, so
yeah, I mean, look, your guess is as
good as mine. Um, sure, you could, you
know, the Russians have engaged in
what's called hybrid warfare. Um, they
have sabotage networks. I think to to
your point, Ross, there there was a
story
uh just a few weeks ago that that um
they were trying to take down cargo
aircraft with um with explosive devices.
A couple of those devices actually did
go off in cargo facilities. So um this
if this were in fact a a a Russian
psychological operation, um it it is an
except it's an a remarkable escalation
from from the deniable
um activities that we believe they have
been been doing. This is, you know, with
the bright flashing lights and the just
kind of the mass amounts of of these
craft. I mean, 50 aircraft or 20 to 30
coming off of the ocean. Um, that's
that's an an unbelievable escalation.
Merrick, you've been very prominent in
commenting on the growing
prepoundonderance of evidence to suggest
that possibility, the possibility that
the explanation for at least some of the
anomalous objects that have been seen
over the United States in the last 70 to
80 years is perhaps nonhuman.
Are we talking potentially that these
drones might in fact be a non-human
intelligence?
Boy, we're we're we're touching the
third rail here. Um, you know, it it's
it's tough to it it's it's tough to
assess, right? Because there are
consistent reports of rotors, fixed
wing, right, noises and and um
capabilities that appear consistent with
pretty standard human technology. Um,
>> but we do know I forgive, forgive me for
interrupting there, but you and I both
know about the phenomenon uh, in
scientific papers written by people like
Dr. Eric Davis, there's been
descriptions of what's called mimicry,
>> where the
NHI, if it is indeed NHI, the phenomenon
is able to imitate technology. the cash
lendroom incident uh where allegedly a
large number of helicopters were seen
and it could not possibly have been a
large number of helicopters. I mean, we
can't exclude the possibility, can we,
that these objects, which are being
called drones by the United States, at
least in background briefings to
journalists, can we exclude the
possibility, my friend, that this is in
fact some kind of mimicry by a non-human
intelligence? I don't think we can.
>> As of the last I'll tell you what,
before I started looking into this
topic, um, I would have easily excluded
many things. I can't exclude anything
these days. Um, right. I think all
options need to be on the table. And
just to your point about mimicry, um,
just very briefly, in 1975, there were
just these just unbelievable incursions
over nuclear um, facilities in the kind
of the northern tier of the United
States. Um, in some instances, the the
objects were quiet. And this is all in
in declassified documents. You can read
all about this. Um, the New York Times
wrote about it. Um, and the Washington
Post did a superb piece on this. It's
titled, "What were those mysterious
craft?" And I encourage all of your
listeners and viewers to to to read it.
It came out that came out in 1979 and
was about these 75 incidents. And um in
in one particularly notable instance, um
guards and officers at these nuclear
sites observed or heard what they
thought was a helicopter,
um but it hovered over the nuclear
weapon storage areas. And the the quote
in the government cable is that the this
helicopter had a quote clear intent on
the nuclear weapons storage areas. So
look, we can't we can't exclude mimicry.
Um, I will just say quickly, um, during
that string of events, there was, uh, at
least one incident in Malstrom Air Force
Base, which hosts a lot of nuclear
missile silos, where fighter jets were
sent out to intercept some of these
objects, and witnesses on the ground
observed the lights on these objects
going off as the jets closed. Um, and
then the lights went off,
>> which is exactly which is exactly that's
exactly, funnily enough, that's what New
Jersey Governor Murphy has reported.
>> There you go. Now you see connections
are building. Yeah, that's right. That's
right. Exactly. So, and and to your
point about the Russians doing this.
Look, it we we see that same mother ship
uh and kind of smaller objects moving.
We see that same dynamic in 2019 and
2020, which is well before um you know
the Ukrainian invasion of Russia. Were
the Russians over
Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming? If
again, these actors appear to be the
same just based on these these
characteristics and and they seem to be
consistent. So, boy, it's a hell of a
mystery. You know, I I think all we can
do, all I can do at this point is follow
the story and try to draw those linkages
if they if they do exist, if they're
reasonable. Let's get back to the
hearing. What was the reaction of the
politicians to that quite ridiculous
admission from Wheeler of the FBI?
>> I I was surprised. Yeah. And we're
dealing with New Jersey and and u you
know, Americans are familiar with New
Jerseys are a unique bunch. They they're
they're orary. Uh and I expected more
fireworks, frankly. I expected more um
uh anger and and you know and and
outrage frankly at at not having answers
because again it's been a month. How was
this possible? Um the questioning was
was fairly you know I I think it was it
was it wasn't toned down but I think I
think everybody is perplexed. The
members of Congress are just as
perplexed as the FBI at least as they
pretend to be or as Wheeler
kind of portray during this hearing. Was
there anybody from the Defense
Department there today?
>> No, I don't believe so. It was the It
was the um Department of Justice, FBI,
and then and then a gentleman from I
think from ICE or or uh Border Patrol.
>> Why was the Department of Justice not
called? I mean, one of the things that
worries me about Congress is they
sometimes aren't asking the right
people. I mean surely if this is a
national security issue, which it surely
is, if these drones, if they are drones,
are hovering over Pikatini Arsenal and
other weapons facilities, why wasn't the
Department of Defense called and put
under oath and asked a hard question. I
I I just don't get it. I I truly do not
get why people are just so tamely
accepting assurances from the Defense
Department that these are drones and
that there's no public threat.
>> How can they give that? How can they
give that assurance if they we now know
from what you've heard today, they have
no idea what these objects are?
>> It it is a great question and frankly I
don't I actually don't know if this this
hearing was pre-planned or if it was set
up just specifically for this incident
or these incidents, excuse me. Um but
you're right. I mean the defense
department has equities here. I would
say I think and this was a question that
came up in the hearing. Who who's
running the show here? Whose
jurisdiction is this? And I I suspect um
the FBI has the lead because this is
occurring over right not just military
facilities occurring over residential
facilities, cities, critical
infrastructure which generally would
would be the FBI's turf and they're
clueless. Completely completely
clueless.
So there was also, as I understood it, a
representative of the National Football
League due to give evidence to the
committee. Do you know why that is? Why
on earth was the NFL called to a
homeland security hearing about drones?
>> Yes. So, so, uh, the NFL has has very
significant concerns with the the all
the games that they put on, right? And
they have 50, 60, 70, 80,000 individuals
in a stadium. Um, you know, it's not
difficult, as we've seen, um, in Syria
and Ukraine, it's not difficult to, um,
leverage off-the-shelf drone technology
um, for for nefarious ends, for
terrorists, for for terrorist attacks,
terrorism, for um, gosh, chemical
weapons. We hope we don't have to ever
think about that, but that is why this
is this is what the government's job is
to think about these these potential
threats and and proactively mitigate
them. And in the case of New Jersey and
all these other incidents that have
occurred over the last several years,
they've failed, utterly failed to even
identify the operators, which is
astounding to me.
So, we're in this weird situation now,
Merrick, where the Congress now knows
that the FBI doesn't know anything, and
by implication, neither does Homeland
Security, and neither do any of the
agencies that are supposedly there to
protect both flight safety and national
security. Where the hell do we go from
here?
>> And that is a the trillion dollar
question. And you know if if past and
the precedent you know is is any kind of
indication these
uh incursions will will stop and they
will pop up again. Right? We just in the
in we right before the New Jersey
incursions there were several over three
military bases US military bases in the
UK. Um, and the frequency seems to be
picking up. Before that, we had Langley
Air Force Base 17 days where they were
so perplexed that they had to request a
special NASA aircraft with a very
sophisticated camera system to get
imagery of these things. To my
knowledge, they didn't get anything. Um,
so gosh, I don't know what what the
future holds. Will these incursions
continue? Will they spread? Will they
stop and pop up somewhere else? Um, all
I can do is follow this and and and uh
keep an open mind.
So, what came out of the hearing? I
mean, was there any conclusion aside
from the fact that they know nothing?
>> I think the the bottom line takeaways
for me are number one, the FBI is
utterly confounded and perplexed by
this. They he the Wheeler said that they
had reviewed video evidence. They had
credible sightings from police officers.
So, this is not all mass. I will concede
that a lot of the videos that people
have posted were of helicopters or or
very mundane objects at close range.
That's fine. Um but there is clearly an
issue here. It's not all masses. That's
that's abundantly clear. Um so bottom
lines FBI is clueless and the the
sightings described by Congressman Smith
are truly astounding. I mean 50 objects
coming in off the ocean. Oh, by the way,
this is where Lieutenant Ryan Graves and
multiple squadrons. um we're seeing all
these objects via their sensors and and
occasionally with their eyeballs um off
the US east coast. So um fascinating
dynamic and u this is something I will
be following very closely. Um I'll say
one more quick thing. Look, this is this
is a pattern. If the government if this
happens again now and the government is
caught flatfooted again, if it happens
somewhere else, boy, we're we're in a in
a really bad position here because um
this is just egregious and it's it's
outrageous.
>> Yeah, but Merrick, I don't No, I mean I
you look back to the public reaction in
February 2023 when the Chinese balloon
incident happened and Congress and the
public, the national media, they went
nuts because of one Chinese balloon that
flew across the continental USA. I don't
understand why multiple, as you say, in
some cases 50 alleged drones coming in
off the sea onto sensitive military
facilities in New Jersey. why that's not
an absolutely gigantic issue in all of
the mainstream media. I I I I mean I I
guess I sound like a scratchy record on
this, but what do you think is going on?
Is the media being told to shut up?
You you you almost have to ask that
question now, right? I I from I'd like
to think that that's not the case, but
you have to ask that question. I mean,
okay, the New York Times did a piece. Um
it is being picked up. That's that to be
fair. I mean, if you if you Google
drones, but um gosh, you know, it is it
is not the level of h I wouldn't call it
hysteria, but interest that the that the
Chinese uh balloon um I I think perhaps
because these are identified and and if
we have if we if we do capture one, it
says made in Moscow or made in Beijing,
maybe the dynamic will change, right?
Because then you have a a potential for
a geopolitical crisis. U maybe that's
what's what's at the root here. I I
don't know, but it's it's a it's a very
good question that I'm glad you're
asking.
>> Politically, though, with an incoming
president who's vowed to get to the
bottom of the so-called deep state with
probably no love for the FBI, isn't this
a bloody nightmare for the FBI that they
can't provide an explanation for what is
potentially the biggest national
security crisis in recent years? And oh
by the way, Ross, these sightings were
in the very near proximity to Trump's
Bedminister Bedminster, New Jersey golf
club. So yes, absolutely. Um I don't
know if there's any kind of symbolism
there if that is intentional, but um
that is you bring up a good point. It's
it has all the makings of um a heck of a
heck of a storm.
One thing for sure, Merrick von
Renenamp, the next few weeks are going
to be very rocky and very interesting,
especially as the inauguration
approaches in late January. Merrick von
Renenamp from The Hill, thank you so
much for joining us and giving us your
insights on today's Homeland Security
Committee hearing.
>> Thanks so much, Ross. Always great to
speak with you.
So, as we've heard from Merrick, this is
a phenomenon that hasn't just happened
in the last couple of weeks. It doesn't
just go back months. It doesn't just go
back years. It goes back decades. This
is a phenomenon of unexplained objects
hovering over sensitive unit United
States facilities, often being ignored
by the official government agencies that
are responsible for protecting our
security. The big question that comes
out of tonight's episode is what is the
president,
Congress, the defense department,
Homeland Security, the FBI, and every
other government agency going to do
about it. There is clearly a national
security issue raised by what we've
discussed tonight. There's clearly a
flight safety issue raised. We don't
know yet for sure whether the UAP, the
phenomenon of unexplained anomalous
phenomena, is in any way connected with
the objects that we're seeing over New
Jersey and other parts of the United
States and the United Kingdom. But we're
allowed to ask. And tomorrow you're
going to hear from a local on the ground
in New Jersey. You're going to hear from
the Tedesco brothers, John and Jerry
Tedesco.
And we're also going to give you the
opportunity to ask me your questions.
So, join us again on Reality Check
tomorrow night for what is this two-part
special series on the drones debacle,
the crisis unfolding in our skies over
the United States and indeed most of the
planet. What the hell is it? Keep on
watching because News Nation's going to
take you there. The rest of the
mainstream media might be ignoring this
issue, but we're there like a dog on a
bone and we're going to cover this issue
whether they like it or not and we're
going to try and get you answers. Thank
you for joining us. Good day and welcome
to Reality Check. Before we start this
week's show, a quick word about this
week's sponsor, Dr. Amy Lee. She's a US
boardcertified physician and expert
nutritionist sharing her warning about
three harmful foods she'd like you to be
aware of. She says these foods cause
weight gain, they clog your digestive
tract, they deplete your energy, and
they wreck your skin. In fact, they're
banned in other countries, but not in
America. She's got a new video art which
you can watch at
threeharmfulfoods.com/ross.
That's numeral3harmfulfoods.com/
ross. Dr. Lee details how to spot and
avoid these foods so you can experience
easier weight loss, smooth digestion,
and vibrant energy. We're linking to the
video below, but once again, that link

ross. Now, let's get on with this week's
show.
[Music]
Welcome back to Reality Check once
again. I'm in Egypt and boy, it's been
an amazing experience. It's full of
mysteries, this place.
The biggest mystery is the advanced
technology that lies behind the
magnificent structures like the Great
Pyramid of Giza,
138 m of limestone blocks. How did a
civilization that
didn't actually have the wheel, only had
copper tools, if they were lucky, build
such a gigantic object? It's only when
you walk around the Great Pyramid of
Giza and look up its steep sides and you
realize what a feat of workmanship it
was for whatever era it was that it was
built in. If you accept that it was
built, say 5,500 years ago at the very
beginnings of the donastic Egyptian
pharaohic civilization, it was an
incredible accomplishment because not
only is it level to perfection besides
straight to perfection,
it's just a mammoth engineering task.
And I struggle to see how we could
replicate it today. I mean, it is
massive.
It's all inspiring and like most of
Egypt, there's a mystery behind its
construction. We just can't explain the
technologies that were used to build it.
It suggests very strongly that there was
perhaps a prior advanced civilization
that we don't know about. So have a look
at this lump of bassalt sitting here in
front of the Great Pyramid of Giza. It's
perfectly cut. Absolutely perfectly cut
at a 90° angle. And it looks like
something's gone right through this
gigantic lump of bassalt. And I can't
explain how we would cut that today
without a a very strong diamond tipped
saw. So, how did a either donastic
Egyptian civilization, which I think is
unlikely, or a far earlier ancient
civilization cut a block of bassalt like
this?
>> Got any answers for me? JP,
>> pull them up my hat.
>> So, well, meet JP H, my good friend, a
lawyer from Maitius, who also happens to
have an interest in the esoteric. Where
are we, JP? Well, Rosco, it doesn't take
a million guesses to find out that we
are outside Manari Pyramid, the smallest
of the three pyramids on the Giza
Plateau. It's uh the only pyramid on the
three that I've not actually entered
like yourself.
And uh I'm excited to see what's inside.
So I'm told that that gouge in the side
of Menari is because of the son of
Saladdin in 1200 and something. They
tried dismantling the pyramid on dad's
instructions and apparently it took them
ages and ages and they weren't able to
achieve it. And uh a lot of the stones
that they dismantled it from are still
sort of scattered at the bottom of the
pyramid. And it really does beg the
question, if they had so much difficulty
disassembling the pyramid, how in God's
name did they build it 5,000 plus years
ago?
>> It's a good question.
>> You know, it's funny, JP. I have a
really strong sense that what we're
doing right now is exactly what people
were doing 100 years ago, 200 years ago,
a thousand years ago. This has been a
perennial thing coming to these
pyramids. And yet, it's a huge mystery.
>> Yeah.
>> How the hell did they build these
things? But they they're just I mean the
term iconic comes to mind and there's
something archetypal about them. There
is a sacred geometry to uh the shape of
the pyramid. It represents the divine
the creator.
>> Later
sir
>> later. Thank you.
>> Um and even the camels and the uh their
riders are God's creation like us.
>> I love it.
>> Yeah. What's that middle current deck
called?
>> This is Katherine Pyramid. Um,
>> obviously meant to be named after the
king that's associated with it as a as a
tomb. But much like the Great Pyramid
and and and indeed this one, I don't
think these were tombs at all. I think
they are
>> multiple layers of
>> merging of science, technology,
spirituality, aestheticism.
>> Absolutely incredible. And they're
tapping a divine geometry
that we have lost or forgotten about in
our current times. Um,
and I I personally think that they were
initiatic centers
for
priest initiates to access the unseen.
And what I mean by that is extra sensory
type um information that requires a
degree of cultivation
and um inherent ability. Um very
difficult to prove but you know I often
think about the story of Napoleon inside
the great pyramid. Apparently, there's a
a sort of a myth or folklore that he was
initiated into the Freemasons
inside the Great Pyramid of Kufu, which
is just behind us. And um allegedly
initiated by the Count of St.
who's an interesting character
associated with the ideas of um
philosophical death, the idea of
immortality within the human form, the
human body. Um and apparently he spent
the night inside the pyramid and
received the vision of his waterloo to
come. And lo and behold, he came out the
next day and apparently was as pale as
as white as the driven snow.
>> Not it.
So,
>> let's get in there. JP,
>> let's do it. Ross,
>> morning.
Did we find the wild?
>> I have the ticket.
>> So, you don't think this was a
sarcophagus at all?
>> No, I think they were initiatic type uh
centers, devices,
um designed to act on human
consciousness.
Um,
>> connecting with something greater than
the self.
>> Oh god, this is where I regret being so
poor.
>> Oh my god.
>> Yeah.
Take my glasses off.
Oh, this isn't too bad compared to some
of them. Now, when we enter the Great
Pyramid at night, we're going to have
full access to the entire pyramid, which
means the
um subterranean chamber.
>> Yep.
>> And that is pretty difficult to get down
into. You have to crawl down on your
belly to get in there.
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
So really there's No evidence at all
that these were sarcopaga.
>> No, they just happen to be granite boxes
that are there and the assumption made
that they were tombs for kings, which of
course doesn't exclude the fact that
bodies could have been put there after
they were the pyramids were built
thousands of years before.
>> So you think was a more plausible
explanation that these are somehow some
kind of what a an amplifier, a
communications device? Yeah, I think
there are initiatic centers highly
complex that were built um for an
iniatic and uh as well as a functional
purpose and it deals with this idea of
the invisible coming into contact with
the material world.
>> And do you really think they're just
5,500 years old?
>> My speculation is they're far older.
>> So Jeffy, the thing I find most
perplexing is looking around at these
walls. I mean the supposedly this was
built 5,000 plus years ago.
How the hell did they do this with what
they had at the time which was stone and
copper edzes?
>> I just don't think it's a plausible
explanation and um you know particularly
in the time scales that the pyramids
were supposedly built in. Um how did
they maneuver all the granite and
limestone all the way here? I mean these
>> how did they perfectly fit?
>> I mean they're perfectly square walls,
you know, how do you do this with a
bronze edge?
>> Yeah,
these were these were master masons in
the fullest sense.
>> And I think the tech the techniques and
the organization around it has to have
been so much more complex than we can
imagine.
I don't buy all the kind of maneuvering
through lo you know wooden logs and um
you know sort of mass production through
chain
uh manufacturing and so on.
>> The thing I find amazing about this JP
is it's a mystery in plain sight.
>> I mean
>> you look at these buildings
constructions whatever you call them
>> edififices. head of this
>> and where did they meet?
>> I don't think we could build this today
>> with difficulty. Not in this manner.
>> So, how did they build it four, five,
6,000 plus years ago?
>> Probably with uh a technique techniques
and knowledge that we are just
>> out of touch with right now. And um in
isolation, it's highly questionable and
debatable. But when you look at Egypt as
a whole and some of the sites and the
perfection of the cutting, the smooth
boring of um granite and laser-like
sheet cutting of the granite as well,
you you have to ask yourself at what
point in time did this come in and um
what were the construction and uh you
know masonic techniques used because
there is a disconnect between the
official Egyptological narrative and the
reality on the ground that those with
eyes that see see
>> a mystery in plain sight.
>> Exactly.
[Music]
>> Here we are.
>> The ancient sphinx.
>> Hello, darling.
[Music]
Put your head in there. There's a
resonance. You hear a resonance that
goes like,
>> "Okay, in I go."
>> Oh, yeah.
>> It's like a throbbing V8 engine.
>> I hope that come through on the
microphone.
>> How extraordinary.
You hear a resonance, a throbbing
>> like a an engine deep inside the
building.
>> What an extraordinary thing.
So, here we are at the Maidum pyramid
about 2 hours out of Cairo and it's
massive. Absolutely huge. Get a load of
this. Absolutely gigantic.
>> It's a weird shape.
And unfortunately, there's a lot of
stairs.
Okay, here we go. My next pyramid.
It's a long way down.
Actually, it's not too bad. It's not as
low as the last one I climbed in.
And it's a very helpful handrail.
well polished by lots of frightened
tourists.
My goodness me.
So, here we are deep underneath the my
doom pyramid. All very Raiders of the
Lost Ark. You wouldn't want to have a
fear of confined spaces coming in here.
It's pretty tight.
Ah.
So this is the burial tomb.
>> It's been a very climax to be perfectly
honest.
[Music]
>> I mean, you'd be pretty upset if you
were grave robber and you come all the
way down here and there's nothing in
here. So imagine you're an enterprising
grave robber. It's a th000 AD. You chip
your way through tons of limestone
looking for the treasure of the
emperor's burial chamber and you find
this. I mean, really, you know, one of
the hassles of climbing pyramids is
you've got to get out of them again.
Have a look at this.
Oh my goodness.
[Music]
>> JP, what was that about UFOs in this
pyramid?
>> Well, apparently there were sightings of
UFOs appearing over the pyramid and
around the area uh between the years of
1986 and 2016, which is a 30-year
period, pretty long.
>> What's this pyramid called? This is
called the Maidon Lahun Pyramid.
>> Apologies. Yeah.
>> Lahun.
>> Lahun.
>> And it's mud bricks over
limestone.
>> Why would UFOs be attracted to this area
in particular?
>> Oh,
pre-denastic uh happenings, I would
suspect. Um maybe we don't understand
what the use of this site was or who was
here, but um
>> drawn to the energy or something. That's
what I was going to say cuz actually I
can feel it right now.
>> Oh, you can.
>> Yeah. It's a very positive uh uplifting
energy and I think it was kind of uh
fitting that we saw two buses full of
beautiful school children that were
happy to see it.
>> Gorgeous. They were lovely kids.
>> Beautiful. The innocence of the child.
Just love it.
[Music]
>> So, we're here at Abbidos, which is the
temple of Osiris. And I'm told, here is
some of the most spectacular art that
really does raise intriguing questions
about just exactly what was going on in
our prehistory here in ancient Egypt.
Let's go and have a look.
>> Okay, let's put this debate away. Why
Ozirus? Why not Rah? Why not Amun? Why
not? Because Ozirus is the one who was
killed, died, and came back to life. So
Ozirus here means what? Resurrection.
So the ancient Egyptians the dynastics
when they found that the power of this
place are similar or a reason for
resurrection so they give it this title
Ozirus temple.
[Music]
So, I'm currently crawling down a very
narrow staircase into what's called the
main crypt of the Dendara Temple where
there is the Dendara light bulb and you
have to squeeze down into a very narrow
space which I'll just show you. It's
quite extraordinary.
>> Ross, you'll be rescuing me.
>> Here we go.
>> Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness me. It's
about 2 ft high, that little hole.
I thought they were tiny little fellas,
those Egyptians, or they had a sense of
humor.
>> That's more like
>> So, here we are. We're still going down
this path. Oh, look at this. The luxury
of it. We've got a capacity to stand up.
>> So, it's funny actually. You'd think it
would be really cold down here with the
stone, but it's actually incredibly hot.
>> Super warm. We've got four pillars with
Hakon as the as the cow.
>> What's So we're looking at light
frequency,
>> sound, resonance.
>> Look at that. That that looks like
electricity being represented.
>> It does. It looks like energy and we've
got light and sound represented and
there and the sound is supported by a
pillar. But under you know underneath
supporting the sound is light.
>> Sound light and frequency. And look, we
have the physical the physicality, the
temple or temples being raised by these
strands or cords of energy that are
emanating from another source or pillar
of some kind.
>> So, do you think that's a literal
representation of a technology or do you
think I'm being too literal?
>> No. No, I mean if we look at the uh uh
the depictions that were in the second
hall when we arrived, we see a physical
movement of the temple being physically
levitated off the floor because we can
see it being lifted off the floor. It's
not touching the floor which is very
very clearly kind of delineated. And
here we've got some interaction between
the spectrum of light, sound
obviously represents frequency and
resonance and then waves of energy
>> which you see in the uh celestial zodiac
in um Aquarius.
>> That one really gets me. If ever you
were going to represent electricity
contained with a vessel, that's it.
>> That's it. Actually, you can you can see
a light and and you can see a cable
going into it, can't you? Absolutely.
>> It looks like technology is all I'd say.
>> It does, doesn't it?
>> I mean, it's hard to escape the idea
that that's something electrical, but
maybe we're um what's it called?
Paridolia. Maybe we're
>> we're putting our human impressions onto
objects, onto symbology.
>> Absolutely.
>> Or maybe maybe it's technology.
>> Maybe nothing.
>> So, this is in the temple of Dindara.
And these are what look like light
bulbs.
[Music]
It's amazing to be here in the Valley of
the Kings, which is where many of the
pharaohs were buried in secret with a
huge number of the incredible treasures,
the things that Howard Carter described
when he found the tomb of Tuton Carman
as wonderful things. But there's a
mystery. There's a conundrum behind that
whole story. Who on earth made these
incredible technologies, these fine
stone vases, the beautiful carved
statuary, the incredibly well-honed
granite blocks that are accurate,
sometimes within micro millimeters? How
do we explain those technologies with
what we understand were the tools of
that era? The pre-denastic Egyptian
civilizations, if they were lucky at
all, had copper chisels. More likely,
they had flints and stone adses. Then
how do we explain the beautiful objects,
the wonderful things that Howard Carter
described when he opened the tomb of
Tuten Carman. So we're going down to the
tomb of Ramsy's III,
deep underground in the Valley of the
Kings. And not surprisingly because it's
a nice cool time of year here in Egypt.
It's like Grand Central Station at
Russia.
But it's still pretty special coming
down here and knowing that what we're
standing in is a building that was built
at least thousands of years ago. And
there's a real question mark about this
whole claim about this
civilization that existed here. Was it
actually
the tombs of the pharaohs that it was
built for or was it perhaps built for
another purpose and then reused by the
pharaohs later on? That's the theory
we're exploring.
I can only imagine what it must have
been like for the early explorers to
rediscover these tombs and realized that
what they'd stumbled across were the the
tomb of an ancient king. But the real
question mark is was this originally
conceived as the tomb of an ancient king
or did it perhaps have an even earlier
purpose? I have to admit it does tend to
destroy the beauty of experiencing these
tombs or whatever they are to share them
with thousands and thousands of other
people. But you do get an incredibly
profound sense of just how old these
places are. I mean, if you think about
what they estimate, it's at least 4
5,000 years old. And if you listen to
the experts we're talking to on this
tour, it's possibly tens, maybe hundreds
of thousands of years old. It's a
mystery in plain sight.
>> There's a blue deity for you.
>> A blue deity?
>> Yes.
>> And there's one of my blue guy friends.
>> Huh?
Hey, blue guys,
>> tell me your secret. Here I am heading
down into the tomb of another ancient
king. Perhaps on my own journey into the
afterlife,
[Music]
deep deep under the valley of the kings.
>> It's absolutely massive this place. You
should see it.
Yes.
>> Incredible to think that these drawings,
these p these paintings are thousands of
years old.
And so here's a an ancient sarcophagus
carved out of what looks like solid
granite.
>> Now, are you telling me they they made
that with
copper chisels.
>> I'm sorry. I I strongly doubt it.
>> I have a really strong sense in this
place that
all the carvings, the hieroglyphics, and
indeed perhaps even the sarcophagus
came a lot later.
This really feels like a room that was
built for another purpose. So the
conventional view in modern Egyptology
is that all of these heroic tombs in the
Valley of the Kings were actually built
by the donastic Egyptians during the
period of the pharaohs.
But there's a growing possibility,
speculation, and it's really only
speculation at this stage that these
tombs aren't really tombs at all that
they might in fact have been here before
the donastic Egyptians arrived on the
scene. And maybe they used these
existing cave tunnel structures for
their own purposes to bury their
pharaohs. And it begs the question, who
built these tunnels? Who had the
capacity to hue great lumps of granite
and cut it to often micro millimeter
accuracy? Is the alleged sarcophagus
deep inside the tomb I've just visited,
is it really a a burial sarcophagus or
is it something else? That's the
question. Are we misunderstanding a lot
of what we take for granted as accepted
truths about modern Egypt? I think this
one's called satup. Forgive me for the
misprononunciation, which I'm sure I've
done, but the interesting thing about
this is that it's uncompleted.
Looks less and less like a foic burial
chamber.
[Music]
>> Was this really a burial chamber for a
pharaoh originally or was it designed
for some other purpose?
Certainly, it's uncompleted.
>> I'm not so sure. And neither are the
experts we're talking to. They think
these
caverns may have been here before and
were adapted for purpose by the
pharaohs.
And maybe, just maybe, these supposedly
sarcophagi
aren't sarcophagi at all. So, riddle me
this. Explain this to me. Have a look at
the hieroglyphic scratchings on the end
of what they say is a burial
sarcophagus.
And if you have a look, I'm just going
to turn my camera around,
[Music]
>> you see these almost like chicken
scratchings into the end of the granite
sarcophagus. And whoever it was that did
these etchings clearly only had the
copper chisels of the time in donastic
Egypt. And they were struggling to etch
into the granite.
So,
whoever it was that crafted this entire
sarcophagus, if that's what it was, had
the ability to cut granite in ways that
even the experts admit they can't
explain for what the tools were in
modern donastic Egypt.
It's the best sort of mystery, a riddle
in plain sight. There's no getting over
it.
These gigantic dolomite granite statues
are completely beyond comprehension.
There is no way humans built these.
Simple as that. Even the official Egypt
archaeological explanation can't provide
an answer for how humans of the era
built these statues in the pre-denastic
civilization. So that's at least 12,000
years ago. It's a mystery sitting here
in the obvious plane and nobody could
explain it
and thousands of tourists walk past
every day. And don't ask that question.
>> If it wasn't the known human
civilization then did it.
>> This one here
>> who who did do it? You you think a
machine you think some kind of machine
built there that
>> some some some kind of machines and some
kind of like an operating system for the
machine. Okay. Because that's operating
system guiding the machine to do the
that perfection. Okay. This operating
system is made by humans or made by AI.
I don't think it's only humans because
uh
they were humans were not made such
perfection. And what's the minimum age
that that statue would be?
>> Well, I will tell you when we go inside,
but most of the statues were having here
more breed lians breed the word breedian
could mean a lot for us. But we can age
we can give an age to most of the
monuments from the breedian times.
Mostly they are over 12,000 years old.
Okay. But how old exactly? I think it
was most of these were being made during
the time of Shimisuher. Most of the
statues especially the statues they were
made during the time of Shimisuho and
Shimisuho is about 20,000 to 12,000
years back. Okay. Why they made statues
to remember the first humans who brought
the civilization to us. Okay. These
statues are not for ancesters or I mean
second three or any of the dynastic
kings. There are some statues yes from
the dynastic times but not the red
grabbit or the granite like these
statues are over 200 tons. Okay. 200 to
300 tons. This one is up to 200 tons. Of
course we can't understand that humans
with primitive techniques and also even
by our ways of thinking with our
advanced techniques. Now we can't
understand how humans could able to do
this. So when scientists did a laser
scan of this amazing granite dolomite
statue, one of the hardest stones in the
world, they were absolutely astonished
because the head is absolutely
symmetrical. If you put a line down the
middle of the head and go to the eyes,
go to the ears, everything perfectly
matches. I think we'd be hardpressed to
replicate that today. And yet, from what
the tour is telling me, this statue is
probably over 10,000 years old minimum.
It's suggestive of an unknown, possibly
human civilization that existed here.
That explains the technology. I mean,
who had the tools to be able to carve
dolomite granite?
All around this ancient temple of Carak,
there are the most amazing blocks of
granite, bassalt,
alabaster, and they've been cut to
tolerances that I suspect we'd struggle
to replicate today.
This
needle is hundreds of tons and it's cut
out of one piece of solid granite. I
mean, it's breathtaking. I I look around
and the mystery is in plain sight.
There's a conundrum. How do we explain
how these objects were built? This is
the temple of Car.
And this was given as a title to men,
the stable form of the sun. This was the
name of a king called Moses 3.
So what does it mean here? In my
opinion, the secret people of the
technology of the stargates. So he the
one could activate the stargate.
>> Originally this was one piece.
The whole room was made from one block.
Okay, if you look carefully, you can see
this wall was connected with the
ceiling. Can you see the connection? But
it was destroyed.
Okay, here
the the ceiling was connected to here
and this is was connected to the j door
jambs also the other side. Okay. So, I
know for sure and from another example,
we're going to see it later that this
was one giant block of alabaster. Okay.
>> When we talk about cutting limestone
and we think it is easy and alabaster is
easy and we talk about cutting granite,
okay, which is hard. Actually, we can
also flip the meaning. How to cut
granite? It is super hard because it is
very hard material material. So you need
very high machine, very high uh
technology. Okay.
But I can tell you if we use what we
call it uh a tool with so much
vibration, granite can stand against
this vibration. Okay? So if you have a a
mechanical drill and you are drilling on
granite, the piece will not shattered
easily even with this force.
But if you do this on limestone or
alabaster,
one little vibration can break it like
glass. So here is the problem. It is not
super hard to cut, but it is super
sensitive.
And you can see these lines. Can you see
these lines? These are deposits above
each other here. Look what happened.
So if I have now any pressure I put any
pressure here, it will separate this
line. So all the stories about using uh
primitive techniques even it doesn't
fit. Why? Because they are under the
ground. So they must have machines. And
when you cut this piece from under the
ground, okay, then you try to find a way
to take it out
>> without breaking.
>> Okay, without breaking it, of course.
Okay, and then from that level the the
story in Egyptology will start about how
to take it outside the quarry. So they
keep talking about how they cut this in
deep level and then take it outside this
groove or this cave.
Here we are in Edfu Temple.
It's quite special.
It's also crowded.
>> Beautiful sandstone walls covered with
incredible hieroglyphics,
including hieroglyphics of what looks
like a temple being levitated. All
around Egypt, there are intriguing
little hints that the Egyptians in
ancient times had abilities perhaps that
we don't have today. One of the things
that uh is suggested from the
hieroglyphs is the possibility that they
developed the art of levitation. Have a
look at this.
What you see there is
a cord apparently lifting a temple off
the ground.
And some of the scientists believe that
what this is is an example of some kind
of levitation ability.
I'm reserving judgment, but whatever it
is, it's pretty intriguing. There was a
connection between this lady and the
stars. Especially her outfit in some
places is decorated with a lot of scenes
looks like stars and sometimes I believe
they look like the flower of life. Okay.
And after they fix the boundaries of the
temple here they are fixing exactly
where the temple will will be built. So
it was not being done by the king only.
There's someone celestial has to choose
the location of the temple. If you
remember Muhammad was telling you that
temples are out of many elements. Okay,
the alignment and also the location are
the most important elements in building
temples. After that, the man is brewing
water. But I don't think it's water on
the ground of the temple because the
water is mostly represented like waves
like this one. Okay. But this one is not
like water. Okay. This one seems like
the dots we have seen surrounding the
temple outside. And we have also here
kind of what we studied. These are the
foundation offerings. Not the foundation
offerings. These are devices to help for
the levitation process. Okay. Yeah.
Because we are controlling gravity by
these kind of devices. Okay. It's not
something like the energy wave you're
surrounding the temple. There should be
an opposite energy underneath the
temple. So they make that kind of
levitation. So they start with these.
This is adding kind of like chemicals or
something like that which is giving the
energy or will catalyze the energy of
these things here on the ground and
after that surrounding the temple with
the field of energies like the one we
have seen outside and that's causes what
causes this.
[Music]
Oh, that's the levitation.
>> That's the levitation. Wi-Fi
and the muffin.
Okay. Of course, that's ridiculous.
Okay. Just similar to the lamp of uh of
Dandara. Okay. Unfortunately, some
people u are being fooled with these
interpretations. They are not having
like um a kind of um of logic evidians
for that. Okay. What I think we are
having here that's a kind of basket what
we have studied that it's reps of meat
okay reps of an animal so it refers to
meat but I don't think so because
there's some spaces between these lines
okay so what is that exactly I think it
was a basket
[Music]
so here at the temple of comubo
there uh more mysteries in plain sight.
I mean, quite apart from the fact that
this is exquisitly carved rock, there's
just the simple practicality, how did a
civilization that was essentially
not long out of flint adses and stone
adses
capable of lifting gigantic stone beams
like this one? I mean, it's
breathtaking.
They're absolutely monstrous. There must
be 20 to 50 tons.
And there's dozens of them all over this
building.
>> I've got to hand it to Egypt. It's
pretty bloody spectacular.
[Music]
So, here's one of the biggest mysteries
of all. What's called the unfinished
obelisk in Azwan in southern Egypt. It's
the quarry where all the red granite
that was found further north came from.
We don't know how they got that granite
up the Nile River, and we sure as hell
don't know how they moved objects as
large as this one. Have a look at this.
This is the unfinished obelisk. It's
absolutely massive. Carved out of one
lump of granite. It's absolutely
gigantic.
It still sits embedded in the granite
bedrock
and it's enormous. The cuts are almost
90° accurate.
And when you look very closely, like
look here,
you can see what look like scoop marks
in the granite.
Now, nobody can really explain where
those scoop marks came from. They're
sure as hell not explained by men with
stone adses.
It's a mystery that nobody has ever been
able to solve.
So, here's a mystery.
Have a look at this part of the obelisk.
You can see they've tried probably in
donastic times to cut a smaller lump of
granite out of this big unfinished
obelisk and they failed. They couldn't
do it. So a later civilization came to
this obelisk and tried to cut a slab out
of it and failed. Which all begs the
question, who was it who cut this
gigantic obelisk?
Who cut this gigantic obelisk?
big enough
>> before donastic Egypt.
>> JP, I see a gigantic lump of granite. An
almost incomprehensively large grump of
granite. It must be hundreds and
hundreds of tons.
>> Yep. It's uh a mystery that something so
large can be shaped, sculpted, uh and
effectively excavated from
this rose granite which is harder than
steel. Um and
you know, the only evidence that we're
being given is that hard rocks were used
over hundreds of years.
>> I think that's hilarious.
Using hard rocks to chip away something
as accurate as this unfinished obl.
Yeah, I think this is beyond 2001 a
space odyssey. I think um advanced uh
tooling was used. My speculation would
be sonic tools that um could effectively
resonate the uh granite at such a high
frequency that it would probably been um
you know disintegrated into dust and it
being led which could explain why you
see these kind of ice cream scoop marks
which are so smooth and perfect. I guess
the other question is how on earth would
they have lifted something as large as
this out of this quarry and transported
it up the river to wherever they wanted
to move it.
>> Exactly. And when you when you think
about it the depictions in Edfu temple
on the Nile in Kombo and indeed even in
Dendara temple the temple of Hatur where
we see this uh uh these beings these
kings um effectively using some kind of
energy lines that lift or raise the
temple. In one image you can see the
temple is affixed to the ground. In the
next image you see a a field around the
temple and it's you know depicted as
being lifted from the ground.
>> So you think they had levitation?
>> It would make sense. The only question
is how. So get a load of this absolutely
massive lump of red granite. One of the
hardest stones in the world. Now, this
is probably pre-dynastic Egypt. Our tour
guide is suggesting that it's possibly
older than 12,800 years old. Now, that
civilization, according to
archaeologists, didn't have even metal
tools. That's precopper tools. But look
how accurately this incredible
unfinished obelisk has been cut. Almost
90° cuts. And the weird thing about it
is these strange scoop marks in the in
the granite. I mean, seriously, I don't
know anything about rocks or cutting
rocks, but the idea that they used a
stone like this to cut this is utterly
absurd.
>> So, the suggestion from Egyptology is
that is what they did to smooth and cut
the rock.
>> Yes. um which is frankly a cavemanlike
explanation that draws images from 2001
Space Odyssey in the opening scenes.
>> 300,000 years later.
>> Yeah. Still going still going strong.
Believe in the process.
>> Now, trust me.
[Music]
>> So, here's another mystery.
>> We're on Elephantine Island.
And Elephantine Island is the site of
the most extraordinary
lumps of solid diorite granite, one of
the hardest stones in the world. And
these objects are supposedly
pre-doluvian, which means they're older
than 12,800
years old before known human
civilization.
And yet, have a look at them. Look at
the accuracy of the cutting. I don't
think a culture that had stone adses and
flint adses could possibly have created
these. This is what they look like.
Absolutely extraordinary.
Absolutely perfect right angles cut into
one of the strongest stones in the
world. And it's like this whole area,
it's as if a whole bomb has gone off.
These things have been thrown aside in
what looks like some kind of massive
explosion.
And this is the Piesta Resistance,
a near intact box that is exquisitly cut
out of diorite. Actually, no, that's red
granite.
Still an extremely hard rock. And this
was supposedly made 12,800 years ago in
the pre-denastic civilization. Nobody
can explain how something like this box
was carved out of solid red granite.
It's just a mystery and what caused it
to be thrown aside like this.
Look inside there and see those perfect
90° lines.
>> Yeah,
>> that is an exquisitly cut stone box.
That would be a challenge to do even
today, let alone
>> 12,800 years ago.
>> You see the circular cut there as well.
>> Absolutely. Yeah. There's obviously a
cut for doors.
>> That is extraordinary.
>> And there's not The other thing JP I
noticed is there's no striations in the
um in the granite. It doesn't look like
somebody's used a saw.
>> No.
[Music]
You only have to come here to the
Egyptian Museum to realize there is a
mystery in plain sight in ancient Egypt.
How were exquisite objects like these
gigantic stone statues carved out of
dolomite? How were they fashioned?
Here's another beautiful example of the
dilemma, the mysterious dilemma in the
Cairo Museum. Among fairly
simply crafted pottery vases, there are
these absolutely exquisite stone vases
and they are absolutely magnificent.
Carved out of solid granite, they defy
explanation. Have a look.
These are absolutely beautiful objects
that on analysis, Ben Vancquick told us
the other week, on analysis, they show
perfect symmetrical form
and they can't have been turned on a
wheel because those lugs would have
blocked any lathe. How do you explain
perfection in such an object that is
literally thousands, if not tens of
thousands of years old? And there are
vases like this all over the museum
here. Indeed, all over Egypt. And
they're next to fairly ordinary pottery
that frankly doesn't pass muster in
comparison. Clearly, there was some kind
of an advanced civilization that was
capable of building these beautiful
objects. And they sit here in this
museum very much unexplained.
All over this incredible museum, there
are objects that just defy explanation,
none better than this small little box
in a corner of the museum showing stone
pottery pots or stone pots that simply
are inexplicable.
That object up there is
something carved out of granite.
stone vessels.
There stone vases or vases as you say in
America and a lot of the elite of Egypt
were buried with these vases as Ben Van
Kirkwick told us the other week. But the
big issue is did they really make them?
Because the analysis that's been done by
Ben and Chris Dunn, the noted engineer,
suggests that these vasees are accurate
to a point of absurdity within
thousandth of a millimeter. And they
also follow precise divine mathematical
ratios.
How did a pre-dynastic civilization or
even an Egyptian donastic civilization
create something as exquisit as this?
That's solid stone. Here in the Cairo
Museum, the shist disc is one of the
most extraordinary objects in the
collection carved out of a really hard
stone called shist. It looks like some
kind of industrial fan. There's really
no explanation for how an ancient
civilization could have carved this
object. It's extraordinary. Have a look.
It's the weirdest looking object.
The best that they've been able to offer
on the explanation on the side of the
box here is it's a vessel. A vessel from
a high official's tomb. This unusually
shaped object comes from the tomb of
Sabu, a high official serving the first
dynasty king's den and Ajib. They
suggest it might have been used for
royal or religious ceremonies either as
part of an offering tray as or as
support for a vessel or a basket. So it
was found in the tomb of Sibu. The big
question is was it really crafted in the
reign of Sibu? The best theories have it
that this is actually pre-dynastic,
tens of thousands of years old, crafted
by some civilization, we just don't know
about. And that's the huge dilemma. All
over this beautiful museum, there are
objects that defy explanation. If you
accept that the technology of the era
was stone, flints, ads is or a little
bit later perhaps copper chisels, how do
you explain the perfection in many of
the objects in this museum? It really
does defy explanation.
>> Jackie, I see a big relet box.
uh tell me of that.
>> Well, it seems from the Egyptologists
that we've spoken to that they're not
actually uh shown or educated about this
particular box, which is probably the
most uh intriguing of all of the granite
objects here in the old Cairo Museum. So
there it says the official story says
that this is an unfinished sarcophagus
of death the king's son and they place
it at fourth dynasty king kufu about two
5512528
BC.
>> Yeah. So this is this is the uh pharaoh
that um the great pyramid is named after
purely based on a very questionable uh
cartou that was found in um one of the
chambers there by um uh a a military guy
called Vi who'd been found guilty of
political fraud in the UK. So on that
note, let's actually have a look at the
uh the cutting techniques for which
there are no explanations given other
than it soaring. Look at that. And you
can see this uh perfect sheet cut at the
rear that goes on both sides of this uh
slab.
And um
you know, there's a 90° angle that
rubs against the the main box itself.
>> So even though they say here that the
official story is that this is from
Kufu's sons, too, you think it's a lot
older? I think that that's um what a
number of uh Egyptologists are thinking
based on what they've seen in other
areas of the country and uh even some of
the objects here that just uh seem to be
far better than contemporary objects in
the donastic period.
>> I mean that looks like Can you see
striations in the rock there? Is there
any indication that there's a circular
saw being used?
>> None. It's as smooth as you like.
>> So how the hell did they cut that? That
is that is the question. Um
>> I mean even if even if it was domestic
Egypt, donastic Egypt didn't have
mechanical swords.
>> No. And and this is solid grid granite.
>> This is harder than steel. And you can't
use copper chisels on this material. No
organic matter as we know would be able
to achieve this kind of cutting and uh
smooth result.
>> It's absolutely mind-blowing. And and
the incredible thing is Ross is this is
probably one of the most important
pieces in the museum, but it's hidden at
the back against a very narrow wall
where you know people are going to miss
this because the most interesting side
is against this uh
>> I mean here we are. We're in the main
foyer of the museum and lots of people
are walking past completely unaware of
this box.
>> That's right.
>> I'd like
>> and yet what it shows is clearly some
kind of advanced technology.
more than reasonable to say.
>> Beautiful object.
>> A mystery. But
>> wow. And look, the the thing that really
gets me is it's almost mirror smooth.
>> Yeah.
>> There's no sign of
any cutting toolled at all. It's
>> I love the fact that you can get up
close and personal with these things.
>> Yeah.
>> So, you're not much bloody used JP. You
haven't told me the answer.
I wish I had the answer. As
>> basically, I mean, to be to not to not
sound frivolous, what we're talking
about here is an ancient technology that
we just don't understand.
>> That's right. And and my speculation is
it's probably acoustic or sonic cutting
tools that are literally um fragmenting
the material into dust and it just
produces this beautiful smooth finish
because there's no cutting. But isn't it
incredible that it's sitting here in the
Cairo Museum and essentially the mystery
behind it is unacknowledged
>> completely and as mentioned
Egyptologists aren't given any real
explanation other than it was a soaring
technique but there's no real evidence
for the fact that it was a sore so let's
just explain to our audience all they
had even in 2551 BC the time of kingdom
was if they were lucky copper proper
chisels,
>> something along those lines.
>> Or maybe stones for
>> stones that were used to cut away, but
it would have been very inefficient.
>> I don't think we could quite get to that
level of 90° accuracy using stones.
>> I agree.
>> Okay. Looks pretty normal from the
front. Yeah, looks pretty normal from
the front. Well, let's just have a look
behind.
>> All right. And then the rest of the
morning depictions.
>> Yeah, that's pretty normal, isn't it?
that the just
>> now these very weird statues
>> appear in the Cairo Museum
>> without any explanation at all
>> and these elongated heads
aren't explained
at all. They're quite beautiful.
>> But
who made them?
Nobody can explain. That's the cool
thing about ancient Egypt. There's
objects like this and nobody even
bothers to explain them in the biggest
museum in the country.
>> Yes,
>> maybe they can't.
>> Or maybe it's an inconvenient
explanation.
So, here we are walking through the
Egyptian Museum and what we're actually
looking for are artifacts that are
anomalous that deviate from the accepted
official history. And more often than
not, they're tucked away in discrete
corners without any explanation. And
here's one of them. So, the museum
itself admits that these vases are from
what it quaintly calls the archaic
period, which is essentially
pre-denastic heroic Egypt around about
10,000 plus years. And if you look at
these objects, they're stone vases
carved out of some of the toughest
stones known on this planet. Diorite,
bassalt.
How did a civilization that didn't have
the wheel, that didn't have even copper
chisels craft something like this? A
beautiful vase that is no doubt
mathematically symmetrical
carved out of some kind of dark stone be
it bassult or granite or diorite
whatever it is it's tougher than the
tools they had in the day to be able to
cut it.
[Music]
So I'd like to welcome Muhammad Ibrahim
to Reality Check. He's an Egyptologist
with incredible knowledge and experience
based on many many years work here in
Egypt studying the ancient ruins and
more importantly the ancient
technologies that must have been used to
craft the beautiful statuary and objects
that we've seen on our tour here.
There's a mystery, a conundrum in plain
sight. And I'm hoping Muhammad Ibrahim
can explain to me what lies behind that
mystery. So, I'm doing this with my
camera on the road, a one-man band. I'm
just about to switch across to Muhammad.
Muhammad, welcome to Reality Check. I'm
just going to put you on active track so
I have your face in the right shot.
Perfect. Tell me
what is the conventional view about when
the pyramids for example were
constructed.
>> Okay, before I answer the question we
must say that uh unfortunately so many
of our information and our theories
about ancient Egypt came from history
and written history can be faked easily
either by the ancients or by the modern.
Okay. So when it comes about the
pyramids because of history they say
that the pyramid was built in dynasty 4
during what we call a dynastic Egypt. So
we talk about around 2,600 BC.
>> Mhm.
>> And by the way sometimes history also is
not the problem. It is the lake of uh
written history because in this case
when we don't find uh much information
then we put assumption and unfortunately
most of the cases the assumption is
always wrong.
>> So let's talk about specifics. Let's
look for example at those beautiful
stone vases that we've looked at in the
museums and in some of the uh locations
that we've visited. Those are exquisite
objects carved from the finest, hardest
granite.
>> I mean, as I understand it, you need
>> something more than a copper chisel to
be able to shape something like that.
What do we know about the civilization
that archaeology tells us existed at
that time in Egypt? And how does that
compare to the level of technological
sophistication that you see in those
objects? These uh these sophisticated
jars and what I call it fancy jars were
found in the tombs of what we call them
pre-dynastic Egyptians and pre-dynastic
Egyptians all the academics including us
the alternative speakers we know that
they were primitive people they were
survivors from an earlier disaster and
they were developing uh very very basic
uh uh tools and technology and it's not
no way to believe that they can do such
vases. But what happened that when they
started to talk about these vases
when they started to talk about these
vases that was almost 150 years ago,
>> right?
>> So technology 150 years ago was not the
same level like we have nowadays. So in
my own opinion that was the problem that
was the u uh the the the thing caused
this kind of uh wrong information that
150 years ago there was no computers
like we do now. There is no uh
mechanical machines.
>> But clearly those vases I've got a bee
in my bonnet about them. There is no way
you could make that with a copper
chisel.
>> Of course. And as I told as I keep
saying all the time even at that time
redynastic there was no coerc.
So so even if we
>> so all they had were flint tools
>> flint tools uh wood wooden tools uh
ivory tools some kind of nails tools
>> and yet the groove marks that you've
pointed us to in your wonderful lecture
that showed striations that are
consistent with some kind of mechanical
turning.
>> Right. Clearly those vases were turned
like we turn objects on a la.
>> Yes. And uh the the work of some of the
uh uh engineers I know they did
measurements to the rim to the body to
the base and it happened that all these
vases are symmetrical the left side the
uh right side the height the top the
polishment. So as you said it's
impossible to be done without high
technology. So this is Chris Dunn's work
uh and the work that Ben Vancerwick has
worked on before. Exactly.
>> We've interviewed Ben for Reality Check.
In fact, he was on a short while ago
>> and we're now following up on the ground
here in Egypt. So we've we've
interviewed Ben
>> and he's told us what he's seen and
we've come and seen it for ourselves.
>> Mhm.
>> What is this then? Is this a prehuman
civilization?
It can be prehuman or as I believe it is
an early human civilization with
advanced technology, advanced knowledge.
>> If it is a pre
thishuman generation civilization,
>> how come there's no record of it? Why
have we not found any records or notes
or or descriptions of that human
civilization that you suggest might have
existed before now? No, we do, but we
don't see it in a good way. We we have
hundreds of evidence, but unfortunately,
we relate these evidence and these
products and these megalithic sites to
uh newer civilization. Like when you go
to Mexico, they say the Mayan. When you
go to other places, they always pick up
a modern date like 30,000 BC or 2,000
BC. So what age do you think for example
the pyramids are?
>> Okay, if we talk about the cycles of
civilizations, okay, at the ancient
Egyptians left uh the the information
for us, they say each cycle is around 25
to 26,000 years. The pyramid was built
either in the second cycle or the third.
So if we go backwards by time, so
between 75,000 BC and 100,000 BC.
Oh my god.
>> That if we talk about one uh one group
of cycles.
>> So you don't think the pyramids were
built 5 a half thousand years ago which
is I think the conventional Egyptology
explanation.
>> No it's impossible when you check the
constructions of dynasty 4 for sure we
know it was built by them. The technique
is completely different the tools the
precision and no one had this
technology. You are talking about a
pyramid. You know, a pyramid is a
project our modern machines and our
modern uh brains will stop uh uh as an
if you allow me to say as an idiot face
not able to understand how we can
achieve this project.
So, I'm fascinated in the image that you
showed us yesterday in the temple of
what looks like a helicopter.
>> Mhm.
>> And a submarine
>> and even dare I say some kind of
lenticular discshaped object.
>> Mhm.
>> What are they?
>> Um, I always explain that truly these
are two layers of writings. Okay. But my
question is always why? Why these two
layers? Why they picked up certain
samples to be put above each other
creating these shapes? It was not
random. These shapes are not coincidence
of a mistake or of a kind of art.
>> I mean the helicopter particularly, it's
a helicopter. It's not some other.
It's not a paridol. We're not mistaking
that image for something else.
>> It it's definitely a chopper. I agree
with you and that's why I'm saying it
was deliberately made in a very uh good
level of knowledge.
>> But but okay, I'm forgive me if I'm a
pedantic journalist. I want to pin you
down on this.
>> If it's a chopper,
>> how the hell did whoever rendered that
on a temple
>> in ancient Egypt, how the hell did they
know what a chopper looked like?
>> Uh don't forget, we talk about high
consciousness. These people developed uh
so many skills including brain
abilities. So their consciousness and
their um u uh abilities to receive and
maybe to see the future was different
from us. And and now this is important.
We think that the helicopter when it was
made that time it for them it was
future. Maybe it was a technology from
the best but we think it is future for
them. So, you think it might actually be
a relic, an image from a previous
civilization that also built helicopters
and submarines? It's just as plausible,
I suppose.
>> Uh, I I see it very possible.
>> Can I ask you this, Muhammad, and I
don't want you to get you into trouble
with your colleagues in Egypt, but do
you think that this possible alternative
history is being suppressed?
>> Yes. Yes. In a very strong way.
>> Why? I think they uh the people who put
the rules of Egyptology didn't um in the
beginning they didn't believe that there
is a kind of high technology can can do
this kind of work. They were uh
expecting uh the labors doing lots of uh
hand work, manual work, long time
primitive technique. But it happened
that we found that this is not correct.
Okay. But unfortunately these books, old
books and these uh uh history and PhDs
and so many of of these uh um uh
information became like a holy uh script
and and junior uh students now for
Egyptology are afraid to question this
information.
>> Has it been hard for you to be a bit of
a maverick taking the contrarian view?
Yes, it was very hard because uh you
have to to speak to hundreds and if you
convince one there are hundreds more are
are not following the same kind of
explanation.
>> Do you think it's possible that the
civilization that was here before this
human civilization was nonhuman?
>> Um maybe my own feeling no I feel
superior human civilization existed.
Okay. Uh, and by the way, I think they
were uh more than one civilization. They
were, in my opinion, hundreds of
civilizations.
>> You see a lot of the imagery in the the
walls, the hieroglyphs, the paintings,
>> these beautiful images. And I know a lot
of them are allegorical. They're telling
a story. Yes.
>> And they show reptilian heads. There's a
lot of reference to reptilians. There's
gigantic humans. There's giants. And
there are people with very large almost
swollen heads that I have to say are not
dissimilar to what we call the gray
aliens. You know,
is it possible that what we're talking
about is a a nonhuman intelligence that
was here before us?
>> I learned it a lesson a long time ago
not to say yes easily or no easily. So,
it is possible. Okay. But I'm telling
you what I believe and uh according to
some understanding that u many of these
figures are representing powers the mix
of the human power with the power of
alligators, falcons and and other
creatures as if the the human studied
these uh creatures in a very good way
and they reached the the level how to
develop their abilities, their
consciousness to get close to to these
creatures.
>> Do you think we'll ever know the real
story of what that civilization was in
ancient predestic Egypt?
>> I think we are uh getting uh close and
we are on the right path because uh I
started this business 24 years ago and I
can tell you the uh the the first uh
visitors I met at that time they didn't
pay attention to what we say now. But by
time over the years the number of
followers of so-called alternative
history is increasing and uh I started
with like five people later 500 now
thousands
>> it has been treated very much as a
fringe subject almost with a bit of
mockery and irony hasn't it
>> that yes but that was like 10 15 years
ago but now because of social media
because of all the the videos is showing
the truth so it became came like
accepted. Yes, it's still hard a little
bit, but believe me, so many people now,
so many officials, so many uh academics,
uh they have now big questions.
>> Well, I hope you're right, Muhammad.
