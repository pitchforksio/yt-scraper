Good day and welcome to Reality Check
Q&A. I'm your host, Ross Kulart. This is
the time when you get to ask me the hard
questions. And here to help me answer
them is my producer, colleague, and
friend Megan Order. Good day, Megan. How
was Greece? By the way, I know you were
across in the Greek islands of all
places. Lucky you. Yeah, Russ, it was it
was so beautiful. Such a beautiful place
and great to be there this time of year
because it's kind of off season for
tourism and travel. So, we had a nice
time.
>> Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And uh
are you going to hit me some questions
first or you going to tell me about your
holiday?
>> I think I'm going to tell you a little
about my holiday because Ross, while I
was there, I saw something very strange
in the skies and you are the first
person that I am telling my story to.
So, you're going to tell me that you've
seen a UAP?
>> Well, I'm not sure if I'm ready to call
it that. I will let you be the judge of
that since you are the professional
there. But I will tell you what I did
see. I'll set the scene. Um, we were in
Santorini. It was sunset time. We're
sitting outside um by the pool.
>> Q violin bottle of wine.
>> Bingo. Check. Check. Check. Um, and you
know, you're looking out over the ocean
trying to enjoy the beautiful sunset and
I off to the left of the sun see an orb.
I saw a white floating orb. Um, slow,
peaceful, um, moving in a very rhythmic
way. Um, and I watched it move and move
and move and then it just disappeared.
>> How far away?
>> Not very far. Um, it felt like it was it
was pretty close to us. It felt closer
to to shore than it did over the ocean
and also not very high. Um I'd say maybe
quarter mile in the sky.
>> So it was a quarter of a mile away. And
how far off the surface of the sea?
>> A quarter mile off the surface of the
sea. I'd say even about maybe the same
distance from me.
>> Okay. Okay. And uh how long did you
watch it for? I'm going to say about 15
to 20 seconds. Um, which feels long, but
it also could have been longer. You
know, I felt like I was totally
transfixed by this object. Um, watching
it move in such a slow rhythmic pattern.
>> Now, I know you're on holiday with your
husband. Did you Did he see it as well?
Did he have a Do you have a witness?
>> He did not see it, but he saw me seeing
it and he was looking at me like, "What
is this girl looking at?" So when I
finally kind of came too and after it
disappeared it felt it seemed like it
almost had a destination and when it got
to that destination then it then it took
off and disappeared from sight. Um so
when I kind of came too he you know I
looked over at him and he just said what
did you just see? And I go a UAP.
>> So when you say it took off are you
saying it accelerated fast faster than
it had been moving and took off out of
sight or
>> No. As in just it just disappeared just
gone.
>> Yeah. So it is just floating floating
floating
>> hit its target and then just
disappeared.
>> When you say it's hit its target, did it
go underwater?
>> No. Almost like this is going to sound
crazy, but you know, this is reality
checks. This is where we thrive in this
in this realm. Um
>> crazy.
>> We thrive off of off of what I'm about
to say. Um it was almost like it had um
a portal that it was tracking to and it
was like I'm I'm on my way. I'm on my
way. Okay. And then it's like, okay, now
I'm disappearing.
>> Wow.
>> It just disappear. It just disappeared
into thin air. Um, and I could not find
it anywhere. So then after I was like,
balloon, airplane, this, that, bird. And
I'm like, but then it just doesn't then
why did it how did it disappear like
that? How did it disappear? I'd be able
to track it if it was all those other
things.
>> So you you've gone through all the
possible prosaic explanations and you
can't think of anything that would fit
what you saw.
Um, no. An orb, an egg, I don't know. H
>> how how big was it if you were to I
mean, obviously it's a quarter of a mile
away, but how big was it? Do you
estimate?
>> Rather large. I would say the size of of
a ring light. Everyone has those now in
the in the digital age. Um, it felt like
about a large ring light.
>> What? Sorry, forgive me. From Australia.
What What's a ring light and how wide is
it?
Oh wow. Okay.
>> You know the rim lights that you put in
front of your camera um for good living
in television. You have one.
>> Oh right. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. Gotcha.
Okay. So that's pretty large. So maybe a
yard across. Three feet. Three feet
across.
>> Absolutely. Three feet.
>> Wow. Well, that's so that that's
extraordinary. So what what I guess we
should do and and if we're to be
professional about this is if there's
anyone else in Santorini, Greece who's
watching Reality Check who's had a
similar experience, Megan Arda is
looking for a corroborative witness.
That's that's great, Megan. Um just by
the way, I'm just wondering because I'm
I'm doing some work at the moment with
the idea of psionic connection, people
being able to connect psychically with
the phenomena. Did you get any sense at
all that the phenomena was there
specifically for you,
>> Russ? I did I did not feel that in the
moment, but I did feel
that peaceful sense of like this isn't
harmful. Like I wasn't scared in any
way. Again, I was almost transfixed by
it. I could not take my eyes off of it.
So, when it disappeared into thin air,
um I knew something was was funky with
it.
Well, I like the idea that it was
seeking you out to make you less
skeptical, Megan. So, this is this is
this is a turning point for reality
check. Wonderful. I love
>> they were like, "Tell Ross. Make sure
you tell Ross." So, I'm doing I'm doing
their bidding.
>> Okay. So, let's fire away. And and by
the way, if anybody does have any
similar sightings, particularly from
Santorini and Greece, we'd love to hear
from you. And so, especially would
Megan.
>> Yes. And I, you know, I'll throw up a
picture right now that a viewer did send
me on X of some similar orbs. These were
at night, so I think the images are
actually pretty pretty good. Um, my
sighting was, you know, there there was
still sunlight out, but just some more
images of different orbs that people are
seeing all around. But I will get into
our first question and now I'll we'll do
the viewers bidding. This comes in from
Simone. Hi Ross and Megan. Thank you for
providing grounded, fact checked,
highquality journalism on the UAP
paranormal topic. After listening to
your recent interview with Joshua, I'm
wondering if area 2 at Nellis Nuclear
Base is on land that used to be
inhabited and considered sacred by
Native Americans. I'm aware that some
sacred sites are rumored to have portals
and paranormal experiences like shadow
people attached to them. Eg. Skinwalker
Ranch. Love, Simone.
>> Hi, Simone. And I completely agree with
you. That is a very good angle to
explore and it's one that we did
actually explore in the story. We
started talking about the skinwalkers
from Skinwalker Ranch. I'm told that
yes, there is a Native American a strong
Native American connection to this
particular area and yes, shadow people
or shadow beings are part of that
mythology. Uh so yeah, maybe that's what
they saw. Um I just don't know. We've
had a huge reaction to Joshua's uh
interview. Uh and it's interesting
because a lot of people It's
interesting. A lot of people are saying,
well, you know, he's just another person
making anecdotal claims. And it's not
anecdotal at all. It's a direct
firsterson witness who has provided
testimony to the Federal Bureau of
Investigations. And moreover, I can tell
you his testimony is corroborated by at
least two other witnesses that the FBI
are reaching out to. So this is a
well-corroborated triple corroorated
story of odd paranormal going on at one
of the most sensitive nuclear
installations in the world. And um I I I
do think yes, the possibility that this
paranormal explanation might be shadow
beings of some kind in accordance with
Native American mythology is a very
plausible possible explanation.
>> All right, another question on the Yosua
interview. This is from Katherine. Hi
Megan and Ross. My question is around
the excellent interview Ross conducted
with Yosua Shelton. Do you think the
shadow figure spotted at Area 2 and
other nuclear sites are remote viewers?
Best wishes from the UK.
>> It's funny, you know, I've never heard
of remote viewers manifesting
physically. Um my It's funny, I was only
talking to somebody about this last
night. There's um remote viewing is
somebody remotely perceiving a location,
but they're not geoloccating. They're
not they're not basically taking their
corperial body there. I don't know a
lot. I don't pretend to know a lot about
remote viewing, but one thing that's
quite interesting is a number of remote
viewers, and if you read the history of
the Stargate program, a number of remote
viewers have related how when they've
been remote viewing a site and there's
an alleged non-human entity there. They
somehow perceive the nonhumans there.
The nonhumans perceive the the human
there. Uh, but I don't think that when
you're remote viewing, you're physically
manifesting a representation of yourself
to whatever or whoever is in the
location. I I think that essentially
it's a transfer of consciousness, if
it's anything at all. And essentially
it's an ability to geo uh remotely
perceive a location. Uh, and I I don't
think that the person is manifested in
any way on that location. So I don't
think it could be somebody who was
remote viewing area 2. No.
>> Okay. We will go to a question from
Chris on X. Hi Megan, how are you hun? I
am good. Can you ask Ross what his
thoughts are on NASA cutting the live
feed from Mars when three Atlas went
past? Everything was going well. Then
they turned into a gray screen. What are
they hiding?
>> You know, it's funny. I never believed
any of the NASA conspiracy theories
until very very recently. I always
thought it was nonsense that NASA cut
the feed. And I now realize someone is
cutting the feed because I've seen it.
I've actually seen it happen. Um I can't
comment one way or the other about the
three eye atlas feed being cut because
frankly I just don't know if it was. I I
I assume that there was a disruption.
And look, disruptions do happen to
transmissions. Obviously, it's a big
thing to be able to receive or send a a
transmission across space. So, it
wouldn't surprise me at all if
occasionally there are disruptions. But
I'll tell you my story, which I have
told before, but I was um invited uh to
tour as a VIP the Marshall Space Center
when I was giving a speech at the
Huntsville Scientific Coalition for the
Study of UAPs two years ago. And it was
a great opportunity and I remain very
grateful to the local director of NASA
on location who very kindly ushered me
around with the wife of another former
NASA administrator Mike Griffin. And
while we were on location in the viewing
room where there's a huge bank of video
feeds from the space station, the
International Space Station, um we were
looking at the feeds with the director
of the Marshall Space Center talking to
me uh with his back to those screens.
And there's the control room for the
receiving of signals and control of the
space station to my right that we're
looking at through this glass window.
And as he's talking to me, Rebecca
nudges me and goes, "Look." And there
are maybe eight or nine eggshaped
objects moving from behind the space
station. And the camera is pointed out
into interstellar space, and you see
these egg-shaped objects just tracking
along in formation very, very slowly.
And I very naively ask the director of
the Marshall Space Center, is, "Excuse
me, sir. Is are they Starlink
satellites? Has somebody just released
Starlink satellites?" And he turns,
looks at the feed, sees the objects, and
then he looks through the window into
the main control room and they flick a
switch and they do it right in front of
us. Transmission to the space station
has been interrupted. Now, I I don't
know what happened. I'm not suggesting
any sinister motive on the part of the
director of the Marshall Space Center,
but I saw it happen and so did two other
people, including the wife of a former
NASA administrator. So, it happened. And
the the thing that interested me was it
almost seemed to be routine.
And when I went back to try and look at
feeds to see if I could find what I'd
seen, it wasn't there. So, I've seen a
disruption to the feed and it made me
feel very very uncomfortable. What I was
seeing was clearly anomalous to people
in the room and uh I never got an
explanation. The um the director went
and he had to move on because he was
committed on other tasks. But I never
got an explanation for what that was,
which remains profoundly interesting. As
for the 3i Atlas uh video feed
disruption, I didn't see it happen. I
don't know anything about it, but I can
tell you I've seen strange disruptions
to the feeds, the video feeds through
NASA.
>> All right, very interesting. We will go
to another question from X. Hi, Megan.
Please, could you ask Ros these
so-called drones cannot be tracked back
to source with all the modern
technology? It baffles me. Kind regards,
Neil in Yorkshire. That is the $99
million question. I find it utterly
baffling that we have spent literally
billions, trillions of dollars on
defense, particularly in Western Europe,
which of course is the forward line
against any Russian offensive that might
take place. And so an enormous amount of
money has been spent on basically
counter UAS technology, counter air
technology. You know, we we're basically
meant to have the top air surveillance
technology in the world. You're telling
me that we cannot in any way follow,
track, or detect these drones, supposed
drones, when they appear, it just
doesn't wash to me. And I really do
think now that we know that these
sightings are continuing, including in
Santorini, Greece clearly. But now that
we know that these objects are still
manifesting themselves over Western
Europe, it's still going on. There's
still no explanation. There's still no
admission from anyone in authority that
they have any idea what these objects
are. They've not been able to track
them. They've not been able to follow
them.
It It's just a baffling mystery. And
what I find extraordinary is these
stories happen as they happened in New
Jersey, continental United States last
year. They come and then the mainstream
media forgets about the issue and moves
on and everybody goes, "Oh yeah, yeah,
what about that drone issue a few years
ago?" And it's never explained. I am
told that this is an ongoing mystery
that has not been resolved. It's an
issue of huge concern. The explanation
that it's the Russians is the default
explanation purely and simply because
they have no bloody idea. And the
interesting thing is the Russians have
categorically denied it as they would of
course if they were doing this.
One of the possibilities in my head
still is that this might be highly
advanced Chinese technology. That the
Chinese have made some kind of
technological breakthrough that allows
them to have droneike objects loitering
on position for many hours on end with
no visible means of propulsion and
obviously highly stealth capabilities
that allow them not to be tracked or
detected. But really there's no evidence
for that. Uh why would the Chinese do
that? I guess I'm just speculating that
maybe they're trying to provoke some
kind of a a conflict between the the
West and the East, but really nobody has
any idea. And I find that absolutely
fascinating when you consider the
trillions of dollars that every nation
is spending on national defense. You
seriously tell me that we cannot follow
a solid drone-like object hovering over
a civil or military aviation facility of
great national security sensitivity.
This is a disgrace. And I I think also
the fact that a lot of the mainstream
media is failing to realize the
significance of the admissions being
made by official. I mean, the most
recent comments from the Denmark
authorities and indeed from Norway are
that they really truly have no idea what
these objects are. They haven't been
able to track them or follow them. Yes,
there's been technology brought in for
quite some time now. American, German
technology brought in to try and track
and bring down these objects. There's
been no public statement made about what
these objects are or whether there's
been any successful tracking, detection,
or shootown. I find that just absolutely
extraordinary. What does it say about
the fact that something someone is able
to operate over the most sensitive
military and civilian facilities in
Western Europe and indeed across the
continental United States and the United
Kingdom with complete impunity.
I I for the life of me do not understand
why that is not a major national
security issue. And I appreciate the
news has been pretty busy right now with
the news in the Middle East, but have
have you noticed how quickly the story
dropped off the front page and how
quickly so much of the mainstream media
stopped covering it? One thing I can
assure you is we are not going to let go
of the issue on Reality Check or News
Nation. We continue to ask the hard
questions
>> like a dog with a bone, right, Ross?
>> Absolutely. All right, here comes Shai
um bouncing off of what you just said.
Do you think that the current
administration will truly get its hands
dirty with disclosure with Middle East
issues coming to certain closure, Trump
searching Nobel Prize, and Rubio called
quote greatest secretary of state in
history? Would they really take a risk
with this issue even with all the
testimonies made to Congress?
>> Okay, I think the bigger risk is not
disclosing. The bigger risk is the
public discovers very soon, eventually
inevitably that they've been lied to for
decades. Does Trump, does President
Trump want to be the president to
presided over the continuing cover up? I
can tell you that there are people in
his administration and in his family who
want disclosure. And I I do think
there's a push back by the national
security state and the intelligence
community. the number of intelligence
community bots that try and meddle with
the comments in our program in reality
check and the numerous bots that try and
infest social media commentary are
becoming so conspicuous and so obvious
they use denigration, attack, ridicule,
contempt, anything to try and shut down
the story and it's not working because
the public want answers. I've never had
a story before as a journalist that is
so high-profile, so highly visible.
People really care about this issue.
>> Right here is Gonzalo from X. Ross has
hinted he's going to Peru. Has he
thought about seeing the non-human
tridactyl corpses available for research
at the university at the University of
Inca?
>> Great question. Yes, I am going to Peru,
Bolivia, and Easter Island in about
three or four weeks. Really excited to
do that. that I host tours occasionally.
I was in Egypt last year and yes, I will
be bringing you whatever I can from
Bolivia, Peru, and Easter Island on the
megalithic mysteries there, including I
hope on a story related to the
tridactyls. I've been in touch with
Tierry Yamin, who's one of the more
prominent investigators into this issue,
and yes, I do hope to bring you
something on this, I hope, relatively
soon.
>> All right, another question from Access
from Demon Watch. Any comment on Jason
Stan's claims that humans are a slave
race and our governments are controlled
by NHI?
>> Look, I have to say I don't know how
Jason knows that. I've spoken
extensively to Jason. It's not something
that he ever told me that he knew from
any of his work. So, if this is
something that he's recently revealed, I
haven't heard him say this. It's not
something that he told me as a
journalist in his very early days. I'm
not saying it's not true. It's just that
one of the things you look for when you
are testing people's allegations and
claims is whether what they're revealing
is something that they've known in the
course of their work or whether it's
something that they're speculating about
that they just think happened or that
they've been informed about. I'd just
like to see more rigorous questioning to
get to the bottom of why he says what he
says.
>> Okay, here is Dharma Lion. Hi Ross. Have
you looked into scientist Amy Escridg's
possibly suspicious death and her
anti-gravity research and comments on
disclosure with your recent coverage of
triangular anti-gravidic craft? Who are
the scientists working on this? Thanks.
Keep up the great great work. Jamie,
>> I actually spoke to Amy Escri. I I um I
don't think she killed herself. I I do
think there's a very high likelihood she
was murdered. Um, I've got a very good
friend who was a very, very good friend
of hers who was being sent emails by her
in the months prior to her death where
she genuinely feared that somebody was
trying to hurt her or kill her. And I've
seen I've got photographs, harrowing
photographs of burns that she allegedly
suffered from some kind of directed
energy weapon that she believes was
directed at her from the street through
the window of the office that she was
working in. And they are harrowing
images showing burns on her hands where
literally there's a a red mark that
starts just from her hands and it it's
as if her hands across a keyboard were
being irradiated with something. Um, I I
do think that the instance of the Amy
Escridge case is quite extraordinary.
There's a whole lot of unexplained
stuff. The difficulty is that her body
was apparently cremated shortly after
her death. Her family and I have no wish
to cause her family any hurt. Her family
do uh I understand believe that she
committed suicide. Um, I don't want to
speak for the family or purport to speak
for the family because it's always a
tragedy when anyone loses a loved one.
The the terrible thing is there was no
full coronial inquiry. I I did make
inquiries with local police about why
there wasn't going to be a full coronial
inquiry and it was because of the
finding of suicide. Um, I I feel very
sad about the Amy Escridge death. She
was a brilliant woman. She was at times
unstable. She was a big drinker. Um, but
I don't think she killed herself. I
truly don't think she killed herself.
Uh, I'm sorry if that upsets the family,
but I think she was a wonderful human
being. Um, she was making claims that
she was making advances in anti-gravitic
technology and propulsion systems. And
of course, her father was is I'm not
sure if he still is a senior NASA
engineer. Um it's a great tragedy that
she was lost. She was a beautiful,
brilliant young woman. And yes, she's
one of multiple scientists I I I have
spoken to or am speaking to who purport
to be working on alternative propulsion
systems. That's an area that I am
exploring. If anyone wants to tell me
any more about Amy or indeed anything
about alternative propulsion systems
that might explain the weird and
anomalous objects in our skies, I'm
always happy to hear from you.
>> Okay, we have an email from Cal Ross. Is
there any new information on the
September 10th, 2025 incident where a
Hellfire missile bounced off an ORB UAP?
Everyone, even the legacy media, covered
it, but still haven't heard back if it
was analyzed and verified as real
footage, not CGI or AI. No info on how
high off the ocean seen zooming past.
Field of view, if it was slow-mo or real
time. I still doubt it's real as the
hellfire wanders in and out. Doesn't
detonate. Very suspect in my honest
opinion. Disturbing either way, real or
not. Thanks, Cal.
>> Look, I'm told the reason it didn't
detonate, Cal, is because it wasn't an
explosive charge. It was one of those um
horrible flail weapons where it
basically flails into an object with
blades and cuts the object to par. And I
have to be honest with you, that to me
suggests that maybe the object was is a
balloon. But what puzzles me is why
there's been no official comment to
explain this. It would be very very easy
for Congress to ask specific questions
of the defense department about that
video and get a very quick answer. And I
don't think we should jump to
conclusions. Uh I would also like to see
the rest of the imagery. There's
apparently more seconds of imagery that
complete that image that might provide
an answer for us. Um, what frustrates me
again is this is Congress asking
questions, legitimate questions about a
video that has been leaked, I presume,
to them from someone who was concerned
that this video potentially showed
something anomalous. That should be
investigated. Congress should be given
an explanation. And if Congress isn't
given explanation, then we have to ask
why. Who is running America?
This is a government of the people, for
the people, by the people. Congress is
essentially sovereign under American
constitutional democracy. It should have
the right to ask questions. And what I'm
really heartened about is that
chairperson Anna Paulina Luna of the
transparency committee subcommittee and
the oversight committee, she's actually
now apparently moving forward to ask
interrogatories of potentially hostile
witnesses in the defense department and
intelligence community who may not want
to answer questions. And this is one of
those questions we should be getting
answered. It it really is time for
Congress to start getting clever. I I
don't mean to detract from the
significance of the recent UAP hearing
because like everyone else, I enjoy
seeing the UAP subject being given a
high public profile by our elected
political representatives. But I do
think it's time for Congress to take the
gloves off and start asking the hard
questions. Let's subpoena Admiral Thomas
Wilson, who by the way is a good man, a
former J2 in the Defense Department, who
allegedly, and I'm saying pretty surely,
did uh respond to questions from Dr.
Eric Davis that comprise the so-called
um uh Wilson documents, which
essentially describe his efforts to try
and investigate the legacy retrieval
reverse engineering program. Why was a
deputy director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency threatened with his
job if he continued investigating
whether or not there was this retrieval
reverse engineering legacy program with
UAPs?
Let's call some of these witnesses.
Let's bring them in under duress if
necessary. Let's do it first in a skiff
if that's required to protect some
sensitive national security issues. But
let's get answers to these questions,
including these unexplained images of
anomalous objects, potentially anomalous
objects, because frankly, I can't answer
your question because we don't have any
further information. That's the simple
answer. There has been no further
information. The Defense Department does
what it always does, which is refuse to
answer public questions. And while we're
at it, we're actually in a very grim
time right now with the Pentagon. Um,
sadly, Defense Secretary Pete Hgsith has
brought in laws or proposed changes
which would essentially require media to
prevet whatever they get from people in
the defense department with the defense
department. And that's antithetical, I
think, to good journalism. And I'm
really pleased to see all of the major
networks are refusing to comply with
that expectation. And as a result,
they're having their Pentagon
accreditation removed.
Sadly, I I I've got every respect for
people in uniform. I have no doubt that
we are in need of protecting national
security secrets. But good journalism is
often part of that process. And I've
spoken to many generals, intelligence
officials who respect and understand why
the media need to ask questions. It's a
good, healthy part of a functioning
democracy. In the past, it's exposed
things that should be exposed. war
crimes,
failures, equipment mismanagement, that
kind of thing's important. They need to
be exposed. And you just have to ask,
why is the defense department not asking
answering basic questions about UAPs?
And why is the mainstream media for the
main just so willingly complacent and
compliant in refusing to push and to
keep on pushing for answers to those
questions? I I just think it's a
disgrace. It really is a a disgrace the
way the mainstream media allow
themselves to be supinely tickled on the
tummy by defense and intelligence
officials who feed them stories and they
just don't see the obvious stories
sitting right under their nose. I mean,
just coming back to the drone issue for
a moment, by any measure, if you're a
national security correspondent, a
defense correspondent, what is going on
at the moment over the continent of the
United States, across Western Europe and
the United Kingdom, is a national
security disgrace. There are objects
that are with apparent impunity
breaching the airspace of highly
sensitive civil and military, national
security installations.
The governments of those countries don't
have answers. Why not? And why is the
public not getting answers? And more
importantly, why is so much of the
mainstream media not pushing for an
answer? That that's the big question.
>> Okay, Ross, thank you so much. That will
do it for today.
>> Well, have we gone half an hour? That's
amazing.
>> It flies by.
>> I I want a full drawing of your sphere.
Uh, one thing I was going to ask you is
when you say it was white, was it pure
white or was it translucently pearly
white? Like were there colors white
moving with it?
>> No, I didn't see any any color movement.
