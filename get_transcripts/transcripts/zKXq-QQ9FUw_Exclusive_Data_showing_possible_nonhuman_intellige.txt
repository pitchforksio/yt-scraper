Well, good day and welcome to this
special reality check news update.
There's so much happening in UAPology at
the moment and frankly we were thinking
that it's important to get these two
major news stories up on the agenda as
quickly as possible. First off, Dr.
Beatatric Viller. You may recall a few
weeks back came on reality check and
told us about the work that she's been
doing on the so-called transient objects
in geostationary earth orbit which she
in a new in a couple of new papers
suggested were in fact artificial
reflective constructed objects. It was
and remains a momentous paper and the
reason we're bringing Beatric back today
is because there's been a new
development. Beatrice, welcome to
Reality Check.
>> What's happening? What's the news?
>> Uh, well, there actually some good news.
So, we had two papers that were
exciting. one about the transient UFO
and new connection um by Steven Brew and
myself and the second paper where we are
searching for NHI artifacts by looking
for things that look like um um solar
reflections
and uh like and satellites in presputnik
images and both these two papers have
now passed peer review and they are
accepted for they are accepted for
publication in fact they are published
So they got published um on Monday now.
>> Wow. So you have now two papers on UAPs
published as peer-reviewed papers in
which journals?
>> So one is uh scientific report and that
belongs to the nature journals and the
second is publications of the
astronomical society of the pacific
passp uh and it's a good astronomy
journal.
Th this is momentous Beatatrice. I know
how hard it is to get anything on UAP's
past peer review. You've basically got
an article which has survived the
scrutiny of all of the peer review
experts. essentially an article
suggesting that there are artificial
constructed objects that were reflective
specular in Earth orbit before humans
sent up objects into space.
>> Exactly. So, it's fun. It's very
exciting to have these.
>> Now, you were expecting to get shot
down, weren't you? You were expecting
quite an aggressive um response from
debunkers and peer reviewers. Was it a
tough was it a tough go to get through
the peer review? It was really tough for
this paper with um um NHI artifacts but
the referee was constructive and curious
and I think that's the golden thing when
you are talking like talking to a
curious person they do propose good
tests and you can try and you can check
so it was uh difficult challenging but
great I enjoyed
>> congratulations I mean I it's very rare
to get anything relating to UFOs UAPs
these unidentified objects into a
peer-reviewed journal, especially
journals as prestigious as the ones
you're talking about. Let me do a quick
summary. So the study that you did, you
were looking at pre-satellite transient
sky events and you basically analyzed
nearly 300,000
short-lived transient events that were
captured on red sensitive photographic
plates from the first Paloma sky survey.
And these exposures were all taken
between 1948 and before humans put
satellites up in the late 1950s. And
each of these exposures lasted about
4550 minutes. And you focused on
identifying cases where three or more
transient points appeared along a
straight line during the same exposure.
And the the reason why those lines
matter is if a single flash appears on a
sky plate, it could be a glitch. But
multiple pointlike lights perfectly
aligned and visible in one long exposure
photo that hints at something
coordinated, possibly spinning or
reflective objects. And you can rule out
natural sources like meteors, stars, and
asteroids. They don't line up and appear
simultaneously. You can rule out now
plate defects because you were able to
show, weren't you? as you told us
previously that um uh when you go into
the shadow of the sun uh obviously it
removes the reflectiveness. So clearly
it's it's um not a plate defect. Um and
you basically what the the only
plausible explanation is artificial
reflections from flat highly reflective
surfaces in geoynchronous
orbit. That's that's exactly what
explains you're talking about how many
of these objects are we talking about
Beatric.
>> So we had two candidates that are highly
interesting that the paper resulted in
uh and uh there's still one little
caveat for these two candidates. There's
a minuscal chance that it might be some
something called optical ghosting on the
in the instruments. Um, what speaks
against it is because we looked we at
the blue sensitive images and you don't
see anything there. If it would be
optical ghosting, you would also see
with the same setup of the instruments,
you would see something there. But we
don't. However, we always always leave
that little caveat. But what even more
uh talks about that these things are
real is because when we look at all the
transients, not only at the line ones,
but all the transits in the Earth
shadow, we do see this huge deficit of
transients. And that really speaks for
that what we are dealing with are solar
reflections from very flat uh very
reflective objects in geocynchronous
orbits.
>> Doctor, tell me what could this be? What
are these objects?
>> Well, these are uh objects before
Sputnik one when humans have nothing up
there. And these things no matter what
they are, they need to be really frat
reflective like a mirror. And I
personally don't know anything natural
that produces
and that looks like that that fulfills
these requirements.
>> And am I correct in saying there are
literally tens of thousands of these
objects that you've detected?
>> We see uh that roughly 35,000 transients
are belonging to this kind of category.
But that is just for the northern
hemisphere which means that we would
need to have around 70,000 of transients
around I mean for the whole earth and
from that we can estimate that um maybe
tens of thousands to 100 thousands of
objects around the earth must have been
there.
>> Now we know that they were there in
presputnik 1950s.
>> What do we know about whether they're
still there? Can we rule out the
possibility or the probability that
they're still there in geocynchronous
orbit?
>> I have no idea because if these are what
I think they are, I mean, if these are
artificial objects which the signatures
are pointing towards, I have no idea
what they could have done or if they are
there still. I would assume they're
there still. But it's a reasonable
conclusion, isn't it, doctor? That if
these are artificial objects,
>> yes,
>> some civilization has constructed them.
>> Yes, I would say so. I mean, it's not
ours.
>> And when your when your peerreview
colleagues asked you questions, were
they aware of the significance of what
this paper is these papers are pointing
to?
>> I don't know. We were talking about the
technicalities, not about the
implications. It's interesting because
scientists get bogged down obviously for
good reason in exploring alternative
prosaic explanations, but when you think
about it and step back from the
implications of what you're saying,
>> this is massive. You you are the author
or the lead author of two papers which
essentially suggest that there are
artificial constructed objects in
geocynchronous earth orbit in the 1950s
before humans sent up satellites. And to
this day we don't know if those objects
are still there but they are indicative
of
something constructed.
Isn't that exciting?
>> Good for you. I mean, the implications
are this might be the first scientific
evidence of a non-human intelligence.
And it certainly is going to be uh what
I like about this is that we are giving
exact methods and strategies for people
to explore the UFO question and the
question if they are here through just
uh easily available methods that many
astronomers over the whole world can
work with because these plate archives
exist in so many countries and you don't
need to be part of some very expensive
big collaboration because if you have
access to is open data. Anyone can go
in, they can analyze these data sets,
they can u download them and they can
check if there's a deficit in the earth
shadow or if they see alignments is a
very open uh source way of working. So I
think yes we are going to be able uh to
really pin down a very secure answer
very soon if more people try to
replicate this and work with the same
questions and methods.
What's the reaction from your astronomer
colleagues? Are people aware yet that
these these papers are accepted for
peer-reviewed publication?
>> I guess they are finding out these days.
It will be exciting to follow.
>> But I mean this is momentous, isn't it?
I mean I I explain to our audience
please what what is the significance of
getting peer reviewed on a paper like
this?
Well uh so the peerreview process exists
to remove like
errors that are that someone can notice
like errors uh and but also like logical
flaws and to have a discussion like
different perspectives. It could could
it could it be that and so the peer
review process is very important from
that perspective. Traditionally it has
also been very it has been a way of also
stopping unorthodox ideas unfortunately.
So the peer review has not only good
things, it also has bad things because
if you have something that is very new
and unique, then you have the um you
you're going to hit into a wall. And now
uh there's a big stigma around the UAP
topic which has made that most papers
don't even go into peer review. They get
rejected at the editor's desk. So now we
have these two new papers and they have
done uh uh passed the peer review have
been published now and that means that
um
they passed the quality checks of course
and now and it's different journals and
actually there's also a third paper that
was published now in the beginning of
August. So we have three papers on this
topic with the ET probes and UAPs around
the earth uh that are all published in
different journals and with different
processes and
I think it's very good. It's a very good
uh big step.
>> Now Beatric, I'm going to invite you to
do something that scientists don't
normally do.
>> I want I want you to speculate.
There's obviously there's obviously
something that you've captured that was
there in the 1950s.
What do you think it might be? What's
your in your mind a plausible
explanation for what those objects might
be?
>> So, there are different plausible
explanations. One is maybe that there is
something we don't know about the human
civilization and maybe maybe we had a
few rounds already and uh Maybe there's
a prior human civilization that was
wiped out as people like Graeme Hancock
talk about, you know, the younger Dus 12
and a half thousand years ago.
>> Maybe there was a prior human
civilization and a lot of these
megalithic monuments we see on the
planet are in fact remnants of a
previous possibly human civilization.
That That's a good one. uh an
alternative explanation
>> maybe nonhuman probes that are um that
were sent here like Patrick Jackson he
has this beautiful uh suggestion of a
surveillance network and I think that
kind of it looks very logical if you
have another civilization that is
capable of constructing these probes why
wouldn't they send here lots of them
so that's a possibility
>> we're actually just so our audience know
we're going to be bringing Patrick on
the show very soon. I've been talking to
Patrick for quite some time and we're
we're going to be doing an interview
with him talking about his theory, his
hypothesis that essentially these
metallic spheres that are being seen all
over the planet are some kind of Earth
monitoring or defense system by a
possible nonhuman intelligence
civilization that's keeping an eye on
the planet. You probably are a very big
science fiction buff, aren't you,
Beatatrice? some
>> I used to be used to be but not so much
anymore and I do I must admit in the
past I love to watch Doctor Who but the
latest seasons didn't work for me.
>> No, me neither. Me neither. But but what
what I do like from Arthur C. Clark is
the notion of the sentinel and uh
obviously that was the inspiration for
the movie Space Odyssey 2001. the idea
that when humans discovered a sentinel
constructed by a non-human civilization
on the moon, it activated uh the
beginning of an opening of awareness of
human consciousness. I mean, wow.
Wouldn't it be incredible if the
discovery of this possibly
constructed artificial objects in
geostationary Earth orbit was the
trigger for something amazing in
humanity?
It would be amazing and I hope it u
brings humanity closer to each other
because we I mean we are living in times
when there's so much of geopolitical
instability but we need to stop fighting
in between each other and start
embracing humanity and protecting humans
because we are not alone here probably
as I as far as I see it I think we never
were alone and then we need to just
collaborate
try to find peace in the best possible
way.
>> So, Beatric,
the the implications of this have not
really to date in your previously um
published papers, they haven't been
picked up by mainstream media. Does the
fact that you now have peer review, that
your peers have assessed your papers as
legitimate for publication in a
prestigious scientific journal, does
that have an impact, do you think, on
the likelihood that the rest of the
mainstream media will pick it up and run
with it?
>> I think it's um bigger probability, but
maybe mainstream media when they see the
news, they're still going to be a little
bit scared because I think the stigma
exists everywhere. It's not only in the
scientific journals. It's also exist uh
in the I mean in various news outlets
people look at it and say oh can it
really be this looks a little crazy. So
I think you're going to find the stigma
everywhere but maybe there's a bigger
probability that some mainstream media
will look at it now. So, how categorical
are you in your mind that these objects,
these tens of thousands of objects in
geostationary earth orbit are
constructed objects, artificial objects?
>> I mean, nature can always surprise us
with something we could never have
imagined. So, I cannot exclude that
there might be some other explanation
that is just outside my imagination. But
from what I see, I cannot I cannot find
any other consistent explanation than
that we are looking at something
artificial before spotnik one.
>> There's absolutely no doubt that the
National Security Agency of the United
States, the um National Geospatial
Intelligence Agency, they have
satellites in Earth orbit which could be
used to look at objects in geostationary
orbit. The heat should be put on NASA
and the various US government
intelligence and defense agencies that
have the capacity to investigate this
area of space. They have cameras that
could quite easily look at geostationary
Earth orbit and resolve this mystery for
us very quickly, couldn't they?
>> I think it would be amazing if they
could help us with this. Another thing,
imagine if you could go there with a big
net and just pick up all the objects you
can find from the geocynchronous and you
take it down here.
>> So, how far out is geocynchronous orbit?
It's several hundred miles, isn't it?
>> Uh, well, we are looking here at 42,000
kilometers.
>> Oh, wow. Gosh, 42,000 km from the Earth.
That shows my level of understanding.
So, it's quite a way away from the
Earth, but but still visible with some
of the orbital telescopes that we have.
>> Absolutely.
>> Well, Dr. Beatatric Viller, thank you so
much for joining us here on Reality
Check and congratulations on achieving
peer review on such a stigmatized and
often ridiculed subject. I actually
think this is quite an historic moment
to see somebody of your reputation as an
astronomer being able to get papers
accepted for peer review in uh
prestigious scientific journals. Many
many congratulations. Well done. Where
do you go to next? What what's the next
inquiry you'd like to do?
So um we're still working with the for
example the exopro project and like we
want to expand on that like adding a
telescope and uh try to construct our
own lists uh of uh mystery transients
that might exist today and see how
like the difference in number from how
many we can see in the photographic
plates versus how many we can see today
because that can help us to understand
uh the contribution ution of humans uh
to this total number.
>> Well, either way uh what you've achieved
to date is momentous. I think it's quite
historic and thank you so much for
bringing it to us on reality check.
Thank you so much,
>> Beatric Viller.
>> Thanks.
Okay, so a few weeks back, you may
recall we interviewed Canadian
journalist Daniel Otus about what's been
going on in Canada. One of the big
issues that I'm fascinated with is
whether Canadian scientists have
collaborated with any American
scientists on the legacy UAP retrieval
and reverse engineering program. And the
history of this query comes from a
letter that a Canadian MP member of
parliament Larry Maguire wrote to the
Canadian defense minister about two or
three years ago because he had a tip
that there were indeed collaborations
between uh Canadian scientists and
American scientists on retrieved
material. On the 22nd of March 2023, he
wrote to the Canadian Defense Minister
Anand stating that Canada's Defense
Research and Development Canada
organization, the DRDC,
has participated in efforts to analyze
UAP, which is publicly traceable to
circa 1950. This recovered material, he
said, is studied through the Five Eyes
Foreign Material Program, the FMP, which
in Canada is sponsored by the Canadian
Forces Intelligence Command, aligned
with several intelligence sharing
arrangements and treaties. Now, that was
quite an important allegation by Mr.
Maguire, who's since left Parliament.
And we did put questions at the time of
the Daniel Otus interview to Larry
Magcguire so that we could include them
in that interview. Unfortunately, he
didn't get back to us in time, but he's
now responded and I think it's important
to put his answers on the public record.
So, he has conceded in his answer to me
that it is possible there are other
arrangements and collaborations beyond
the five eyes foreign material program.
Uh the minister came back of course and
categorically denied that it was part of
the DRDC
the um uh the defense research and
development Canada organization. And so
the big question that's not resolved in
her answer is whether what Canada's been
doing is being done through the opaces
of some other government agency. And so
Larry Magcguire said, even though I'm no
longer an an MP, if if I could get my
sources to who are willing to meet, be
willing to meet with current members of
parliament and staff, it could help
consolidate information and do an
exchange of notes. And I will ask my
sources. I've got people who've told me
that Canada is collaborating with US
scientists, and a lot of them, frankly,
are just terrified. Uh what Larry says
is what's needed is more collaboration
across countries and legislative bodies
which I warmly warmly acknowledge. Um
one of the other things that I asked him
was um
do you accept the categorical response
from the minister that the Canadian
armed forces uh have never had any
possession of UAP materials? and he
says, "I just don't think the minister
or defense officials took my letter
seriously, nor investigated its
contents. If they were serious, you'd
think the minister of or someone from
her office would have reached out to try
and start a conversation." Make no
mistake, he says, "The stigma and taboo
of this topic still exists, which is
part of the reason why so few people
want to engage." Another intriguing
answer he gave me and I asked him, "How
sure are you of the American sources
that told you of this collaboration
between Canadian scientists and American
scientists?" And he said they weren't
American. He noted that the minister
didn't even acknowledge that the that
Canada is part of the foreign material
program, which to the best of my
knowledge has never been publicly
acknowledged by anyone in Canada. For
some reason, the simple fact that Canada
participates for legitimate reasons that
go beyond this issue is not openly
acknowledged. I'm not aware of the
rationale behind it. Um, I also asked
him if it's possible that Canadian
scientists were secounded from their
roles in defense or intelligence to a
private US aerospace corporation with
offices in Canada. And the reason I
asked that question is because that's
what I've been told. and he said,
"That's certainly a possibility. I've
never encountered this specific claim
and no one's presented that information
to me before." I asked him, "Do you
believe the minister's statement that
neither the Defense Department nor the
Canadian Forces Intelligence Command are
or were involved in any type of formal
analysis of UAP and that all formal
efforts to study UAP ceased in Canada in
the 1960s."
and he said to me, "This is where
government departments often play fast
and loose with definitions. It's hard to
believe that no analysis has been done
since then. The real question is what's
been happening over all these decades
and why no one has spoken publicly about
it." That was one of the reasons why I
pushed the chief science adviser to
produce the Sky Canada project. It's
also worth noting that the Department of
National Defense was far from helpful in
cooperating with this Guy Canada team.
Um, I just want to get a lot of what
Larry said on the record. So, forgive me
for being a bit of a penant to make sure
I get all his answers.
What is your personal view? I asked him
on the broad question of whether there's
been a historical cover up of what
governments know about UAPs, especially
some of the five eyes nations like
Canada, the US, and UK. He said, quote,
"There have been far too many people,
many with impeccable credentials who've
spoken either publicly or privately
about the existence of highly sensitive
information. Either every single one of
them is lying or there is something
happening that deserves attention. It's
easy to dismiss one or two individuals,
but when multiple credible voices raise
the same concerns, even within the
limits of non-disclosure or
confidentiality agreements, the
responsibility shifts to policy makers
in the press to pursue the truth. Each
year, more people seem to take an
interest in the subject, quietly
following along and weighing what they
hear. I see this topic, he says, like
any other issue that demands public
policy change. Building a case takes
time. There are stakeholders, including
a growing number of organizations and
loosely connected groups. There are
activists who use social media and
podcasts to raise awareness and push the
conversations forward. And there is the
media which is trying to sort fact from
speculation while competing for public
attention. Naturally, this creates
tension and debate as some participants
are deeply passionate and convinced they
know the answer while others are
cautious. These discussions can be messy
and patience is required. What matters
most, he says, is that people stay
engaged and open to where the evidence
leads. Keep asking questions and don't
be afraid to pop your head up. And I
guess the most interesting question I
asked him was with the benefit of
hindsight, do you believe now that the
US and possibly other countries have
been involved in the recovery of exotic
potentially nonhuman technology and are
secretly involved in reverse engineering
efforts. And he said, "That's the
million-doll question. I honestly don't
know what we're dealing with. There are
so many theories and possibilities. My
instinct is that the truth, whatever it
may be, will not be as clear-cut as
everyone hopes. On the balance of
probabilities, there is clearly
something there that companies and
individuals within governments want to
keep secret. The reasons for the secrecy
are harder to pin down. Perhaps they've
lied for so long they can't untangle the
situation without damaging their
credibility. Perhaps public funds were
misused. Perhaps the information is so
disruptive that it would overturn
political agendas or unsettled global
markets. Or it may be that they fear
revealing it could give foreign
adversaries an advantage. Hull putoff
once spoke about being part of a study
team that looked at the potential
consequences of disclosure. The Duke the
group concluded that it was better to
keep the information secret. One detail,
Larry Maguire tells me that has gone
largely unnoticed in mainstream news is
that the UAP Disclosure Act defined
nonhuman intelligence. The fact that
Senator Chuck Schumer sponsored
legislation that did so is remarkable in
itself. Even more interesting is that
the act called for a review board that
would include a sociologist and an
economist among its nine members. That
raises the question of why these
particular fields were considered
necessary and unless unless the social
and economic consequences of disclosure
were expected to be significant. So
those are the comments from Larry
Maguire, a former Canadian MP who was
principal very in integral in getting
the uh Sky Canada project up and
running. I think it's really important
to get his comments on the public
record. And thank you, Larry, for giving
us those comments. I hope you find that
interesting. And thank you once again
