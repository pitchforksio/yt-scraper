Good day and welcome back to reality
check. Now, as you will know, one of the
big issues with UAPs is the
synchronicity, the connection between
UAPs and nuclear facilities, nuclear
weapons. It's long been recorded that
there are often anomalous objects seen
in or around nuclear facilities. Well,
around about 65 miles, what's that?
About 100 kilometers from Las Vegas,
Nevada, there's a location in the Mojave
Desert called Area 2. That's also known
as the Nevada National Security Site.
And the story we're bringing you today
about what's been happening there is
quite extraordinary. It's based in an
area called Yuka Flat. It's very close,
very, very close, just 18 miles from the
super secret and very mysterious test
facility known as Area 51. Now, back in
the days when the United States began
openair nuclear weapons testing from the
early 50s through to 1963,
it used to be a thing to watch for the
flash of the nuclear blasts from the top
of the highest buildings in Las Vegas.
It's amazing to think these days that
the Vegas Chamber of Commerce promoted
atomic tourism by distributing calendars
and test bomb schedules with maps of the
prime viewing spots. Area 2 was the
location for
144 nuclear bomb tests comprising
163 detonations. It's also a special
nuclear materials storage area where
bomb components are protected by highly
trained nuclear security teams,
including today's witness. Now, there's
been no fullscale nuclear weapons
testing, explosive testing at the Nevada
test site since 1992, since the US
implemented a voluntary moratorum. But
there are still subcritical nuclear
experiments happening as part of the
so-called nuclear weapons stockpile
stewardship program to ensure the safety
and reliability of the US nuclear
weapons stockpile and that doesn't
breach the comprehensive nuclear testban
treaty. There was in fact an experiment
that was scheduled for April this year
in a laboratory that sounds like
something out of science fiction. It's
1,000 ft underground at this site and
it's where they do their critical bomb
testing. So this is by necessity a
highly secure area. And it's my pleasure
today to welcome a gentleman by the name
of Joshua Shelton who was entrusted
during his military service to provide
security at area 2 in the early 2000s.
Now, we've talked before on Reality
Check about the obvious nexus between
UAPs, paranormal phenomenon, and nuclear
weapons and facilities. And what Joshua
is going to reveal today is quite
extraordinary. It's a story that's never
been told before. He was present at Area
2 during an alarming series of
paranormal UAP events there. I've spoken
to him and a range of witnesses, some of
whom aren't yet willing to go on the
record. But like Joshua, Yoshua's
actually testified already to the FBI.
And we're indebted to Americans for Safe
Aerospace, Ryan Graves, for putting us
in touch with Joshua. What has he seen?
What have these witnesses seen? There's
things like UAP craft incursions of the
area 2 facility, orbs, black triangles,
discraft overflights,
animal mutilations,
multiple so-called shadow beings inside
the facility that evaded capture.
Another one they call the white lady who
passed through solid fences. and another
possible different entity they call the
black mass.
Joshua Shelton worked for the 99th
Security Support Squadron at Nellis Air
Force Base from April 2002 to April
2008.
Joshua, welcome to Reality Check. Uh
give me an idea, sir, on um what your
job entailed. What was your role in
nuclear security?
Well, uh, thanks for having me, uh,
Ross. Um, to talk about what I used to
do, I began certified as a security
forces patrolman. So, that's your basic
just, uh, out in the field guarding the,
um, the bunkers and stuff. Then I got my
certification for entry control duties
to run the entry control. And then
eventually, uh, I was a central security
controller, which basically oversees
security operations for the entire
installation. Um, I did that for about
two years. I was involved in two NSIS,
which is where the DoD sends the
inspector general out to inspect the
facility. Um, it's a very high stress
position. It's one of the few positions
where it's a failure for the entire
facility if you mess up. Um,
>> now one of the requirements for anyone
that works with nuclear materials is you
have to go through this rigorous
assessment which requires you to do
what's called the PRP. Can you explain
that to me please?
>> So the personal reliability program the
goal is to get people to work with
sensitive materials who are um most
trustworthy, the best qualified. Um
basically you have to have a pretty
clean record and you have to report
anything that happens like you can't get
hypnotized. So we we were outside Las
Vegas. You can't go to a show and be
hypnotized. Um, I remember I had kidney
stone actually once and uh I feel sorry
for the civilian ambulance but they had
to take me to the military hospital and
then when they got there they got
grilled by uh I think it was um OSI they
were because they had given me
painkillers and so they were making sure
like well what did he talk about? Did he
say anything about where he works at and
stuff and I remember seeing them getting
grilled as I was getting wheeled into
the emergency rooms. feel kind of bad
for them
>> because you know I mean essentially as
part of that PRP you're required
um to essentially be mentally assessed.
You have to be a reliable, stable,
psychologically normal human being.
>> Yeah, it's a it's a big responsibility.
You're talking about the most
destructive weapons man has ever
created. So, it's they they definitely
do a thorough job of screening and then
keep tabs on you, make sure that you
maintain that PRB status, and if you get
sick, you'll lose that PRB status for as
long as you're sick and then you get it
back again.
>> To your knowledge, were nuclear weapons
stored at the facility where you were
patrolling?
>> Yes. Yes, absolutely. We uh numerous
times we had to stand down on live nukes
as they were being maintenance, served,
or just moved in and out of the
facility.
What's it like being up close to
something like a thermonuclear bomb? I
mean, I can't imagine anything more
frightening, frankly, the idea of being
next to something that can literally
bring an end to civilization.
>> It's it's all inspiring at first and
then eventually becomes just part of the
job. Um, I'm reminded of that scene in U
Doctor Strange Love where he rides the
bomb down after he gets dropped from the
bomber. Uh, I can't say if I replicated
that or not, but yeah, it's a it's an
interesting experience, that's for sure.
>> But basically, your role, you you were
essentially in the military, but your
role was to provide security and if
necessary, use lethal force to protect
those nuclear weapons from any
incursions.
>> Correct. And we were very clear about
that. the um the entire perimeter was
reigned with signing saying lethal force
is authorized past this point and um
should anyone actually break in, we were
more concerned with neutralizing a
potential threat than sort of
interrogating like what is the threat or
not. Like we don't play around when it
comes to nuclear weapons.
>> Now, crucially, there's no way that
somebody could inadvertently stray. You
wouldn't get a hiker or um a tourist
inadvertently stumbling across this
site. There's absolutely no doubt that
there is fencing around. Give me an idea
of the level of security around this
facility.
>> So, we had um a triple layer fence line
system and um back in the day the middle
fence used to be electrified, but I
guess they didn't do that by the time
that I started working there. Um, I
would say it is possible for people to
stumble into it up to a certain degree
because we were kind of hidden from
sight by a pair of bluffs and then a
mountain on one side. So, we did get
individuals very occasion. I remember a
group of teenagers I scared the
daylights out of one time when I was on
an exterior patrol.
But you once you get sight of where
you're headed, it's extremely obvious
what's out there. And most of the locals
who would go off-roading or whatever,
they would know and they would know
better than to come close. Um, we had
exterior patrols specifically to make
sure nobody got too close and then
everybody else was on the inside.
>> So before you were assigned to this
facility, had you heard stories during
your training, was there anything said
to you when you arrived that there was
anomalous activity?
So, when I first got to Nellis, uh,
waiting to find out where I was going to
be assigned, um, people that go to work
main base and then people go to work
area 2, they kind of hang out together
for a bit. And, uh, once I found out I
was going to Area 2, there was
definitely people talking, more the main
base people were talking about, stories
they had heard about area 2. Um, not
many of those stories made it to main
base, but there was enough that people
knew like, oh, you're going somewhere
strange.
>> And what did they mean by that?
>> Everyone had a different story, but
there was a sort of uh there was a there
was an awareness that
the place was just prone for strange
things happening. Um, people would talk
about like uh you mentioned the the
white lady was uh allegedly a ghost that
people uh would see up there, but there
would be other things like lights in the
sky, uh lights near the facility. It was
just it had a reputation of just being a
strange place, which talking to people
that worked with nukes after I got out,
it it seems like that that's true for
every facility that has nuclear weapons
or nuclear materials.
>> Yeah, it's interesting. My friend Bob
Hastings, Robert Hastings, who wrote
this excellent book, UFOs and Nukes. I
mean, he's done an assessment interviews
with pretty much anyone who worked at
every nuclear site in America. And
indeed, he's talked to people overseas
as well. And he says it's a very very
common feature. You'd be hardressed to
find any nuclear facility, particularly
nuclear weapons facilities, where there
haven't been, how does one say this
politely, anomalous incidents. So, so
take me to October
2002.
You're assigned to this facility where
there are nuclear weapons stored in
bunkers. Your job is to use lethal force
if necessary to protect. What did you
witness? There was a particular incident
that took place pretty soon after you
arrived in October 2002.
>> So, um, ironically enough, it was
actually my very first night. Um, when
you first get on flight, you're not
certified to be out on patrol yet.
They're still finishing up a little bit
of your PRP status. So, usually you sit
at the security control center and then
you study for your upcoming
certification. Um, so me and two other
uh guys were waiting for kind of
studying, waiting for our PRB status,
and sometime later in the night because
I worked night shift, um, one of the
security supervisors came in and said,
"Hey, I'm going to give you guys a tour
of the facility." So cool. We went
outside, loaded up in his Humvey. He
took us out, showed us around, and then
uh, there was an alarm call for the
perimeter. Um the perimeter split up
into MSC's called marker sensor zones
and there was a uh alarm call to an MSC
where we could drive to and get a nice
line of sight to. So the security
supervisor was like, "Oh, this is
perfect. You guys will get to see how we
respond to alarms and how you do a walk
through and all this." So um we drove up
to the top of this um this hill where we
could oversee a significant amount of
the uh of the fence line. And as soon as
we got out of the truck, it was obvious
that or the Humvey, it was obvious that
something was strange was going on on
the fence. I remember um looking over to
the fence line and at the specific MSZ
that the alarm had been called on, there
was a bright white light that was
hovering uh right over the third fence
line. So, the innermost fence line and
it appeared from our point of view to be
just right over the top um right on the
top of the fence. There's a a sensor
that runs along the top and it appeared
to be right on top of that. Um I can't
really describe any physicalities to it
because the light was so bright.
>> That's I've wrestled with that. Um, I
mean, you couldn't see through it, but
what was very anomalous about it was
that it wasn't really illuminating the
desert around it the way that you would
expect a light to be doing. It was
almost like it was self-contained.
Um,
>> so it was self-illuminating from within.
>> Yeah. And yet somehow it was able to
control the light it was giving out so
that it didn't illuminate the desert
around it the way you would expect such
a bright light to do. How big was it,
Joshua?
>> So, I I was pretty far away when I when
I saw it that night, but I mean, I
walked that fence line for six years, so
I grew very intimate with a fence line.
Um, knowing the fence line, as intimate
as I do, and the dimensions of it, I
would say it was about the size of like
an oversized beach ball, like the type
you might take to the beach.
>> So, so a relatively small sphere, maybe
what, a foot or so across,
>> I would say. larger. Maybe about 3 ft
across.
>> Oh, wow. Okay. Right.
>> About 3 ft.
>> And it was what you saw was a white
color or was it a different color?
>> It was, if I remember right, it was a
whitish color. Um, that's the color
that's kind of stuck in my head is this
whitish color. And uh what was peculiar
about what it did was as soon as Whiskey
8 seemed to the responding patrol as
they're driving up along the perimeter,
it was almost like it was monitoring our
radios because as soon as Whiskey 8
called it in, it started matching the
vehicle speed to maintain uh an exact
distance between itself and the vehicle.
>> So you're quite confident it's
intelligently controlled. It's not a
balloon that's bumped up against the
fence. This This is an object that's
being intelligently controlled.
>> Absolutely. It had intent. Uh it was not
flying with the wind and it it
specifically chose to follow the fence
line almost if it was riding it on rails
until it got to a certain point and then
it made a choice to go in a different
direction.
>> Is there any noise?
From where I would have been, if there
was a noise, unless it was really loud,
I wouldn't have heard it. Um, I did talk
to one of the patrol members afterwards,
but we didn't really know each other
back then. Um, I didn't get anything
from him about a noise or anything.
>> What did he say he saw?
>> He said the same thing that when they
when they were driving up, they suddenly
realized that there was this ball of
light sitting up on the fence line. And
um at first they were going to stop and
get off on foot and do a normal sweep,
but as they were approaching the ball
started moving, so they just followed it
on the vehicle. It ended up being um
Sorry, go ahead. No, I was just going to
say by any measure that in and of itself
is gravely serious in a place where
nuclear weapons are stored, isn't it? I
mean, how what was the response like
inside the facility when it became clear
that there'd been this unauthorized
incursion?
>> So, the initial response was very
serious. It wasn't just the responding
patrol. Uh the alert fire team was
mobilized and ended up chasing along
with the patrol. Then, uh we had a
support patrol armed with a machine gun
who also responded. There to be three
vehicles for a total of eight people
that were physically chasing this
object. Um, they chased it down the
fence line for about a mile and a half
till it got to a place that we call
Culvert 10. And this is where I know
that it it can't have been anything
natural or anything like that because
the entire time it was like it was
riding the fence line as if on a rail.
But here the fence turned and curved to
the right and the object instead took a
hard turn to the left and went out into
the desert. Um,
>> did you get your impression, was this a
surprise to the people there? Had people
seen this kind of object before among
the teams that had been working there
before you arrived?
>> So I talked to over time I talked to
some of the people involved because you
know it was my first night so I didn't
know them then. Some people had seen
stuff. This was the most blatant thing a
lot of people had seen. Some of the
old-timers had seen other more blatant
things, but this this this wasn't
exactly unexpected or too abnormal for
the night shift. It seemed like the
night shift was the one that would see
things like this more often.
>> Were reports filed? Were you were you
asked to make a statement? Was there any
kind of interview that was done with you
about what you'd seen? What what kind of
response happened after the fact?
So, for this incident, I was not asked
to write a statement or anything. Um, as
far as I can remember, I because I was
so new and I wasn't really part of
flight yet, I'm just not fully aware of
what really happened as far as uh
leadership. Um, I do know that
historically
there's a disturbing lack of um
response to things that happen that you
would think would merit a larger
response. Uh, I'm sure some of the stuff
we'll talk about later. I was frankly my
mind was blown that we didn't have I
don't know somebody from DoD there
trying to figure out what happened and
why it happened.
>> Yeah, it makes you wonder. I mean, when
we hear some of your other stories about
what went on there, it does make you
wonder if they knew more about these
objects than they're letting on. Let's
move on. There was another incident
where a large discshaped craft crashed
after silently overflying the storage
depot complex. Tell me that story.
So, this one um this one's a little
disturbing for me because somehow I
completely forgot about this incident
and I don't know how I could have
forgotten because it was so ob it was
right over my head and when we talked
you put me or you got in contact with
Robert Hastings who I had originally
talked to uh shortly after I had
separated. Um so I can't explain how I
could have forgotten about this but as
soon as you showed me what I had told
Mr. Hastings. I I remember the incident.
Um
I was on the uh the alert fire team
which was uh stationed at the alternate
uh security control center and we were
outside. A few of the guys smoked so we
were outside with them kind of joking
and just hanging out. One of the other
patrols was there. It was a total of six
people outside.
And I remember that the guy that I'm
facing, we're talking, joking about
something, and he kind of looks up above
my head and his eyes just go wide. And
as soon as that happens, I kind of turn
my head to look over my shoulder. And as
I'm turning my head, I see this reddish
glow that kind of approaches on the
ground. And uh I crank my head up just
in time to spot this
it. I mean, I hate to say, but it was a
classic flying discshaped object. Um,
I don't think that it was physically on
fire. It was almost like this almost
like magma type glow was wrapped around
the front of it and that was that was
what was illuminating the ground
underneath it. But it was flying maybe
two to 300 feet above our heads, very
low. And as it approached and came over
us, it actually deadened sound wherever
it moved. Uh like the the natural sounds
of like the building right next to us,
uh the desert, other patrols in the
distance, they got very faint. Uh almost
like when you stick your head underwater
and as soon as
>> Is there any noise from the object at
all? Do you hear anything like a
propeller or a jet or a turbine?
>> Nothing. Nothing like that. um a little
bit of a hum, but I I I don't like I I I
don't know if it was the the object
creating the hum or maybe it's
interaction with the atmosphere.
Now, let's not beat around the bush
here. This is a craft, a solid physical
craft of sometime, some kind breaching
the airspace over what is probably one
of the most sensitive facilities in the
United States. if not the world. This is
where thermonuclear weapons are stored.
Describe what happens.
>> So, the object came right overhead and
you could tell it was losing altitude
because it was dipping down lower as it
came uh and passed over us. As soon as
it was clear of us, that's when sound
returned and you could hear everything
normal.
We immediately got on the radios. By the
time we got the first radio call out,
the object had cleared the perimeter
fence line and it seemed to go behind uh
this area that we called the bluffs,
which is what kind of blocked us from
view from the rest of the desert. And
once they went down behind the bluffs,
there was a massive flash of like
orang-ish reddish light. And it was so
big that all of us kind of braced
ourselves because we we honestly thought
whatever this thing is that's just
crashed and like it's such a huge
explosion. We're going to get knocked
off our feet.
>> How big was the object?
>> I'm a little hesitant because at night
time and you don't have a good
reference. I estimated it was 2 to 300
feet above our heads. If that estimate
is right, and I'm fairly confident that
I'm right about that, I would say it's
about 45 to 50 feet across. So, it was
it was a good size object. It wasn't it
wasn't a drone. It wasn't
>> um It was very large. I've been next to
military.
>> Could it have been an aircraft of some
type? Maybe a blimp or a
you know, is there any kind of known
prototype or craft that you can think of
that might plausibly explain the shape
that you saw?
So it was definitely not a conventional
aircraft. It had no wings. It was a
perfect discshaped object.
>> Any windows, lights?
>> We only saw the underside and the
underside was perfectly smooth. Uh there
was no I mean it did go by pretty fast,
but there was no obvious markings, no
obvious signs of
>> Did it have a metallic sheen to it, or
was it of unknown construction? Did you
see did it look constructive?
>> It definitely looked like it was
something that was built and you the
whatever this reddish glow at the front
of it was it it consumed about a quarter
of the craft or the object and it was
reflecting off the bottom. So that's why
I know that even though it was dark,
that's why I know that it definitely had
a sheen to it of some sort. Like it was
able to reflect that light from this
glow.
>> And so you you hear this massive
explosion. Was there a concussion? Was
there a physical force from the blast?
>> So that's the thing. We didn't hear an
explosion. We saw as soon as it went
under the bl behind the bluffs and again
it was definitely on a downward
trajectory. We saw the bright flash of
that orang-ish light. There was no sound
and we expected we braced ourselves.
There was no sound. There was no
concussive force. There was nothing that
you would expect. But we all I mean we
kind of felt stupid because we suddenly
like you do this dumb pose where you
tuck down um nothing no sound no force.
Absolutely.
>> So what's what's the response to
something like that? Clearly something
has breached the airspace over an
incredibly sensitive facility. You've
obviously got to go and investigate.
>> Yeah. So, um I know on the central
security controller side, one of the
first things that he would have done
would have been to contact main base, to
contact um the uh air traffic control
tower. Um so I know that they would have
done that. I don't know the results of
that from that night. But as far as uh
us out on patrol, we immediately went
mobile. Uh anytime there's like a major
a significant security incident, but no
specific threat, everyone goes mobile.
Everyone's uh in their vehicles fully
kitted up, ready for something to
happen. Uh the exterior patrols, Oscar
1, Oscar 2, they were dispatched out to
go to the bluffs because we expected an
object to be crashed there. Um we fully
expected to find like hurt people, uh
something. So they immediately went out
there to start looking for this object
and they found nothing. There was
nothing out there. Now granted, we were
limited in how far we were allowed to go
from the perimeter to like maybe three
to 400 meters. Um,
but I I I I just find it incredible to
think that there was no wreckage, there
was no nothing, no signs of this
accident.
>> Now, one of the uh things that you guys
carry are night vision goggles and
thermals. Did anybody use thermals on
the site where this object had allegedly
impacted with the ground or had been in
the area to see whether there was any
residual heat?
I don't know if the exterior patrols had
the thermals at the time. I'm not 100%
sure, but they definitely carried night
vision and they would have used the
night vision for sure. Um,
>> could it have been a meteor? I mean,
could what you have seen have been a
straightforward meteor? I mean, you say
it flew overhead. It was reddish orange.
Is a meteor a possible explanation?
>> I've thought about that. And the thing
is this object was moving fast but not
that fast. It it was it would have been
moving about the speed of like a
blackhawk. I've been overflown by
blackhawks. I've flown in helicopters.
It was moving about the speed of a
blackhawk. And meteors they move at
terminal velocity. They they can't
control their speed. And for what it's
worth, my friend and colleague Robert
Hastings has checked to see if there
were any reports of bolide meteors or in
that area uh indeed in in any state
adjacent at that time and there weren't.
There were no such objects. So in the
fall of 2004,
another incident took place. You were
patrolling outside a storage depot. Your
patrol was called Oscar 1 and you were
patrolling the desert and there were
bluffs to the north of the storage area
that you used for overwatch because they
were high and you could look down from
them and keep an eye on the site. What
did you see one night?
I'm not uh I'm not a fan of this this
story. Um, so those bluffs actually is
where that object went behind when it
went apparently when it went down, when
it crashed. Um, I remember that that
night, um, we had an interior patrol
call over the radio and say that they
thought there was a truck
on the eastern perimeter kind of up on
the mountain side. They they thought
that that's that they were seeing a
truck up there. So we responded. We went
up to on top of the bluff so we get a
good line of sight to the desert and to
the mountain side. And I pulled out my
night vision and I saw these two lights.
They they were right next to each other
moving together. And through the night
vision you could see them. You could see
them dip and illuminate the ground and
come back up exactly the way truck
headlights would do. So we were pretty
confident. Okay, this is a truck. Now,
we would very occasionally have civil
off-roaders that would go off-roading.
They would get lost. Um,
some people knew we were out there and
they would try to be look and see if
they could like get us peak of
something. Um,
>> so it wasn't
>> it wasn't crazy that there was a truck
up there.
>> Um,
>> and so this area is outside of the
actual facility, but it overlooks the
facility. Is that right?
Yeah, it's it's well outside of the
actual fenced off facility.
Um, so we we keep an eye on it and there
is an invisible line where okay, if the
vehicle gets to this line, that's where
we're going to need to move to intercept
and turn them around. Um,
as these lights get to that sort of
invisible line, they suddenly go off.
They blink off. And uh that immediately
kind of put me on edge because that told
me, okay, these aren't lost off-roaders.
Um this is somebody with intent. This is
somebody that knows we're out here and
that knows roughly how close they can
get before we're going to respond.
So, um unfortunately, the lights were
far enough away that with the night
vision, I couldn't see a physical truck.
It was only because of the night vision
and the bobbing of the lights that I was
confident it was a truck. So, I could
never confirm there was a truck there.
Um, once the lights went off, we
figured, okay, they're going to go on
foot and they're going to try to
approach the perimeter. So, me and my
partner redeployed to about 300 meters
away from the fence line in the
direction that they would have to come
through.
um a main base K-9 patrol was up here
with us because he was uh exercising his
dog and he heard about the radio call.
So he offered to kind of bring the dog
and help us out which was perfect. So
myself, my partner, the handler, and
then his canine, we all went out about
300 meters from the perimeter. We got
down into this dried up riverbed and we
waited. Um the desert is flat here.
There's no cover. There's no
concealment. and then it curves up to
the mountain side. So there it's
physically impossible for anyone to get
past us and get to the perimeter.
So we wait I want to say maybe 5 to 10
minutes before we get a radio call from
one of the patrols on the inside. Now,
uh, Security One, our security
supervisor, what he had done was he took
all the patrols whose AOS were up
against that edge of the fence line, and
he had them go up on top of their
structures at the end of their streets,
so they could kind of give us a bit of
overwatch and kind of help us out and
and look out and see if they see
anything before we do. Um, those patrols
knew where we were roughly because I had
shown my Pack 4 laser towards them, and
you can see it on the night vision. So,
they didn't have eyes on us, but they
knew roughly where we were situated. Um,
so we get a radio call from one of the
patrols that's providing overwatch from
the interior, and they say, "Hey, Oscar
1B advice, you've got a light at your
12:00." And they described this kind of
bright light. They couldn't really tell
if it was up in the air or on the ground
because they just didn't have a good
point of view for that. Um, so if it was
up in the air, it would have been very
low. definitely wouldn't have been high
up in the air. Um, we looked I mean 12
o'clock right in front of you. We look
and we can't see anything. Like I said,
flat desert, no cover, no concealment.
We've got night vision, a lighter 800
meters away, you're going to see a
lighter with that night vision.
Um, we see nothing. We look to the dog
whose job is to indicate. The dog's not
indicating. So, the dog's not getting
anything either. Um, so we sit and we
wait and we listen. You use your ears
more than your eyes when you're in the
desert at night. And a few minutes after
that, another patrol comes on the radio
and says, "Hey, Oscar one, be advised.
Now you've got a light." It was either
our three or 9:00. So either our left or
our right. And uh, this was alarming
because
it feels like we're getting hemmed in
now basically. And we look, can't see
anything, can't hear anything. The dog's
not indicating.
Same situation. No cover, no
concealment. Impossible for anyone to be
hiding, let alone a bright light.
I actually called my uh security one, my
security supervisor, and I asked them to
switch to a clear talk channel because I
kind of wanted to know what they were
actually seeing. And when we swapped
channels, I I straight up asked him was
like, "Hey, are you guys messing with
us? Like, are you guys screwing with
us?" and he tells me, "No, I've got eyes
on it. I can see you got to light your
12. You got to light your three. Like,
this is real." So, um, within maybe a
minute or two of swapping back to the
normal radio channel, a third patrol
calls over the radio and they sound
pretty alarmed and they say, "Hey, you
have a light at your it's either nine or
three, depending on which one the first
one was." And that meant we basically we
were almost completely hemmed in by
these lights. Uh which felt very
threatening to us. Um
>> and they're not at this stage. They're
not inside the facility, but they're
getting dangerously close to the fence
line.
>> No, they were whatever these lights
were, they were interested in us. They
were not interested in the facility
because we were about a good 300 meters
away from the fence line and the from
the outermost fence line. We were out in
the desert.
So finally,
what do you see, Joshua?
>> Nothing. We see nothing. We hear
nothing. The dog is not indicating.
And within 30 to 40 seconds of that last
light being called in, one of the
original patrols calls over the radio
and they're very alarmed and they shout.
They're shout. I can remember them
shouting. The lights are rushing you.
So
when I talked to people afterwards from
their point of view, they all agreed
with this. These three lights showed up,
one in front, one to the right, one to
the left of us. And then as if on Q, all
three lights rushed exactly to our
position where we were at.
From our point of view, we didn't hear
anything. We didn't see anything. The
dog never once indicated it was it
showed no signs of stress or anything.
What I have difficulty explaining is
what happened right at that moment
because the radio was going constantly.
We were getting constant radio chatter
and uh at this point I was very
experienced. I've been out there for a
few years. Uh I had been onseen
commanders for exercises and onse and
real world events. I understood that you
live and die by your radio when you're
in a tactical situation. Um, I can't
explain why I didn't noticed that our we
weren't getting transmissions over the
radio anymore.
Um, let me explain our point of view
first and why this is so anomalous. So,
from our point of view, we get that call
that these lights are rushing our
position.
I look to my alpha and I tell him, "Put
a round in the chamber because whatever
this is, this is hostile." I tell him,
"Put a round in the chamber. Put a
grenade and a grenade launcher. This is
serious." Uh K9 follows suit. I'm
watching 12. My alpha is watching uh
three. And then K9's watching the nine.
We sit for I want to say a good 10
minutes in silence waiting for something
to happen, for any for us to hear
anything. And absolutely nothing
happens. And after 10 minutes,
that's when I finally get the idea that
I should contact the patrols on the
inside and see what they see. And maybe
to civilians, it won't make as much
sense, but I know to any veteran uh this
may this is immediately uh anomalous
because you, like I said, in a tactical
situation, you live and die by that
radio. And if you can't see the threat,
you're in constant communication with
the people that can't. Do you think
something Do you think something was
manipulating your mind?
>> I I don't know. I can't I can't speak to
that.
>> Is that your Is that your Is that your
suspicion that that the way that you
didn't think about using your radio or
noticed that the radio wasn't working?
That is anomalous, isn't it?
>> It is. And
as much as I don't have any evidence for
it other than what I experienced, I have
to say that yes, something very much
influenced the the three of us to not
think about to it. It it was almost like
I mean we didn't even realize that we
weren't getting radio transmissions
anymore even though right before that
there were constant radio transmissions
so we didn't even realize our radios
weren't working. We weren't hearing the
radios and my I carried my radio right
here next to my ear. It's impossible I
wouldn't have heard it. Um, I just I
can't explain why I sat there for 10
minutes as a seasoned onseen commander
already to numerous incidents and did
not think once to call the other patrols
on the inside.
Um, there's another incident and this
time it involved apparent entities,
beings, humanoid shaped beings. Tell me
about that.
um to to kind of put a um
I guess a finisher on on the previous
incident, I did want to say that uh we
did find out that we basically had lost
about 20 minutes 20 to 30 minutes of
time.
>> We um
>> And did it feel like that long length of
time?
>> No. No. And and that was basically after
we were there for 10 minutes, uh I tried
the radio. I tried a radio check when I
realized, wait, no, nothing's
transmitting. We couldn't get through on
the radios, so I made the call. Let's go
back to the perimeter and make visual
contact with the patrols on the inside,
thinking our radios were fried or
something. When we got it was almost
like we crossed uh a line, an invisible
line, and as soon as you crossed this
line, all three of our radio started
transmitting again. We started hearing
people on the inside transmitting. And
were they freaking out that you weren't
responding?
>> Yes, they everyone was looking for us
and and that's that's also what I can't
explain because it was we were in a kind
of from their point of view, our
original position was kind of hidden to
where they couldn't really see us. They
knew where we were at, but once we left
that position, it was flat desert.
There's there's just no feasible way
that patrols using night vision with
high ground wouldn't have seen us
walking. And nobody spotted us until we
got close to where we had stopped our
vehicles at. That's when patrols spotted
us, which was about the same time that
the radio started working.
>> Um I was told by my
>> So so basically they couldn't even get
visuals on you at a time when you really
should have been able to be seen. It it
should have been clear as day that we
were walking back to the perimeter. They
should have seen this long before,
especially with night vision.
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.
>> Wow. So, this presumably was reported
through your command hierarchy.
>> So, I was told to immediately improcess
to speak to uh security one, our uh
flight chief. And uh I wrote a statement
about what happened and he he actually
as soon as I walked in he was like where
the where are you guys? He was pretty
livid. Um and I I was confused because I
thought only like 10 minutes had passed
and then he showed me not only did he
show me on the clock but he showed me on
the the security blotter that like it
had been if it was it was either 20 or
30 minutes more than the 10 minutes that
I thought had passed.
Um, I don't know what happened after
that. And this is one of those things
that is kind of like, okay, shouldn't
this merit some sort of response from
higher up? But as far as I'm aware, I I
don't know. I I Nothing.
>> So, they took a statement from you and
nothing changed. Nothing happened.
>> No. And it wasn't like anyone came to
get a statement from me. I just wrote a
statement for uh our flight chief and
then he would have submitted it to
leadership and that's it.
>> Wow.
Okay.
Now, let's go to get where things start
getting very interesting. Let's talk
about the shadow beings.
So
there there was the main incident that I
know you want to discuss, but there was
a history of of people spotting these
shadowy figures. Um,
we spotted one early on to when I was
first out there. Um, I actually shown a
spotlight on it because we thought it
was our flight chief watching us carry
out an exercise and uh I shown a
spotlight on it to identify him and when
I did it just disappeared as soon as the
light hit him and I've I mean there was
16 of us that saw that happen.
>> How do you know it was there?
So that specific time um we were
carrying out an assault and recapture
exercise at the maintenance plants where
they would do maintenance on the weapons
and our flight chief usually would go
out into the desert and kind of get on a
bit of high ground so he could oversee
everything and see how we were handling
the situation. He called exercise
terminate. And then once he did, we
basically fell into formation in front
of the maintenance plants. And right in
front of us is a row of uh four
buildings that were used way back in the
day. Um when I was there, they were only
used for storage. And one of the
buildings on the far right used to be an
old chow hall. And there was a ladder
that you could take to climb up on top
of it. So, as we're sitting there
waiting, we spot this figure pacing back
and forth on the top of the old chow
hall. And we
>> are these are they're uh half
like a 44gallon drum. They're like half
of a 44gallon drum, aren't they? They're
um uh what do you what do you describe
those buildings? I forgotten what you
call them, but essentially it's a curved
building, isn't it?
>> The maintenance plants. Yeah, I forget
what that what that design is called.
Yeah, the maintenance plants and then
the bunkers are these were just sort of
normal small buildings.
>> So they were flat.
>> Yeah, they were flat roofed.
>> Okay. And what do you see? Where is this
figure standing?
>> So this figure would have been from
where I was standing a good 40 meters
away which is relatively close and it's
pacing back and forth on the top of the
roof at the front.
>> And how do you see it? Because you told
me earlier that you had to shine a light
on it.
>> So this is in darkness. How do you know
it was there? What did you actually see?
>> So, it was solid black figure and you
could see it very clearly because the
the entire perimeter is lit up and when
the clouds are low, it throws that light
up and you can see it silhouetted up
against that light. Um, it it was not
hazy. It was not It was very clearly
seen.
>> Humanoid.
>> Humanoid. Um, I mean, we assumed it was
our flight chief. We we were we were so
confident it was our flight chief that
we started calling to him
>> clothed
>> can't tell any details like that it I
mean it was pure black and we couldn't
tell any details like that
>> height
>> I would have estimate if that was a real
person and because I had carried out so
many operations right there in that area
I know it very well I would have
estimated to be about six six feet
>> right so standard
>> I'm very confident in that tall male
human height.
>> Did it Did it look like it had the build
of a male or a female?
>> Impossible to tell. But I mean, we were
we
assumed it was our flight chief. Like
there was no cuz it it kind of looked
like him a bit like he was a bit
lankier.
Um there was nothing like we didn't we
didn't see it and and thought it was
anything strange. So, you shone a light
on it and it disappeared. How many
people saw that shadowy object?
>> It was 16 of us. 16 of us cuz we were
all sitting there and we were calling to
the figure. I think it was our flight
chief. And then when it wasn't
responding, I took a spotlight from uh
one of the other members. And then I
turned it on and as I cranked it up to
the building, as soon as the light hit
the legs, that's when it just
disappeared.
>> And when you say it disappeared, it
literally physically disappeared.
>> Mhm. It was there one moment, gone the
next.
>> Did you go and have a look at the top of
the building to see if there was any
heat source or any marks on the top of
the building?
>> So, we we went and looked. Um, nothing.
I mean, yeah. Not not there's a bit of
gravel on the on top of that roof. Um,
and there was no indication that like
somebody had been up there recently or
anything.
>> Could Could it have been, I don't know,
some kind of illusion? Could it have
been a bird that for some reason looked
like the shape of a human?
>> So,
no, it couldn't have been something
natural that was projecting the shape of
a human because it was too clear. It was
we were all extremely convinced
initially that this was a our flight
chief, a physical person. Um it couldn't
have been a trick of the light, nothing
like that. It was way too solid a figure
and there was nothing reflective around
her or anything.
>> So that was the first of the shadow
beings incidents that you experienced.
>> Did you make a report of that incident?
No, because it was it was too common.
It
specific because it was so low stakes,
you know, we didn't feel there was a
security threat or anything.
>> I mean, let me devil's advocate for a
moment. I mean, it sounds crazy. I mean,
there's an illogicality here. There's an
irrationality here. There is clearly an
unauthorized
humanoid
in the facility inside an a facility
with thermonuclear weapons who's not
part of your security patrol. They
should not be there. That by definition
is a security breach, isn't it?
>> Absolutely. I it I guess the reason why
the second incident was a major thing
was because there was more evidence that
this was a living entity. Well, let's go
to that.
>> Let's go to that then.
>> So, the second incident, um, this
>> when was this?
>> This, if I remember right, would have
been about 2006.
If I remember right, it was about 2006.
Um,
so we every night we would carry out an
exercise. It would vary what the
exercise was, but this night we were
practicing recapture and assault
operations. And we had a dedicated
training structure for it. where it was
an empty bunker, no weapons or anything
in it, but it was it was just like the
real thing. And um I was on scene
commander for that in for that exercise.
And uh when you dealing with nuclear
weapons in normal CQB, you want to
secure the perimeter of a building and
you want to you want to make sure that
your backs are covered and all this.
When you're dealing with nuclear
weapons, you have to get custody of the
weapon immediately. So you don't take
the same safety or security measures you
would take. So, we get to the structure,
we set up the assault force. We haven't
swept the desert behind us or to the
sides of us because again, you have to
get to the weapon. Um, but we have an
oversight patrol um who's up on high
ground and they're several hundred
meters away and they are overlooking
everything. They can see everything and
they can see behind us and if there's a
threat, they can engage it with a
machine gun. Um, as we uh as our assault
force is getting ready to go in, the
overwatch patrol, Whiskey 11, calls over
the radio and they say, "Hey, be
advised. You've got two individuals in
the desert behind you. They're they're
proned out in the desert behind you."
>> And is this inside the facility or in
the desert outside the fence?
>> This is inside the facility. And it's in
the desert in between streets. So, in
between streets where the bunkers are
at, there's a
>> So, this is a this is a this is a
serious breach of security. This is
Yeah, this is as serious as it gets, but
we assumed it was part of the exercise.
Initially, we assumed it was part of the
exercise. So, I told the assault force,
"Go in." And then I told the machine
gunner on the Humvee that's parked in
front of the doors, keep an eye out
behind us, be aware. Assuming again,
it's an exercise. Within seconds though,
our uh security one, our flight chief
comes to the radio and he asks for
Whiskey Lebanon to say again, to make
their report again. and Whiskey Lebanon.
Also assuming these are two individuals
that got put out there uh you know
because we would grab other patrols to
be bad guys. Um so that we would have
someone to exercise against. So he tells
him, "Oh, I've got eyes on two
individuals. They're prone down in the
desert. Um I forget the distance. It was
within like 50 to 75 meters behind us,
though." And then uh security one
immediately calls control and he calls
for an exercise terminate. And as soon
as he says that, I know, oh, this is
this is real world, like something's
happening.
>> So, you start putting live rounds into
your guns at this stage.
>> So, we uh we exercised with live rounds,
which I know sounds crazy to some
people, but uh yeah, we we trained how
you fight. Um so, I yanked the assault
force out of there, and my first job is
I'm going to set up a a sweeping
element. Um security one calls a code
red response. Code Red being a security
incident inside of the facility, not on
the perimeter. And that's that's as
serious as it gets. Like that's an
extremely serious event.
>> So if you if you see these people, are
you entitled to use lethal force to stop
them?
>> We are entitled to use lethal force. We
would attempt first to apprehend them.
Um, but I mean we had enough leeway that
if we even felt that they were hostile,
we could have used lethal force. But you
do want to first attempt to apprehend.
Um, but that being said, we were ready
to use lethal force. Absolutely.
>> Do you see what these people or beings
are?
>> So,
we set up the sweeping element pushed
out into the desert. And the way that I
organized people was one guy would have
naked eyes, the guy next to him would
have night vision. That way you got two
different modes of seeing. And then we
also had the handheld thermals. Um
our uh our overwatch patrol that was
seeing the whole thing. They could see
the individuals in the thermal the
entire time because they were giving us
information on exactly what they were
doing.
>> And according Are they recording this?
Is there any recording of the images?
>> No, the thermals we had didn't have
recording capabilities, unfortunately.
>> Sorry for interrupting. Keep on going,
please.
>> No worries. So, as we are moving up,
Whiskey 11 that's on Overwatch tells us
that they're reacting to us, that
they're basically adjusting to how we're
approaching to constantly keep
concealment between them and ourselves.
That definitely tells me that this is
these are people. We assumed they were
people. They're intelligent. They they
don't want to be caught. They don't want
to be found. Um
so I've talked to one of the guys that
was um overwatching on one of the Humvey
that was at the front of the structure.
So not the machine gun team. He told me
that he was getting intermittent sights
of the individuals on the thermals. So
he was also seeing individual thermals
intermittently, but because his angle
wasn't as good as the Overwatch machine
gun team, he couldn't keep them
constantly inside of the thermals.
But from our point of view, when we got
to within 15 to 10 meters of the two
individuals,
um, Whiskey 11 called over the radio and
said, "Hey, they just disappeared. They
just apparently just blinked out." We
went to the position where they were at
and you could see on the ground that
there was scuff marks from dragging as
if someone had been proned out and
moving, crawling. With our handheld
thermals, you could see residual body
heat on the ground as well that was
quickly dissipating.
>> So, how many seconds after they were
there did you get there? Oh, as soon as
they told us that they disappeared, I
told my guys to rush forward because
once you lose sight, you can't take the
risk that they're going to.
So, I would say three to four seconds.
Did you or any members of your team at
any stage see these shadowy humanoid
shaped beings?
>> The only visuals uh was on the thermals.
um nobody that I know got eyes on um
outside of the thermals.
Now I understand there's an incident
where you looked up at one stage and
there was a figure standing about 100
meters distant. Uh you've told me about
this previously. Is this a separate
incident or is this this incident?
>> No, this is a separate incident. Um
>> so tell me that story. So, this is one
of the incidents where you actually
personally saw these so-called shadow
beings.
>> Absolutely. Um, this was uh I was on an
exterior patrol. So, we were not in the
inside of the perimeter. We were outside
of it. And there was a um there was an
area where Red Horse, which is like the
Air Force construction people, they
train at with their heavy equipment. And
uh it was tucked away kind of in a
valley in between two mountains. And we
were in there, me and my partner were in
there as exterior patrol and we were
just kind of, you know, joking around
just we got 12 hours to kill.
And as we're sitting there talking with
each other, out of the corner of our
eye, both of us at the same time spot
this figure that is running in between
two of the buildings that the Red Horse
people used to store equipment. And then
I think one was like their bathrooms or
something. And uh it was silhouetted by
the moonlight because it was a full moon
that was kind of behind and so it was
silhouetted by the moonlight. It was
very easy to see. You couldn't tell any
details because it was kind of far away,
but it appeared to be very tall.
Definitely got the impression that it
was very tall, especially because we
knew the buildings and when it
approached the building, knowing where
the roof was at, you could tell that
this was a very tall individual.
>> How tall?
>> I would estimate over easily over six
feet. uh maybe seven feet. And and
again, that's knowing the height of this
roof very intimately because I had been
there so many times.
>> And is it a humanoid shape?
>> It's a human humanoid shape. Um
>> is it running like a human?
It ran like a human. But what was
apparent about it is uh so we knew the
distance between the buildings and it
was crossing a distance that would have
been about 120 ft in maybe 4 seconds.
>> Pretty fast, powerful being
>> extremely fast. Uh because that is what
really got our attention after we
spotted it. We watched it run and it did
it two or three more times in between
the two buildings. And also the
buildings weren't perfectly lined up
with each other. They were kind of
offset. So it's 120 ft but then also a
bit of a diagonal distance.
Um so whatever this thing was, it was
crossing
that distance extremely quickly. Um far
quicker than than the person should have
been able to.
I'm just figuring out how much the speed
is for 120 ft in um 4 seconds.
Um
it's uh 30 ft pers. Wow. That's
incredibly fast.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. That's that's incredible. I mean,
I don't I don't know who's saying bold
speed, but I bet he'd be hardressed to
match that figure.
>> I'm pretty sure he would. So, do you
pursue the figure?
Um, after we watched this for like a
good minute as it went back and forth,
me and my partner looked at each other
and we both had the same kind of look in
our faces and basically we figured, hey,
this is outside our area of
responsibility. It's not approaching the
perimeter. It's not approaching the
facility. It's not our problem.
>> So, we kind of moved back.
>> No, absolutely not. Um,
>> how much of this do you reckon Joshua
is? I mean, I'm not playing any
disrespect to you, but do you think I
mean, a lot of what you're describing
here, it feels to me like something's
manipulating your mind. You know, don't
worry about this. Just ignore this. I
mean, it's kind of weird when you think
about it that your mind responds the way
it does. I mean, this is clearly a
suspicious figure operating around a
military facility. Um, it it should twig
your suspicions, shouldn't it?
>> Absolutely. Um
there's definitely times where it does
feel it it does feel tricksterish.
Absolutely. Like there was many times
where
these phenomena felt very tricksterish.
But then there was other times where it
was it was so common for something
strange to happen that unless it was a
an actual security threat, you would
just kind of shrug it off. Like it was
just it was too common. Was part of the
issue as well that in order for you to
keep your personnel reliability program,
your PRP for working with nuclear
weapons, was there a reservation or a
stigma about reporting these incidents
because people might think you're crazy?
>> So within flight, we were pretty
comfortable talk talking to each other
again because almost everyone had seen
strange things. But definitely talking
to anyone outside of flight, that's when
you started thinking about like, okay,
well, I don't, you know, I don't want to
screw up my career or like I don't want
to lose my clearance. Like there was
definitely a stigma about discussing
things. You you you'd maybe talk to like
uh when the colonel would come down um
or the wing commander would come down,
you would maybe only talk about like a
major security incident. You wouldn't
tell them that you saw a figure moving
at 30 feet a second running back and
forth between two buildings. You just
wouldn't share that.
>> And yet, let's be honest about it, they
should know, shouldn't they? I mean,
this is one of or close or adjacent to
one of the most sensitive nuclear
weapons storage facilities in the United
States.
>> Absolutely. I Yeah, I I agree 100%. I I
think uh this culture of fear and
ridicule uh is a major disservice to our
security personnel because if I'm an
adversary, I want to mimic the strange
phenomenon in order to get close because
I know that you're probably not going to
report it. You're probably not going to
investigate it. So, it's a it's a major
security blind spot in my opinion.
>> Absolutely. Was there any time when you
did pursue a shadow being that you saw?
>> Yes. Um, and this was earlier to when I
was out there, so it shows that I was
not trained yet to kind of ignore things
that weren't a major threat. Um, so I
was on exterior patrol again and we were
rendevued with the other exterior patrol
on top of the bluffs where things like
this seem to happen.
And as we're sitting there talking, I
look up past the guys and it looks like
a person and I honestly thought it was a
person but kind of backlit.
So as soon as I see the person, I issue
a challenge and then the figure runs and
it runs straight away from us. So I
start running and then the three guys
with me, they start running.
>> Are you hearing any noise of the figure
running?
No, but I think I I would have been too
excited and too like adrenaline pumping
too much to pay attention to something
like that. Um, what is definitely
strange was that you couldn't run at
your full speed out there because of the
rocks and the terrain. You would snap an
ankle if you tried to run at full speed.
But this individual was just balls to
the wall just going. Um, I mean, he left
us in the dust. And then the direction
where the figure went was where the
bluffs drop off. And when it got to that
point, we lost it. Like we kind of lost
it. And so we assumed it must have
hurdled over the edge or like jumped
over the edge. And we stood on top of
that that ledge and looked around with
night vision and we should have been
able to see anybody and there was nobody
there. Couldn't see anything.
How many individual experiences did you
have where you or members of your
security team saw these shadowy humanoid
beings?
>> I've either experienced or heard of
maybe about a dozen over the six years.
>> Really? So, it's quite a common quite a
frequent occurrence.
>> It is. And and that's I think that's
also why we unless it was an obvious
threat or unless we had more evidence
that this was something physical, we
just wouldn't we wouldn't really treat
it as seriously as we maybe should have.
Now the reason why this matters Joshua
is because
what you're describing here and this is
no reflection on you. It's a reflection
on the way the system works.
There's a pattern, a clear pattern of
incursions by something intelligent,
some kind of intelligent being, possibly
human, possibly not human, that is
breaching one of the most secure,
important, dangerous facilities in the
United States. Now,
it's a worry, isn't it, if these
incidents aren't being properly
investigated or reported? Do do you feel
from your experience in your time there
that these incidents were being properly
reported and investigated?
>> No, I don't think so. Um the impunity of
whatever this phenomenon was to evade
detection to get to wherever it wanted
to be. Um
that's alarming in the extreme. Um, as a
security professional, it just I can't
imagine dealing with something that you
you have no control over. You can't stop
it, you can't prevent it, you can't
catch it. Um, no, I definitely feel,
especially with the more high-profile
incident, that there should have been a
bigger response.
What was the general response from your
commanders to the fact that something or
someone was breaching the security of
one of America's most sensitive nuclear
installations?
>> So, I distinctly recall one time when um
our colonel, our unit commander came in
um just in a regular like morale check
basically
and he came by each patrol to kind of
like talk and chat a little bit and
stuff. And I brought up one of the
incidents, you know, and I I was talking
to him about it and I distinctly
remembered the way that he literally
just went h just like that. That was the
full response. Um
I I don't know. I can't explain that. I
don't know why that was the response,
but that was the only thing you said.
Okay. That's not the only kind of
incident that you've witnessed, though.
There's other incidents which are even
more disturbing because they involve
something getting in or near the bunkers
where these nuclear weapons were stored.
Can you talk about that?
So,
I think um
I think kind of one of the more
uh disturbing things that happened um
we had a uh we had a section of the
bunkers that
they we called them blackworld bunkers
and they were bunkers that when they
were open they were the only ones we
weren't allowed to pull security on um I
believe it was DOE that would bring in
their own people to do security on that
and we actually weren't allowed to be
anywhere near when those doors opened,
but we still had to in normal day-to-day
operations. We had we still had to go to
them and check the locks. You would when
you would start your shift, you would go
to every single bunker, you go to the
door, you would check the locks, make
sure that these big giant padlocks are
securely on. Um you would check the
vents, these air vents to make sure
nothing's been put in the vents. Um just
do a general integrity check of the
door. And um one night when it was uh my
my patrol that was in that area, I went
to do my check of these black world
structures and I checked the lock. Lock
was secure. I checked the first air vent
and they're these kind of like these
they had this big heavy handle that you
would lift up and it would open it and
then you would just let it go and it
would clang really loudly. I checked the
first one. I go I check the second one.
I let the thing go and it clangs really
loudly and then uh
something from inside smashed into that
door. And these are
two-tonon jacks I think is what we
carried. So, these were about two or one
ton doors each. And there were two doors
and they're sunk into the ground. And
something smashed into that door in
response to me letting that second air
vent kind of clang closed. And it
smashed loud enough that I jumped like
it scared the daylights out of me.
>> So, you know that there is something
inside a secure weapon storage area that
even you are not allowed to enter.
>> Yes. And when I reported it, it was sort
of a okay, well, what's the integrity of
the doors? And we can't do anything
about it because we we didn't have
access to those structures. And as long
as the integrity of the structure was
intact, it wasn't on us to
>> But come on, something's inside there,
isn't it, Yoshua? How sure are you that
there was something inside that
facility?
>> 100%. 100% sure that something smashed
into those doors from the inside. My
partner was in the vehicle about a good
15 meters away and they heard it cuz
they jumped as well. That's how loud it
was when it smashed into these doors.
>> So whatever was inside that bunker, it's
never investigated what was inside
>> by us. No,
>> this is crazy. I mean, this raises I can
see why you've gone to the FBI. What was
the FBI's response when you started
telling them about this? I mean, the
Defense Department, the Department of
Energy, they're obliged under federal
law to protect the nuclear weapons
stockpile.
To me, the fact that there aren't
protocols in place to make sure that
that facility was immediately opened and
inspected to make sure that whatever was
inside was caught, apprehended, that's
outrageous.
Um, when I spoke to the FBI, they shared
the same concern that I did that there,
I mean, these are glaring security
vulnerabilities.
Um, the only thing I can think of is
that somebody must have known that this
would happen and that there was no need
for a response because they knew exactly
what was there.
>> Have you ever heard of the skin walkers?
the Indian mythology about skin walkers
in and around Utah.
>> I have I did some research um for my
previous job where I talked to some
Native Americans about it about the
phenomenon. Yeah.
>> What do you think? Is it possible that's
what you were seeing?
>> I I wouldn't I I don't have a good frame
of reference. I I would say that having
talked to some Native Americans about
the skinwalker uh myth, there's
definitely some things that line up, but
I I I don't have enough information to
say like, "Oh, definitely or not."
>> One of the other things that really
concerned me was animal mutilations. Did
you ever witness any of these yourself?
>> Yes. Um
one of them and then I saw photos of a
second one, though there were three in
total.
What did you say?
>> So this was towards the end of my
enlistment. Uh so I believe it was
either late 2007 or in 2008 is I believe
when it happened.
And uh one of the exterior patrols was
out along the perimeter driving along
the perimeter and they came across a
carcass of a donkey um that had been put
on the side of the road.
Now, the animal had eyes and tongue
removed. I'm I'm trying to remember the
exact details because there was three
different animals and I believe the
first one had eyes and tongue removed
and then its stomach had been cut open
and the interior was gone, but there was
no gore on the ground. There was no
blood on the ground. There was
>> so completely exanguinated, no blood and
specific organs removed with presumably
extremely sharp and precise cuts
>> there. Yeah, there was no tearing. There
was no nothing. Um the one that I saw
>> this wasn't animal predation.
>> No, not a chance. And I've hunted. Um
I'm fully aware of how you the mess you
leave behind when you get a buck. Like
when you dress when you field dress an
animal, I'm fully aware of the mess that
it leaves behind. Uh, no. There and
there was no
even though the So, the second animal
was the one that I saw when I was on
extra patrol, which is a few days
afterwards. Um,
this one had no signs whatsoever of even
scavengers coming to the the corpse. Um,
this one was the same way. No blood, no
organs. Um, clean. It was dead.
I just want to put on record that
from the work that Bob Hastings has
done, it's quite clear that these animal
mutilations have happened before at
facilities like this. The other thing
that Bob's talked about, he he named
another witness with his permission
called Chris Cbrera who who worked at
the same depot as you from 1998 to 2002.
And there were multiple sightings of
shadowy bipedal figures moving around
inside the bunker complex that appeared
not to be human. And Chris on one
occasion describes entering a storage
unit. Quote, "I had a feeling of needing
to turn and look behind me, and when I
did, I saw a black mass deep in the back
of the storage unit. It was just there,
not moving, but I was able to make out a
humanoid shape to it. what looked like a
head, shoulders, and a torso extending
to the ground. I had to look up at it
slightly, but didn't see any other
details because there was minimal light
coming in from the entrance. The mass
remained still and seemed like it was
just observing me. My thought was to run
towards the entrance, get out, close
that door as quickly as possible, which
I did. Clearly, there's a long history,
Yoshua, of these shadowy beings in and
around this particular nuclear weapons
storage facility.
>> Yeah. And I from the details that you
just read to me, that sounds very
familiar to things I've heard people um
one of my sergeants saw almost the exact
same thing actually in a different
building. And it's interesting because
my friend Christopher Sharp, who
publishes an excellent publication
called the Liberation Times, uh he
published an exclusive where a nuclear
technician detailed serious security
breaches at a US nuclear base at
Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. And
again, it involved alleged shadowy
beings. He said he witnessed a black
mass in the shape of a person standing
about 6t tall. He chased it
unsuccessfully and he was worried about
losing his PRP accreditation if he
reported it. And Bob Hastings also met
another guy who served underground at
Minet Air Force Base in an underground
nuclear missile launch facility. He was
taking his sleep when his missile
commander suddenly began screaming,
thereby abruptly waking. He said he was
nearly hysterical. Took him a few
minutes to calm the guy down. He told
his deputy that while monitoring the
launch console, which displayed the t
the status of the 10 nuclear missiles
they were responsible for, um he looked
out of the corner of his eye, saw some
movement, and saw a tall, dark figure
standing close behind him, basically
human in shape, no discernable features
such as a face. He thought it was a
ghost and began screaming and
immediately the intruder disappeared
before his eyes. And just to finish the
the sequence, George Nap and Kong
Kellaher in their excellent book, Hunt
for the Skinwalker, they also site
shadow beings. And again, this is at the
Skinwalker Ranch and they talk about how
when the NIDS team, the um Institute of
Discovery Science team were up on a
ridge. They had infrared binoculars and
they saw a fuzzy beach ball of light
hovering a few feet off the ground. The
round opening slowly grew into what
looked like a tunnel of light, maybe n 8
to 10 ft long. And the guy with
binoculars looked in horror as some sort
of large entity, humanoid entity,
wriggled its way through the tunnel,
stepped out onto the ranch, and ran up
towards the ridge. The creature was
dark, maybe 7 to 8 feet tall,
featureless, but humanoid in shape.
So Joshua Shelton, what the hell are
they?
You know, I wasn't aware of how
frequently these were being seen. Um, I
had heard from some people, but I have a
hard time thinking that it's coincidence
that the exact same thing is happening
around nuclear facilities, um, sensitive
sites. Um, I mean, I've heard civilians
kind of describe the same thing, but it
it just seems to be so much more uh
centered around uh sensitive
installations. Um, yeah. I I just have a
hard time believing that that's a
coincidence or that we're all crazy.
>> So, the FBI is now apprised of your
concerns about how does one say this
apparent shortcomings in the response by
the Department of Energy and the
Department of Defense to investigating
these incidents? Do Do you think they're
taking this seriously?
>> I know that the team I talked to was
definitely taking it very seriously. Um,
it's hard to tell what's going to
happen, what's going to be the result of
this. Um, it feels very much and and
that was the feeling I kept getting when
I was working there was these are such
high-profile incidents, but yet there's
no major response. It's almost like
somebody knows and expects and knows
that it's not going to be a real threat
to the weapons.
Um,
>> but that's, as you say, that's precisely
what a potential foreign adversary would
exploit.
I note I note, for example, just this
week when the drones flap was happening
over Scandinavia, Vladimir Putin teased
the idea of UFOs, whether real or not. I
mean, a foreign adversary would want you
to think that these were just anomalous
paranormal phenomena, which weird in and
of itself that you'd turn a blind eye to
that, but something has clearly breached
the security
of one of the most dangerous facilities
in the world. Period. Right.
>> With impunity.
Joshua Shelton, thank you so much for
joining Reality Check. I sincerely hope
that the grave national security issues
that you've raised get properly
investigated by the FBI. I think the
Congress sadly has its head in the sand
on these issues at the moment with its
failure to pass the UAP disclosure laws
and I don't think we should be holding
our breaths expecting a response from
the new administration, the White House
anytime soon. But we can but hope. Let's
sincerely hope the FBI takes this matter
seriously. Thank you so much for joining
Reality Check.
>> Thank you, Ross. Do you mind if I say
one final thing?
>> Sure.
>> I agree with what you said about
Congress and I think that it's time we
start looking for a solution ourselves
and stop expecting the government to
provide one. And I think that the very
first step to take in that direction is
to reshape the cultural narrative. I
know plenty of guys who can corroborate
everything that I've said, but they're
too scared to come forward. They're
scared for their careers and they're
just scared of ridicule culture. I
decided several years ago that I wasn't
going to hide anymore. As you know, I
originally contacted Mr. Hastings and I
was basically intimidated into silence,
not through threats, but just sort of
people that I trusted being like, well,
you got to think about your career and
what might people say and stuff. And I
think that um foundations like the Soul
Foundation are doing great work, but I
think that there's a cultural element
that needs to be tackled on top of the
scientific one to where we need to
reshape this narrative about this
ridicule culture that has been
weaponized against witnesses, been
weaponized against whistleblowers.
Um there are little kids seeing things
in their bedrooms that they can't
explain. There are grown adults
experiencing things that terrify them.
And the people they should be able to
turn to to talk about these things, they
can't because they're scared to death.
And our academia is suffering from this
crisis of bias to where it's not that
the data isn't good, it's that they
don't like what the data says, so they
disre they disregard it offhand. So I
I'm I'm very happy about shows like
yours. And I think there needs to be a
more concerted effort to reshape this
cultural narrative regarding the
phenomenon, whatever it is.
>> Wow. Yes. I couldn't have said it better
myself, my friend, but I'm so pleased
you added that at the end of this. I
completely agree with you. And and the
thing I find most well, the word is
sinister is the fact that government
seems to be prepared, the Department of
Defense, the Department of Energy, they
seem to be prepared to turn a blind eye
to even acknowledging that this
phenomenon is real.
>> And they're not letting us know why.
So your bravery, your courage, and being
willing to come forward is what's
absolutely fundamental. So thank you for
being a whistleblower and thank you for
giving your evidence to the FBI.
>> Oh, thank you for having me.
>> And before we go, please don't forget we
