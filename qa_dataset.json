    "question": "All right, Ross, we will go to our first question and actually an interesting theory from Evan. He says, \"Thank you, Ross and Megan, for all your hard work. Watch you guys all the time.\" By the way, Ross, your accent is so freaking awesome. I hope one day I can shake your hand, sir. Would be an honor. My question whenever you have the time to answer it is, what do you think about the possibility that these drones could actually be looking for their stolen tech that we all know someone has? I know they are all around the world, but it's interesting that they are spotted in localized areas like New Jersey. It's not like we see them out over here in Lexington, North Carolina. I mean, if we have recovered tech from crash UFOs, it's a safe bet that these aliens have the ability to track their own tech, just like our own military, where we are not supposed to leave our military high-tech equipment behind for adversaries to possibly use or reverse engineer. I'm surprised no one has thought of this as a possibility. I'm convinced that these drones are alien, and if they were Russian or something else, then I would expect our government would have shot them down by now. Just curious about your thoughts. Sincerely, Evan. Well, that's a really good question. U I I have to say if they are looking for their own tech, then there's a hell of a lot of tech that they've had taken off them that's hanging around the continent of the United States. And just to respond to your uh point about North Carolina, there have been sightings in and around North Carolina, repeated sightings. I've spoken to people who've been seeing these purported drones, but even more interestingly, large black triangle objects. Um, the uh gentleman we interviewed a few weeks ago, Magic Mike Batista, he lives very near Fort Bragg in South Carolina. and uh he told me about an incident that uh was attended by among other people Fred Baker, the u uh special forces soldier now retired, who was with him when they summoned allegedly a gigantic multiple football fieldsiz triangular craft. And that's a uh a sighting in South Carolina that was witnessed by Fred to corroborate what Magic Mike says he was able to see. It's interesting because I actually favor the explanation more likely that what we're talking about here is if it is non-human intelligence, and I suspect some of it is, I suspect they're taking an interest in weapons, defense facilities, nuclear armed, nuclearpowered facilities. and I hope they're friendly. There's a great quote from a uh an Australian journalist who was investigating UAPs in New Zealand, Quinton Fogerty, and he said, \"Let's hope they're friendly because whatever they are, they're demonstrating um what you might call ISR, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Every single nuclear site in the United States has probably been visited by NHI, UAPs.\" Robert Hastings wonderful book, UFOs and Nukes, tells the story really well. Robert set out to investigate sightings that he heard about when he was sweeping the floors at a US Air Force base and he discovered over many decades that there were people who'd seen objects over nuclear weapons facilities, nuclear uh power facilities in pretty much every such facility in the United States. And this is the same all around the world. So, I favor the idea that whatever they are, they're taking an interest in in nuclear weapons because perhaps they're concerned about our use of nuclear weapons. Or worse still, perhaps they're wrecking to find out where our most powerful weapons are. I just don't know the answer. But it's completely within the realms of plausibility in my book that if you're a non-human intelligence coming back to this planet, you're interested to know where your technology is being stored by the United States. And certainly there are a lot of sightings over Tonipar, Area 51, uh China Lake, all of those big national security ranges that none of us are allowed into. And I'd love to have a look inside the dark caves and crevices inside those facilities because I'm told there are some very interesting things locked away. I'd also be taking a very close interest in Sedona, uh, which is the place where we've told the story previously of an alleged deep underground military base.",

    "answer": "forgive me for interrupting, Megan. I should say  I should say Melinda Leslie recently told me she's the Sedona based UAP tour guide uh who takes people out on night vision goggle tour guides and Belinda let me know just this week that the frequency of UAPs being observed over Secret Mountain at Sedona being escorted by military helicopters it's completely off the charts. She's saying she's never seen such an intensity before. So whatever these objects are, it's happening much much more frequently.",

    "question": "All right. Well, this email that I'm just about to read, this is some objects being seen as well. So, dear Megan and Ross, I live in the city named Ron located at Borholm Island. We are part of Denmark, although although we are located south of Sweden. Three days ago, I had two observations timing around 10 p.m. local time. One, I saw my I saw from my yard a white sphere moving fast. The best description I can think of is like a billiard ball in the size and color. Clearly much larger than the planets and much smaller than the moon. Color was white. It seemed to have its own color, but nothing was raying. It moved very fast. I saw it for less than a second. I saw it from 90\u00b0 to 120 degrees at the horizon. Then it disappeared behind house roofs. um height over ground no more than 100 meters moving in parallel with the earth not falling I guess the distance between 500 to a thousand meters two later less than an hour I observed from my first floor window an object of the same size as the stars it was blinking as stars do but it was blinking red white green and the object was steady not moving the direction was toward the airport of Borholm distance from my window 5 kilometers I think it might have been a drone drones were observed over the airport by other people that evening. I follow your channel and never miss anything from you guys. I saw what I saw what I saw, but I have never heard of anything in that size and color. The nearest I can think of is the egg with Jake Barber, but the size was too small for that. So my question, have you any knowledge about an object like this and the coincidence with the drone observations? Has anybody else had such an observation?",
    "answer": "Okay, it's really interesting, isn't it? This is such clever psychological operations. So the government started using the language of drones. They started immediately suggesting that these objects were Russian. And they may well be. But the simple fact is what people are telling me they're seeing, what has actually been videoed and photographed are often not what look like drones. And neither are they small light aircraft as certain seagull obsessed people are are suggesting. What these people are telling me they've seen and I've had hundreds of messages from people with videos and photographs is exactly what this correspondent suggests. Orbs, spherical orblike objects. And th this is very very common. And I've had messages from Norway, Denmark, Sweden, France, uh Germany. People are telling me they're seeing these weird spherical objects often reasonably close, like within 150 ft. There's no discernable noise. There's no propeller. There's no jet. There's no engine noise at all. These objects are moving soundlessly. when they do move, they kind of have a glow from within. Um, and then sometimes some people swear to me, and I' I've I've seen video showing this, but it's very very blurry, and quite frankly, it doesn't really prove much at all. You you you see an orb object, and then you see it kind of change, and you see the shape in some cases of a quadcopter or what looks like an aircraft. And it can't plausibly be an aircraft because it's moving at maybe 10 kilometers an hour, 10 miles an hour, just moving very very slowly, impossibly slowly for a um a jet aircraft. And nobody can explain what this is. And the interesting thing is the language that's been used of to describe the objects that were over the airport is drones. And this correspondent immediately delineates between what they're seeing and the reported drones over the airport. And frankly, I'm not buying that they're different. I still think we need to consider the possibility that they're all one and the same objects, but that they're capable of changing form. At the moment, uh we're talking I think it's uh early October. There is no evidence at this stage even though there's been a police raid on a um a ship called the Borke or Bourke. I've forgotten what it is, but it's a a tanker that was boarded by French naval forces with great publicity and apparently the captain and the first mate were arrested. There's no evidence anywhere on that ship of drone technology. Now admittedly, if it was the dastardly Ruskies, they would have thrown it overboard, I'm sure. But it's just doesn't make any sense to me that for over a week, we've had dozens and dozens and dozens of sightings over civilian and military airspace right across the sway of Western Europe. And not one of those objects has been able to be tracked. Some of them have been enormous. Some people have said that they're the size of a large passenger aircraft. Um, a lot of people have described them as being roughly 5x 5 m square. That's a significant object. It would show up on radar even if it's made of carbon fiber or plastic. Why are we not able to track these objects and follow them to source? And when they're hovering over empty areas, as we know they have been, why are they not able to be brought down with high pulse microwave or other counter UAS technology? I'm not saying it's not the Ruskies. I'm just saying show me the evidence. And isn't it clever the way that the word drones is used to immediately plant in the mind of the public the most plausible Okam's razor explanation that this is just the Russians. And I think there's a risk behind that. The risk is escalation. The risk is that the Russians get upset that they're being accused incorrectly perhaps of deploying these drones. And frankly, we should ask, we should test these claims that are being made. There is no evidence at this stage that it's the Russians. Um I do recall uh a drone flap, I think it was back 2022, 2023 over Sweden and there was an arrest made of a young Russian man and a lot was made in the national media at the time that he was linked to Putin through his father because his father ran the railways in Russia and he was arrested and accused of spying using a drone. And it turned out he was acquitted. Not really widely reported. He was acquitted because it wasn't able to be proven that he knew that what he was doing was illegal. He had a yacht. He put his drone up over his yacht and he was arrested for using his drone. So, a lot of the evidence that's being used to point at the Russians, yes, I know the Russians are quite capable of being duplicitous and dastardly and evil and they will do terrible things if they can get away with it. But in this case, I just want to see evidence. Show me the evidence and why can't we track or bring down these objects? It doesn't make any sense to me.  Okay, Russ, we were going to stick with um questions about the egg. Deadrock um reached out to me on X saying, \"Ross, can you provide any follow up on the egg retrieval footage shown during your Jake Barber interview?\" I responded asking what specifically would you like information on? And he's saying, \"We know nothing.\" So any all info on date, time, location, circumstances leading to the landing, crash, retrieval carried out by who, details of the egg itself, who took it away, where was it taken, etc.  Okay, think about what you're asking. If I gave you the date, if I gave you the location and the full details, then what would happen? The people who provided me that video might be implicated. So, one of the things we have to do as journalists is protect sources. And uh yes, I'm absolutely convinced that the egg video is authentic. It's genuine. And it's very typical of the kind of objects that Jake Barber has been on his own admission involved in retrieving in the location he euphemistically calls the range. I can't tell you any more than that because one of the obligations we have as journalists is to protect our sources. It took a hell of a lot to get that video. It didn't come from Jake Barber. It came from other sources. And I know it's authentic and I'm afraid you're just going to have to accept it. What I find is very, very conspicuous is the complete lack of comment from the Defense Department or the intelligence community or the government. They've said nothing. And the reason why is because they know it's genuine. And they also know that we know a great deal about the range, where it is, and who's involved. And what really I think frustrates me is Congress could do this. Congress knows all this because they've been told about all of this in secure skiff hearings by Jake Barber. They've got this information. So, why the hell are we, how does one say this politely, pussyfooting around by um not calling people who should be called or allowing people who are evading being called to evade being called, we should just subpoena these organizations. And that's why it's a very good development that Anna Paulina Luna, the chairwoman of the oversight committee task force that's investigating um uh this issue. She's basically said that they're going to start subpoenaing witnesses possibly involuntarily and they've sent out interrogatories questions and one of the things they should be asking about is questions about these particular facilities where Jake Barber has given firsthand evidence of his direct knowledge of being involved in retrievals. So I'm sorry I can't give you dates. I can't give you names. I can't tell you who's involved because to do so is to compromise sources. Um, I think it's an extraordinary act of courage by Jake Barber to have come out and said what he said and done what he's done. And frankly, the most conspicuous thing that I can see is the failure by Congress to pick up on those allegations and actually do the job. I mean, we've just had this depressing situation this week where we've learned that for the third year running, the UAP disclosure laws are going to be gagged in the Congress. It's not going to happen. We're not going to get new laws that protect whistleblowers coming through in the defense appropriations legislation. And that's a disgrace because the Republican uh congressional representatives could have voted for this and some of them didn't. And they need to be held their feet their feet need to be held to the fire and asked why. And the reason why is because they're little licks lap dog puppies to the national security state. Who's running America? Congress or the national security state?  I know.",

    "question": "Um I will go to a question from Shardwell also from X Ross. When Dylan Borland says he knows about quote the most important technology in this world and it's not the craft itself. Is he talking about scalar weapons?",
    "answer": "He could be. I don't know. I haven't I haven't spoken to Dylan. I'd love to speak to him. Dylan, if you want to talk to Reality Check, we'd love to have you on. It's uh fantastic to see Dylan giving evidence to the Congress at the recent congressional hearing and it would be wonderful to get him and Jeff Masatelli onto the show to hear their full stories. Um I I'm not sure. I think he might have been referring more likely to the energy systems which lie potentially behind this retrieved technology. If it is true, and I suspect it is, that the United States has been able to develop a knowledge or an understanding of 0 point energy extraction. Um, that's energy from the quantum vacuum, which would be literally an unlimited source of energy. Um, maybe what he's referring to is the fact that the United States is sitting on a solution to the fossil fuel greenhouse gas crisis and um he thinks it's as outrageous as the rest of us do. If it's true that this energy technology is being suppressed, then that would explain a great deal, but it could very well be scalar weapons.",

    "question": "Okay, we have a question from Shaker Head. Um, we have talked about Matthew Brown's immaculate constellation before and I did send this viewer a link to that and we've briefly done it on the Q&A, but he wants to know why hasn't Matthew Brown's immaculate constellation report on UAPs been discussed on reality check? His insights were highlighted by Rep. Nancy Mason deemed credible by others. Is there a specific reason for this omission?",
    "answer": "Oh, interesting question. Um, look, to be honest with you, um, I I've felt that Matthew's been on so many shows. We try and bring you programs that break news. And, um, my friends and colleagues, George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell over at Weaponized, who've done a superb job bringing Matthew's story uh, to public attention. Um, uh, I'd love to have Matthew on with Reality Check at some stage. And I've really enjoyed and I recommend to people that they read his more expansive Substack essays that he's been writing in recent times. Um, you can go to Matthew Brown's Twitter and you can find your way to his Substack through there. Um, uh, I I would like to see a more detailed government response on Matthew Brown's comments about Immaculate Constellation. Um, basically, uh, you know, he's made these assertions and the most conspicuous thing is the complete absence of comment from government as to the veracity of his claims. Let's hear from government. Um, I'm very careful on reality check to make sure that we're not recycling stories, just telling the same old stories. We try and break news on reality check. And I really admire and respect Matthew and any other witness who's had the courage to come forward. I'd love to get him on reality check. The simple fact is there's one of me and there's only so many weeks in the year and uh Megan and I are doing our darnest to get on top of the number of people who are already responding to us and sending us information for potential interviews. Um maybe we should. I'm very happy to consider it.",

    "question": "Okay, we have a question coming in from Anthony. Hello Megan and Ross. Hope you're well. Ross, I have a question for you that's a bit out there, but in your years of researching UAP, have you ever come across any link with wolfman, werewolf, werewolf type entities traveling in red orbshaped craft, perhaps like those investigated by BASS? I asked because in this channeling session from 1976 when referencing a case in the book silent invasion by Stan Gordon, it is claimed that the craft encountered quote was a thought form created by entities of the astral plane. It had substance in being in our world for a short time. It conveyed the bodies of creatures which are likened to what you call the werewolf. These creatures emerged upon the physical world. End quote. I have heard accounts, witness accounts of werewolf like creatures from the skinwalker ranch. Of course, uh but I don't think I've heard instances of werewolf wolflike creatures flying in orbs. I think there's two separate things. There are accounts that I do know of from the BASS investigations which were the Defense Intelligence Agency sponsored investigations at the Skin Walker Ranch in the Uinta Basin in Utah. And one of my favorite stories is uh the Sherman family shooting with a 3030 rifle, which is quite a heavy caliber rifle, at a gigantic wolf, massive wolf that was allegedly six or seven feet long in its body, just sitting staring at them. And um Terry Sherman apparently went inside. He initially fired a pistol at it. Then he went inside and grabbed his 3030 rifle and fired several rounds at it. and he and his wife Gwen basically said that it made no discernable effect on the creature and it just loped away. No blood trail, nothing. It didn't seem to be injured. Um, and there's been in the skinwalker ranch a succession of such sightings and weird experiences. The whole skinwalker story involves creatures that appear to turn into wolves. Um, it's central to the George Neap and Com Keller book, Hunt for the Skinw Walker, uh, which I really recommend. It's a great read. And it, that book talks about a former DIA official, James Lett's interest in the ranch. And, um, Latky got involved, uh, through the ORAP funding, um, with Bass investigators looking at similar crypted encounters. And in those encounters, the Shermans who were the previous owners of the ranch before uh Robert Bigalow and then more recently Brandon Fugal, they reported these wolfmanlike figures and they've been seen by the Ut Indians for many many hundreds of years. And it looks like a werewolf on steroids allegedly. And and it's part of the skinwalker legend. this massive howling OB beast stalking livestock. Um I I I wish I could see some of this. Um uh it's been widely reported in the Skinwalker Ranch. Um there have also been orbs, red orbs reported by the Shermans and I think also cited by the um Nids and Bass team. Often they're just one or three feet in diameter. They maneuver silently. They they show heat and apparently they've even caused burns and electromagnetic interference. There's one account that involves an orb, a red orb hovering over cattle. And there were mutilations that that happened subsequently. It's not sure whether they were connected, but they were these surgically precise animal mutilations, precise excisions without blood. Um there's also um another orb, I'm not sure if this one was red, that was chased by dogs and they disappeared into the bush barking after this orb and they were never seen again. And the interesting thing is these are government scientists in some cases that are actually reporting these sightings. Um there's been huge craft reported over the Uint basin, not all of them read. Um, uh, I'm just trying to remember what it was. Um, in the I think it was the bass analysis, they suggested that there was something interconnected. They James Latki's team viewed the cryptids as perhaps some kind of interdimensional manifestation uh, tied to these probes. Um, their report, which has been partially released via FOI, includes ranch data on biological effects from orbs involving non-human entities. And I vaguely recall there was a BAS employee who used the pseudonym chip. And he confirmed in interviews that there were links between werewolves and orbs that were probed as evidence of interdimensional incursions. So yeah, I mean Skinwalker Ranch is a hot bed for this, but I can tell you I've also in my investigations here in Australia, uh I've spoken to people uh in the little town of Xmouth, far up on the northwest coast of Australia near the very mysterious what was once a US base called the Harold Eye Halt Naval Communications Station. And uh as well as one woman telling me that she saw a werewolf stealing her mangoes off her mango tree, multiple people have told me, including um council workers, people who were working on the road in the area, that they've seen loping hairy wolflike creatures in the area. And there have been red orbs reported over that area as well. And I don't think it's a coincidence that these are two hotspots of paranormal activity. Maybe there is some kind of portal at both of these locations. There's a lot of speculation of portals. Portals in places like Sedona, places like Northwest Cape in Australia and Utah, the Uent Basin. So yeah, there are definitely red orbs. There are definitely allegations of werewolves, wolflike creatures. I haven't heard any specific mention of wolflike creatures on craft, but I wouldn't be surprised. All right, Russ, we have one more question for today's Q&A. We need your insight on the horrible breaking news out of Australia of Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban breaking up.",
    "answer": "Look, it's very sad. We we were devastated to hear this. Keith and uh Nicole actually own a house about a kilometer from where I'm sitting and it's in the Southern Highlands uh just south of Sydney, a beautiful big rambling country house. A lot of us in the area who know that they live there and visit occasionally, we respect their privacy and they've put these gigantic earth berms around the property so that um snappers photographers can't sneak illicit shots of them. And frankly, I feel so sorry for them. I think the pressures of public life are such that the intrusions on their privacy and their time are such that it must weigh on them and the kids. Um, uh, my wife and, uh, daughter recently went to Keith Urban's concert in Sydney, and they're now realizing they'd missed out on Breaking the Big Scoop. Because at the very end of the concert, which was about a month ago, he said, um, uh, thank you very much for tonight's show. After the week I've just had, I needed this. And we now realize, of course, what he was alluding to was that he was in the middle of a breakup with Nicole. Um, uh, I feel very sad about it to be honest. A lot of people in Australia are very proud of the relationships that Australia has with the US and we like seeing our native kin thrive. Nicole, of course, was born in Hawaii, apparently, so she's an American Australian, but we still claim her as our own. And look, Keith's a lovely man. He's a beautiful human being. My favorite story about Keith Urban is we did a story once on the TV show I work for in Australia about these little kids in a very remote country school, Aboriginal kids who loved music and they wrote Keith a letter. And blow me down, he turned up in a with a cargo hold full of guitars and he bought every child in that class a guitar and he sat with them on his own back and played with them for a morning, sang to them. Most beautiful thing that he could possibly do. And there are similar stories about Nicole. I feel for both of them. Uh they're two wonderful human beings who suffer the ignammonies of living in the public gaze and I can only imagine being apart from each other for so long places huge stresses. I felt the same way when I was working for 60 minutes Australia. I was on the road for six or seven months of the year and it placed huge huge stress on my relationship. So, my heart goes out to them and um if you ever do get back together, your neighbor says hi.  A beautiful tribute to their relationship. Ross, thank you.",

    "question": "[Music] Good day and welcome to that most terrifying time of the week for me where you get the chance to turn the blowtorrch on your host. I'm Ross Kulart. Welcome to Reality Check Q&A. And to help me with this excoriating examination, here's Megan Orda. Good day, Megan. How are you, Ross? I am great. Good morning to you down in Australia. We want to start um we want to get your thoughts on an interview that was just released with former presidential adviser Harold Malmgrren. He sadly just passed away as you know, but in this interview with Jesse Michaels, he says, quote, I directly handled UFO material. Can we just get your reaction to what Harold revealed? I'm so glad you've asked me about this because I think this is one of the most important interviews of recent years. Harold Monggrren was a great American. Picture this. You're a 27-year-old super clever guy. You get hired into the White House to work for JFK. The Cuban missile crisis breaks out and you've got General Curtis Lame, the head of the US Air Force, wanting to launch nuclear missiles in a preemptive attack on the Soviets. What do you do? You get Harold Malgren to avert nuclear war. That's what that that's what Robert McNamara, the defense secretary did. It's an amazing story. Harold worked in the JFK White House and he went on to work closely. In fact, his his CV is absolutely extraordinary. Um he went on to work for LBJ, Nixon, and Ford as a presidential adviser. He also had a personal relationship with Vladimir Putin in Russia and he's advised every Japanese prime minister since Tanaker in the 70s. Gisgard Diston in France, Pompyu. Um the credentials of this guy are extraordinary. And before I get into what he actually said in the interview, I just want to express my absolute grave concern at the fact that someone in the last 24 hours since Jesse Michael's interview has gone up has started trying to delete to nominate for deletion the Wikipedia page of not only Harold Malongren, a great American, but also his daughter Pipper, who's also an incredibly dedicated former public servant, a very senior economist who served in the Bush White House. For some reason, someone has taken it upon themselves to delete the two Wikipedia entries of the Mongrren family. And here's why. In the interview that he did with Jesse Michaels, Harold Mongren asserts that he actually held material that had been recovered from the Bluegill triple prime thermonuclear bomb blast in the Pacific in 1962 in his hands. It came out of the plume of a nuclear bomb blast. And a good friend of mine, Jeff Crookshank, who's a friend of the Reality Check show. He's been on the show a couple of times. He did the work that showed there was in fact a film available online from the Department of Energy showing that object, whatever it is, falling out of the thermonuclear cloud at the time. And what's quite incredible, I've been privy to this for a while, well before um sadly Harold passed in February. What happened was I was talking to Pippa Mongrren who came out to Australia and she told me what her dad was saying and how he was opening up about what he learned about UFOs in the JFK White House. How he was briefed by I think a deputy director of operations for the CIA called Richard Bissell into the fact of the CIA's legacy UAP retrieval program. Yes, that it was true. So you had a very very authoritative American public figure, somebody who's had the credentials of an ambassador stating categorically not only that he held UFO material, but he was read into the program in part by Richard Bissell from the CIA, the director, I think he was the deputy director of plans for the CIA, the man who designed and built Area 51, Richard Bissell. And he also told um I mean this is really important stuff because you'll remember in the U David Grush interview David Grush talked about the 1933 Magenta UAP crash where the Italian fascists recovered a craft that was at one stage being looked at by the the Nazis and then eventually secretly covertly recovered by the CIA by the Americans and taken to America in around about 1944. Harold Mongren confirms that story. He was told that story. This is important stuff for the people who say there are no witnesses who can give evidence. This is why his evidence matters. And it's obviously why someone in the last 24 hours has taken upon themselves to try and delete any references to what Harold Mongrren has revealed. In the worstc case scenario, it's just those jocks who call themselves the gorilla skeptics on Wikipedia who are complete deniialists and who go around excluding any information that suggests there's any credibility to the UAP story. In the worst case scenario, it's an arm of the defense or intelligence community trying to exclude to censor what Harold Mongren said from public knowledge. So all of you out there, please go to Jesse Michael's American Alchemy page on YouTube and watch this incredible 3hour I think it's 3 hours 18 minutes interview. I'm still working through it. It's such a huge thing. I haven't been able to get through it all yet. But every time I go back and watch it, there's another aha moment where I go, \"Oh my god, it really is quite extraordinary stuff.\" One thing to finish, by the way, with with Harold, he told Pipper, who's a good friend of mine, in the last few hours of his life, he told her that he was aware that there had been UFO crash survivors, biologics, recovered from Roswell. And moreover, he had seen a video of the sole surviving extraterrestrial being from that crash. that this is why somebody is trying to delete this information. And what is going on at the moment when one of the supposedly most authoritative sources of information on the web, Wikipedia, is allowing itself to be produced by people who call themselves guerilla skeptics who basically go in and delete things that are inconvenient to their narrative, to their cause of events. This matters. It's really important. I think Congress needs to get into the issue of who is censoring Wikipedia. Thank you, Megan. Rent over. Thank you, Russ. And we will link to that interview that Jesse Michaels did for our viewers if they want to see it to give him some credit for our friend. Um, okay. Our next question comes from loyal viewer Nancy Coffin. Ross, this is in um about the all female space flight that just went up a few days ago. She wants to know, \"With all the buzz about the Blue Origin space flight, what is your opinion? Was it fake or real?\" Oh, come on. Of course it was real. You can't fake a a space flight. I I don't buy the whole fake space flights, fake Apollo moon landings. People wake up. These things happened. You know, the sooner we stop denying science, the the sooner we actually get on and start dealing with the reality of UAPs. We can't let pseudocientific claims creep into the uh the narrative on UAPs. We have to stick with science. The Bezos um origin space flight happened. They did go into orbit. It happened. So, by the way, did the moon landings. And uh let's let's put that to one side and get on with dealing with reality. Reality check, if you will, for us. Thank you. Couldn't help myself. Okay, here comes our next question from Josh. Hi, Ross. There seems to be a narrative shaping around the phenomenon and its connection to the old gods of ancient Egypt and Greece. With all the amazing work you've done in this area and after your recent trip to Giza, I'm curious. Do you think there's anything to this connection? Well, look, it would be too speculative for me to say that there's a definite connection, but there's certainly, I think, something in the fact that the true story of ancient Egypt, as is related by official history, doesn't make any sense. I'm actually persuaded and I've spoken to so many people about this now that the pyramids, the Sphinx, and a lot of the ruins that are cited as being part of the pharaohic civilization are in fact a hell of a lot older, possibly tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years old. I do think that there is evidence of prior highly advanced intelligent civilizations on this planet that have never been adequately explained. I'm actually going to Peru, Bolivia, and Easter Island later on this year to have a look at the ruins there. And the megalithic ruins of Egypt, the megalithic ruins of South America, you can't explain them easily without considering the possibility of a prior civilization. And is the evidence of that prior civilization being suppressed for the simple fact that a lot of archaeologists just find it an inconvenient truth. They'd rather not talk about it. How do people explain the the water damage on the Sphinx and the fact that the last time there was water around the Sphinx, I think, was between 10 and 12,000 years ago. It doesn't fit into the official narrative. Now, if UAPs were involved, well, the suggestion would be that perhaps it was some non-human intelligence that was in charge of this civilization. Uh, I have no idea. It would be too speculative for me to go there. But I do think that we shouldn't embrace and just willy-nilly accept the idea of a prior civilization, but we should at least consider the possibility because the facts don't fit with modern archaeologies assertion about these ruins. And far too much of what is known or asserted about about pharaohic pharaohic I can't even say it. I've still got co about the ancient Egypt. Far too much of it is is essentially not adequately explained by modern archaeology. Okay, Ross, thank you. This next question is coming from William Murray6921. Why are these things always landing in America? We don't hear of aliens in Russia, India, China, etc. They never seem to be consistent sightings anywhere else. Why? Okay. Well, there's an assumption there that frankly is wrong. Those sightings do happen all the time all around the world. I commend to you, if you're asking about Russia, I commend to you an author by the name of Paul Stonehill. He's written superb books about Russia. Um, I think there's one called Russia, the UFO Files, and he goes into great detail about how the Soviets in the era of the USSR did a 10-year study into the UAP UFO mystery and they concluded that whatever they were, they were real. And Russian scientists have engaged with my friend and colleague George Knapp early in the days of Glasnost because we before we all fell out. and George came back from Russia with an extensive compendium of files from the Soviet investigations into UAPs. There are numerous sightings of UAPs that have occurred that are part of history that are recorded. You only have to read the books and look. One of the problems we have with this whole subject matter is there are priority assumptions that are made by people. Oh, this only ever happens in America. You know, these things only ever happen in America. It's only crazy Americans that see UFOs. Not true. I mean, we know that there have been UFO sightings like Rendlessham in the United Kingdom. The UK's been pelted with UFO sightings. But I here in Australia, it's a huge issue in Australia. That frankly, the reason why it doesn't get as much coverage as the US is because we have governments that continue to deny any knowledge of the UAP issue. they continue to suppress it. Whereas creditably in America, at least the government, the Pentagon has formally admitted that UAPs are an authentic mystery. That's the big difference. And so there's, I think, a willingness, a much greater willingness in America for people to talk about it. But I think that's changing. I think all around the world there are sightings. If you could only see my inbox, I get literally tens of thousands of emails a month from all over the world from people telling me that they've seen craft or luminous objects in the sky. And it's not just the USA. It's an international phenomenon and it does seem to be drawn to sensitive military facilities, particularly nuclear weapons or nuclear power facilities. Okay, great. Thank you, Russ. Let's go to a question now from Carmen. She wants to know, \"It seems the main push for disclosure of NHI is focused on the US government. Why isn't there more emphasis on other nations to disclose? Don't they have programs too? France, UK, Canada, and of course, your own home country? Why is so much pressure on the US? If any country disclosed, then that would be enough, right? Because the US is a beacon of democracy in the free world.\" Well, that's the official narrative. and and frankly I think largely it's been true for much of the last 60 or 70 years. A lot of the leadership in the free world has come from the United States. So it doesn't surprise me that the if you like the breakthrough the censorship of the cover up that's occurred on the UAP issue starts in America. But there have been I commend to you again if you go to the UK go into the public records or the national archives office of the United Kingdom and type in the Condine report ci um Dr. David Clark was able to obtain on freedom of information that shows just how seriously the British government investigated UFOs. Then go across to France and you have GAPA Gean, which is a French quasi government agency that investigates UAPs. Just recently, I've forgotten his name, but there was a French official who spoke out publicly in an interview only in the last couple of weeks, and he's indicated very strongly that the French government may be inclined to be much more transparent about what it does know on UAPs. And I do think that there is a high likelihood that France or possibly China might be more willing to be more open about UAPs than the United States. The US sadly is still locked into a kind of a national security censorship complex which is stopping it from telling the public the truth. And my biggest worry, frankly, is from talking to so many people in the defense and intelligence community in the US, they're going to get scooped. they're going to be left looking ridiculous because I do think other governments in the world are looking on at the US waiting for it to show the lead. This is an opportunity for President Trump to actually show great initiative and to show himself as a liberallyincclined president in terms of freedom of information to reveal to the public what he does know and what his his colleagues know in defense and intelligence. There is no good reason why the public can't know. That's generally conceded and acknowledged by the majority of people that I speak to in the United States. And frankly, I think there's a good chance that if the US doesn't s do it soon, they're going to get scooped. Okay, let's go to our next question. This is from my um favorite handle of the day at Big Daddy Magic. Ross, thank you for the important work you do and for how you do it. question. Can you explain to us lay people the persistently rumored link, if any, between NHI interacting with this world and demons? Why do religiously aligned people seem to consistently warn against interacting with NHI, warning it is demonic? Is there an indication that the NHI is the root of religion itself on Earth? I've had conversations with people in the intelligence community and the US Air Force particularly. There's a lot of and I'm not condemning this. I'm just saying it seems to be a fact. There is a high level of evangelical Christian belief at senior levels in the US Air Force. And I've had a conversation with somebody at a senior level in the US Air Force who has flatly asserted to me that we need to be extremely wary of engaging with this phenomenon, the UAP issue, because they say it is demonic. And in his interview with me that he did for NewsNation, Lou Alzando when he was launching his book imminent, he talked about how there is a huge problem with resistance to transparency about the UAP issue because some men in suits think that you, the public, don't have the right to know about this because it's demonic. My personal view is e even if something like demons do exist, what are they? What essentially it's describing is something that perhaps we don't understand. It might be evil. It might be malevolent. Why shouldn't we know about it if it exists? So I don't understand the argument. It's a nonsequittor. It doesn't flow. A doesn't follow B or B doesn't follow A. It doesn't make sense to suppress something just because somebody takes the view that it's demonic, that it doesn't fit with their religious beliefs. That's my view. All right, Ross. Our next question is coming in from David Ross. Please give us your thoughts on what you think about the Ashen Forbes assessment on the missing MH370 claims. His investigations seem to have credibility. Thanks for your great work. Okay, however I answer this, I know I'm going to cop excoriating barbs from Ashton Forbes, but here goes. So I think 10 weeks after MH370 disappeared in uh March 2014, I was actually one of the reporters covering the whole story at the time. So I've got a pretty good grasp of this whole story. But ma I think MH370 went missing on 8th of March 2014. 10 weeks later, there's a guy called Reicside Anon who posts online a really intriguing video and it does look initially very convincing and it shows an aircraft that looks like the shape of MH370 moving through clouds. Um, all of a sudden it's surrounded by swirling orbs and then it seems to disappear in a big flash. And Ashton Forbes is a um uh UAP researcher who has embraced this video with relish and has made the assertion that he thinks that there's been a cover up of sensitive vision that was leaked from a military satellite showing this abduction by aliens of MH370. Now, I try and keep an open mind on most things, and I've never really commented on this before because frankly, Ashton is a very aggressive person who doesn't take kindly to people criticizing his theory. But I really do think it is time to give a response to this issue. Firstly, I've spoken to somebody in the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency who tells me that the video that is shown in that supposedly leaked video bears no resemblance at all to the kind of video telemetry that you get from those satellites. It's not NGIA, NGIA or indeed any other type of US government satellite. But more importantly, and I I think surely to God, this would kill the issue stone dead if people looked at it. There are videos of the clouds that were taken from a photo bank, a known photo bank, and they show very very clearly that whatever the um I'll just put it up on screen. So I think the one on the left is the one that's cited in the um MH 370 video and promoted by Ashton Thorbs. And the one on the right is from a photo video bank and the guy who actually shot the photograph for the photo video bank which is essentially a raw archive of images. The photographer has come forward and said I shot that photograph. That's my cloud. And all I know is that when Ashton was asked about this and asked to explain uh the uh reasons why the clouds in the supposed leaked video bear an identical resemblance, not a resemblance, they're identical to the ones from the photo archive. He really didn't have an adequate explanation. In fact, when Denny Jones raised it with him on his podcast, he gave Danny Jones a rather purile explanation that um my butthole looks like your butthole, which is quite vulgar and really didn't answer the question. So, I'm really sorry. I don't agree at all that this is persuasive evidence. And I think that Mick West to his great credit the um skeptic I think he calls himself Metabunk he wrote a piece for the the skeptics which basically went through in great detail Mixer also a guy who's worked I think in CGI and graphics and he's explained I think very persuasively why he doubts very very much that the MH370 video is an authentic leaked government video. But I know as I say this that I will immediately become the victim of excoriating attacks from Ashton Forbes who is unbelievably aggressive. And I have had maybe a hundred people demanding that I embrace Ashton Forbes theory hypothesis and give it the credibility that all of them think it deserves. I'm sorry. I don't think it has credibility and I think that the video is almost certainly a hoax and it has never been properly explained why the uh images that are used in the video are not just resembling resembling but actually identical to images taken from an archival photo archive. Okay. I wasn't expecting to hear you say um butthole today, so thank you for that laugh. Uh one more Ross. Uh this is from Ken Wood. Question for your next Q&A. What is known about the alien species evolved in the Brazilian varha UFO incident? They don't seem to fall into any of the existing categories, grays, Nordics, reptilians, etc. Well, funny you should ask. I actually have on my desk a three-dimensional rendering of the Fajinha uh alien which um Tom and Shaborn Lon from Nima what is it called again? Nima Creations I think it is in the United Kingdom sent me. And this is a three-dimensional rendering of what two young girls described they saw huddled against a wall in Vinha Brazil. And it's also conforming to the shape of whatever the entity was that was witnessed by multiple people uh from the Brazilian military and indeed at a hospital in Vajinha in Brazil. It does look demonic, dare I suggest coming back to what we were talking about just a few minutes ago. Um and yes, you're right. Uh there are all manner of alien entity shapes that have been described by witnesses and this is one of them. But if you look at it, it doesn't bear too close a disresmblance to the gray aliens. No discernable nose, or if there is a nose, it's very flat. Huge apparently black eyes, no ears, and a tiny slit for a mouth. Um, I would keep an eye out for my friend James Fox's forthcoming investigations into the Vajinhar uh entity and I think also a good friend of mine Ronnie Verete from Brazil has also been taken a taking a very very close interest in that subject. I don't think we can exclude the possibility that the Brazilian military and indeed members of the medical staff at the local hospital where this creature was allegedly taken, I don't think we can discount their claims that they saw some kind of biological alien entity likely. Uh I think we're going to be seeing some very persuasive witness evidence very soon. All right, Ross, that's all I've got for you today. Oh, that's all over. Okay. Okay. Well, I've probably aroused enough controversy this week by talking about buttholes and claiming MH370, but uh let's uh let's get more of your questions. If you'd like to ask me a question, I try and answer as many of them as possible, but we do get thousands. It's reality check atnewsnationow.com. And we love answering your questions.

    "question": "[Music] Good day and welcome back to reality check Q&A where you get the chance to put the blowtorrch on your host Ross Kulart. Good day and also hello to Megan who's going to ask me the questions. Hey Ross, good day to you. We are actually going to start with something from you this week. You posted on Twitter, whistleblower goes public on Immaculate Constellation, alleges covert US program monitoring UFOs. You were one of the first to talk about Immaculate Constellation. What did we learn here? Okay, this is a a very very important story. This is a a guy called Matthew Bran who uh I think at the at the moment he's working for the state department but he was working for the defense department when he became aware of a lot of confidential UAP related files that were on the Jwix server, the confidential servers used for communication inside the defense and intelligence community. and what he discovered formed the basis, he confirms, of the immaculate constellation document that was tabled in Congress last year. It's a very very important fact that Matthew has now gone on the record and admitted his credentials to my friends and colleagues George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell because there were a lot of people suggesting that Immaculate Constellation the document was essentially a hoax a forgery and that it didn't amount to much more than a hill of beans. Now, we know from Matthew on the record that Immaculate Constellation is in fact a special access program code name that was brought in after Lou Alzando went public in 2017 with the fact of the Pentagon's um ATIP UAP UFO investigation program. And boy, some of the stuff that Matthew says is really important. He he's essentially describing the worst nightmare I think for a country like the United States that prides itself on democratic accountability. There are so many very interesting quotations from Matthew and there's a couple here that really worry me. One is it's a parallel reality. The secrecy apparatus is all persuasive. It's not just in the intelligence community governing their world. It's not just the military protecting their operations. It's not protecting diplomats and leaders as they conduct their work sometimes in very dangerous places. It, and he's referring here to the legacy retrieval and reverse engineering program, it has been allowed to corrupt and infest every aspect of our society to serve the interests and whims of a very elite select few. Amusingly for those of us at NewsNation who broke the Dave Grush story, Dave Grush's name apparently was absolutely verboten. He was a non-person inside the defense department. You weren't allowed to raise, he says, Dave Grush's name in any of the chat groups relating to this issue. He um he he raises a lot of concerns here about the unnecessary secrecy attached to the program. He says, \"The secrecy that has been defended is at the cost of, in my mind, human dignity, freedom, and progress. It is no longer permissible or acceptable in my mind to continue this course, to deprive another generation, not just of Americans, but humanity of their birthight to know who they are, where they came from, and what's with us.\" We have as a country, he says, allowed ourselves to be penetrated, co-opted, and corrupted by an internationalist force that serves their interests and views nations, peoples, as tools, and means to an end. This is really serious stuff. He's basically suggesting that there's a a state outside the United States, a cabal of people, an internationalist cabal, I presume business related, which is essentially protecting the secrecy of the program and doesn't give a hoot for democratic accountability. And I know I'm giving a long run to this, but I think it's really important that we um we go into some of the detail of what he describes. One of the things that he describes among a lot of the videos that he says he saw on the system, very clear videos of obviously some kind of anomalous object. He can't confirm, of course, that they're nonhuman, but whoever is operating these craft has highly advanced technology. And there's a moment when he describes um an object hovering over the Pacific Ocean at night off the coast of Camchatka, which is a Russian secret military base. And there are several Russian naval intelligence vessels uh on the ocean clearly apparently waiting for this object to arrive. And there's a still color image obtained presumably by a US submarine or some kind of surveillance device at sea level which shows a large black triangle floating in the air. Now, the implications of that are actually quite concerning because if it's something the Russians were waiting for, it implies it might possibly be Russian, which begs the question, have the Russians de developed technology ahead of the United States? and is part of the reason for the secrecy surrounding the Immaculate Constellation program and every other aspect of the legacy program is part of the reason for this secrecy because the US doesn't want to admit what we've been saying here on reality check for some time which is that there is a grave risk that we are being overtaken by our foreign adversary rivals because of the secrecy surrounding this issue. Many scientists in the program have been telling me for some time that the secrecy in this program is confounding advancements that could give America a foreign adversary advantage. And this is the issue. There is a genuine concern in the scientific community in the black world that we are shooting ourselves in the foot. And this is something that President Trump needs to respond to. The big question in my mind is I look I'm pretty sure I've actually engaged communications with Matthew Brown previously. Um I suspect he reached out to me at one stage last year and we did have preliminary conversations and I know he was at the time incredibly nervous and trying to wrestle with what he was going to do. At the time he wasn't going to go public on TV. So, it's a big step that he's made this move and I can only assume it. He's done it for the best of motives. The man is a patriot. He's a good human being. He needs to be protected as he's revealed in his interview with Chris Sharp for Liberation Times and also the one with um uh George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell. Actually, Chris took his stuff from George and Jeremy's interview. He's concerned about retaliation. He's concerned about threats. and he's also concerned about the possibility that he could even be executed for revealing what he knows. This is serious stuff. Congress needs to do something about it. We can't have a situation where, as has happened with Jake Barber and David Grush, Congress just goes and moves on. This has to be investigated. This is a senior person in a in a senior government position with a top secret compartmentalized security clearance revealing things that rave raise grave concerns about America's national security. Let's get it investigated. Let's put him in front of a public hearing and let's also find out why he wasn't allowed to give evidence at the hearing that took place last year because my understanding is that he was hoping he would have been able to. Let's protect this person. Let's let our Congress people and our senators know that the revelations of this person matter and the White House needs to do something about what he's said. Well said, Ross. Our next question comes about another whistleblower um from Lizzy. Hi guys, first thank you for all your incredible work and ongoing efforts in this field. I have been following intently since the start and support you all the way. My question is what has happened to the age of disclosure documentary with Lou Alzando. It seems to have never been released, fallen off the face of the earth and no one's talking about this. There's also been no updates from Lou. Ross, can you fill us in? What do you know? What's happened and why? Thank you. Okay. So, there was a premiere of the Age of Disclosure documentary at the South by Southwest festival and the producer who uh is one of the co-executive producers on Age of Disclosure, Dan Farah. The other executive producer is actually Lou Alzando. Um the the producer Dan Farah made it very very clear that he would be seeking ideally a cinematic release or some kind of streaming release. And sadly these things take time. You you have to find a um uh a a a cinema chain or indeed a streamer that is prepared to pay the money to run the documentary. And I I agree. I think that it's taking unnecessarily long time. There's huge public interest in this issue. One of the things that I know is featured in the documentary and we know this because it's been written about by people who've seen the film, I think Marrick von Renamp has written about how a former CIA director James Clapper or maybe he was DNI director of national intelligence um has actually gone public with what he knows about a non-human intelligence. This is far too important for this to sit on the shelf for the next few years waiting for a cinematic release. Let's get it out as fast as possible. I do think um I can understand and I sympathize with Dan and Lou in their efforts to try and get release for this film. Um I just hope it comes out very soon. I share your frustrations. I'm aware of what's in the film. I know it makes extraordinary dramatic allegations from first person very very senior people who've worked at the highest levels of government and national security and intelligence and I think it's time the public saw the film but one of the problems we have and this is something I'm facing as well is in Hollywood a lot of the producers have their heads up their butts on this issue of UAPs they are really resistant to giving it the coverage that it deserves. And even though you, the public, the watching public, think this is a story, and by golly, I know the level of public interest in this issue, as a journalist, I have never in my long career as a journalist covering any subject of interest. I have never ever had the degree of public interest in an issue as much as I have on the UAP issue. It's taken me, it's taken News Nation completely by surprise. and we're very gratified by it. It's why we have a show like this. We know there is an audience out there that wants this story and by golly, we're going to bring it to you and I'm sincerely hoping that Dan and Lou get an opportunity to run Age of Disclosure very soon. By the way, gents, if you would like an arena to run it, we would be very, very happy to run it on NewsNation. I can guarantee you a slot. We will run it tomorrow for you. So there's the offer. All right. Next question comes from Ruben. Hi Ross. I grew up LDS Mormon in an area filled with NASA Loheed and Boeing employees. And an old friend once mentioned that her son who worked for the Navy said they preferred hiring Mormons for sensitive positions because of their lifestyle. Given that background, have you ever heard of any connections between the church and the UAP phenomenon? Thank you. Wow, this is such a good question and I'm dying to answer this one. Yes, I have. Mormons are incredibly over represented in the program in the legacy program. I have lost count of how many people that I've met uh who are working in the legacy program who are people of Mormon background and they're great people. And I just wonder whether it's got something to do with the fact that Joseph Smith when he received the um forgive me if I've got my my narratives wrong. Call them tablets or or um metal sheav. The the whole story of Mormonism is based around the idea that Joseph Smith was basically given a lot of the early ideas of Mormonism in metal tablets that were provided to him by a UFO. So maybe for people of faith, the idea of being able to verify this by getting involved in the legacy program is important. I'm told also by more cynical people inside the program that there is in fact a very good reason for using Mormons and it's because they are extremely good at keeping secrets. I can assure you that not all of the Mormons are keeping secrets. Some of them very kindly are speaking to me. So yes, uh there is definitely a link between the Mormons and people involved in the program. I I don't know 100% why, but I suspect it's largely because some of the hidden facilities underground are in Utah. I'll leave it at that. Um, you might be aware for those of you that follow my Twitter that I have flagged recently that we are doing a story that will be touching on the significance of secret underground facilities across the United States, in particular in one state, and you might just want to keep an eye out for that. You'll be starting to see promos very, very soon. We intend discussing the location of a known underground defense facility that we believe is involved working with retrieved nonhuman technology. Okay, Ross, this next question is coming from JP. Hello. Here is my question for the next Q&A with Ross. Hey, Mr. Big Dog, and I assume he's referring to you here. Last week, you touched on the Harold Malgam interview on Jesse Michaels. To me, one of the most fascinating revelations was the connection between the Angletons and the Knights of Malta. What are your thoughts on the Knights as it pertains to the UFO mystery? And where could we begin to find out more? Thank you. Oh, boy. Now, this is a goodie. Now, look, I was privileged enough to be able to speak to Harold through his uh daughter Pipper before he passed. And yes, I am aware that Harold had a real focus on the role played by the Vatican, which after all is the body that essentially uh gives agency to the Knights of Malta. and um he believed very very strongly that the Vatican was in this subject matter up to its ears, particularly the retrieval of the magenta 1933 UFO craft that was retrieved by the fascist Mussolini government and eventually secretly handed over to the Americans. And I understand the interesting thing is you got to know a little bit about your American espionage history. Alan Dulles, who went on to become the um uh director of the CIA at one of its worst times when it committed some of its worst criminal acts right through to the horrible revelations that came in during the Church Commission uh in the 1970s. Alan Dulles was based in Switzerland during World War II and he was part of the OSS, the precursor to the CIA. And so we know that Dulles was involved with the Vatican and the Knights of Malta in that retrieval. And we also know that James Jesus Angleton who went on to become the notorious counter inelligence boss of the CIA. He was in Milan. So you had two of the people who are principally involved in some of the dirtiest secrets of the CIA working for the OSS at this time in the late uh mid1 1940s when the knowledge of the magenta craft was passed on to uh the Americans by the Vatican. And yes, it's central to what Harold Mongram alleges that the Knights of Malta are involved. And one of the things if you actually go through the number of people who are members of the Knights of Malta, it is mindblowing. If you look at senior people in the air force, senior people in government, there are an incredible number of connections involving the Knights of Malta. And yes, it has crossed my mind that when you have people like Matthew Brown, for example, the latest whistleblower, talking about how this is an internationalist cabal of people, are they using the Knights of Malta as cover? And is the Vatican involved in assisting this cover up? I think they are. And I've long thought the Vatican is much more involved in protecting this secret than people care to admit. Multiple sources have told me, even though the Vatican denies this, that the Vatican has long been aware of non-human intelligence and that their files, their archives are replete with details of UFO sightings, UAP craft sightings going back as long as a thousand years. If there is one institution in the world that sits outside of the American National Security State that's the most likely suspect for facilitating how this happens, it's the structure of the Knights of Malta and the Vatican. And I do not think it is any coincidence that Dulles, Angleton, and a plethora of people, including people who are serving in the US National Security Establishment right now, are members of the Knights of Malta. Um, supposedly it's just an honorific title and just a fancy title that you can put after your name. But is it? That's what I'm investigating and I'm very very interested in hearing from anybody who has any more information on this. Okay, our next couple questions. These are coming from the Rendlessham Forest interview that we posted last week. Hello Ross. Watched your interview with Carrie Hesseline. Fascinating interview. Ross, do you think the Pentagon or some rogue organization funded by black projects is abducting and terrorizing people with the Milabs military abductions that happen from time to time? What do you think the purpose of such an operation is and its end goals if true? Okay, so there's two issues here. There's the Rendlessham case of December 1980 and there's the issue of what are called myabs, military abductions. And it's long been a part of UFO UAP mythology that the US military is somehow secretly involved in abducting people and for some reason assisting non-human intelligence beings entities in some kind of scientific study or activity with abducted humans. I for the life of me don't know if that's true or not. What I can tell you is I've spoken to multiple people who claim to have been victims of my lab abductions and I I I don't know what to make of the abduction phenomenon. I've recently interviewed Jacques Valet who has speculated about this in his forbidden science journals and you'll see my interview with Jacqu Valet shortly. What is interesting is there is a commonality. There is a theme to a whole lot of people from all over the world who are describing being in this kind of weird realm where they're allegedly being abducted. There are alien beings there allegedly. And there are men in uniform, American military uniform. And this isn't just one or two people that have spoken to me about this. This is dozens of people. There's a huge commonality to these reports. Let's go to Rendlessham. I do think there was American involvement in prompting what happened at Rendlessham Forest in December of 1980. Increasingly, I am led to the view that there was an operation underway. I've been aware for some time that a huge C5 Galaxy uh aircraft arrived several weeks before the Rendlessham Forest incident at RAF RAF Woodbridge, which is one of the two Royal Air Force bases that were in use at the time by as a joint American British base. And I'm told that there was a special tarmac set aside that was strengthened for the C5. Oh, and by the way, it was at the very end of the Raph Woodbridge base, right adjacent to the Rendlessham Forest. And yes, there are witnesses that I'm aware of who, for various reasons, were able to pass through the forest at that time, and they saw activity underway. It has also been suggested to me, and this has been fairly recent, that there was a psionic summoning operation being operated experimentally at Rendlessham at this time. And that what the United States was doing was using people with alleged telepathic psionic abilities to try to summon and perhaps operate a craft, a nonhuman craft. And it has been suggested to me that what happened at Rendlessham was what's called a link loss. That whoever the psionic was that was operating the craft, they lost the link. And that might explain why the craft landed briefly in the forest and then was able to then be retrieved. It took off eventually whilst allegedly people were watching it. And this happened apparently over multiple nights. I'm intrigued by the Rendlessham case and I'm looking forward to a film that's being made at the moment called Cattle Green which is going into some of this detail. Uh I'm very excited to be able to see that film hopefully later in the year. Uh I'm also hoping to talk in more detail to Colonel Charles Halt who has contacted me recently and expressed an interest in wanting to give more detail on what he knows. hoping to speak to him shortly and maybe we can bring him on reality check. So yes, my labs are interesting. I don't think Rendlessham was a case of a military alien abduction. What I do think it was though was an incident where there was allegedly a psionic link loss. And that's telling because if it was happening in 1980, that's 45 years ago. 45 years ago, they were using psionics to engage with non-human craft. Think about that. Think about what they might have achieved in the 45 years since. All right, Russ. This next question comes from Tristan. Is anyone ever going to mention the Todd Mortyn case that same year? I think that case is as significant as it is so multiaceted, not far away, and around the same period. Wow. I'm so pleased somebody's asked me about the Todd Mortyn case. I'm I'm a West Yorkshire boy. I was born in West Yorkshire where Todd Mortyn is located and I've always been interested in this case. So there was a copper there was a policeman called um Alan Godfrey and in June of 1980 he was involved in a really weird case where the dead body of a man called Adam Demsky, I can't remember his first name. It wasn't George Adamsky. A dead body of a man called Adamsky from memory was found on the top of a a kind of a coal slag heap in this mining town called Todd Morton. And apparently he was buck naked and his hair had been shaved and um there was a real mystery as to how this guy had gone missing. He'd been missing for 3 days and there was never any explanation for what had happened. roll forward to I think it was November of 1980, which is one month just a few weeks before the Rendlessham case. What was happening? Um Alan Godfrey himself was on patrol in the town of Todd Morton and what he describes is I think he was responding to something about I mean this is a farming town, mining town. There were cattle apparently that were wandering around the town and so he went to investigate and I can't remember the full details but apparently he was abducted and that's the that's the account that he gives. I'm hoping at some stage to be able to bring Alan Godfrey on the show not least because I love his Yorkshire accent and I've heard him interviewed before. I'm fascinated with the Todd Morton story because you've got this death involving a man found on top of a slag heap in June of 1980 and then in the November almost getting towards the same time as the Rendlessham incident, you've got this weird thing that happens to a policeman where he's allegedly abducted. Um, I'm fascinated with the case and I've heard Alan tell his story before and I find him highly credible. All right, Ross, thank you. That is all the time that we have for today.

    "question": "Well, good day and welcome to Reality Check Q&A, the question and answer where you guys get to ask me the hard questions. And here to help me through it this week yet again, my friend and colleague Megan Order. How are you, Megan?",
    "answer": "Ross, I'm just fantastic. How are you this week?  I'm good. I'm good. I've got a mildly sore eye. Okay, I got something in my eye, but apart from that, I'm passing mustard.  All right. Well, we will not take it easy on you like normal.  Yeah, be kind. Be kind to me.  We'll see. Let's start here, though. Um, we have an article from NPR that we'd love to get your comments on. They're saying a classified network of SpaceX satellites is emitting a mysterious signal. What do you think that could be?  Ah, okay. So, as I understand it, um Elon Musk does do Secret Squirrel stuff at SpaceX with his um satellite launches. And there has been apparently a very highly classified launch of Starlink related satellites called Star Shield. Nobody knows what they're used for. They're apparently part of some classified defense program. And there has been some uh concern that they're normally meant to be used in that frequency band for transmissions from the earth up to a space object. But in this case, the a very clever um uh monitor of these frequencies noticed that there are transmissions coming down from these star shield satellites to Earth. And one can only assume that it's all legitimate and authorized because obviously it's being done in collusion with the defense department. Um it it could be purely and simply that it's something Starlink Star Shield's doing to um to monitor those satellites, data monitoring, or it could perhaps be that they've stumbled across something covert and secretive. But one thing's for sure, the communications are almost certainly encrypted. I certainly hope they are. There was a time once during the Gulf War when encryptions didn't happen on some transponders on some military satellites and people like me were able to see drone feeds from Afghanistan and Iraq. It was a great period for about 3 months and we kept it all secret and we were watching the incredible capacities of these drones and then somebody blabbed and talked about it in the story and revealed all. So, um I don't know any more than that there is a secret uh group of satellites called Star Shield that have been linked by Starlink. They're part of a defense program. I think it's related to the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. That's all I know. If anyone knows any more, please let me know. We'd love to know more.  Okay, great. We are going to move on to one of our other favorite topics, drones. The New York Post put out an article this week and the headline is New Jersey drone and UFO scare solved. Private contractor unveils strange aircraft takes credit for sky mystery.",

  {
    "question": "Okay, look, I I there's been a couple of well-placed stories in the last few weeks trying to I think debunk as much as possible. We had another delivery from Joel Shetman at the Wall Street Journal, who's fast becoming the splenetic debunker of choice for the defense community and intelligence community. And we had a well-placed New York Post story which quoted an unnamed contractor uh who was um presenting uh a claim that some craft the nature of which is not revealed was responsible for the 2024 New Jersey sightings where people were saying that they were seeing UFOs. And the New York Post gave this which is a tabloid newspaper which means it gives things a bit of stick as we say in media. It gives stories a good thrashing. Uh it quoted that this was the solution to the New Jersey drone flap and uh it was obviously some kind of classified military technology. Now even if assuming that that's true, let let's assume for a moment that that's true, which I actually don't think it is. I'm sorry. I just do not buy the explanation that came from the White House that these are FAA authorized research drones because we know that General Guilo and General Glenn Van Herk, both former and serving bosses of Northcom NORAD, admitted on the record to both 60 Minutes and in later public comments that they still have absolutely no idea what these New Jersey objects were or are because they are continuing. they're still up there. Moreover, if you actually look at drone sightings, not just in New Jersey, but across the continent of the United States and indeed internationally, let's let's go through it. I've I've got a list here myself. I mean, there are extraordinary numbers of drones that have been um recorded uh all over the world. We've got sightings across the United States, November to December to January 2024, ongoing into this year. New Jersey, New York, thousands of reports of swarms over residential areas, Langley Air Force Base. Are we seriously meant to believe according to this unnamed this anonymous defense contractor that they were hovering over Langley Air Force Base where drone anti- drone technology was used unsuccessfully and that this was all part of some kind of authorized research program. I'm sorry, I'm not buying this. When the Air Force has made it abundantly clear that they had no idea what these objects were over Langley Air Force Base and indeed um uh plant 42 in California and Vandenberg Air Force Base. So, I'm sorry, I'm not buying it. And then you go on, are we honestly saying that this purported drone company that's made this new craft that's the New York Post is putting up as the explanation for the drone reports? Are we saying that it's also responsible for the November flaps over Raph Mildenhal in the United Kingdom, Feltwell, Fairford in Suffk, in Norfolk and Gstersha? There were sightings all over some of the most sensitive British military airspace in the United Kingdom. Are we suggesting that that unnamed drone so-called manufacturer was responsible for those sightings? I mean, the most plausible explanation that's been offered to date without any evidence at all is that it's possible Russian surveillance or some kind of um stealth warfare, hybrid warfare. And this is the favored explanation by a lot of people with military backgrounds, but it's the default explanation. As of right now, late October 2025, we still have no explanation, no definitive explanation at all for any of this purported drone activity. And if you go on, most recently it was in Germany, Denmark, Norway, Poland, broader Western Europe. You had corrupt air base in Denmark. Multiple military sites across Denmark and Norway. Copenhagen airport in Germany. You had Rammstein Air Force Base, NATO bases of Brun, uh Rhin Metal facilities in Germany, Munich airport. I mean, are we seriously suggesting, as somebody who's obviously provided this convenient story to the New York Post is trying to do, that this explains all of these anomalous drone reports? Have you noticed how these purported drone object stories have disappeared off the front page? And yet, I'm still getting messages from people saying that they're seeing these objects in and around facilities. I heard from Beatric Vill, Dr. Beatric Fillerol in Sweden that a group of fishermen just off the coast of Sweden were pillaried by debunkers in Sweden because they had the ghoul to stand up and say that they'd seen anomalous objects over the ocean. And the debunker explanation didn't wash, but that didn't matter. That's what went out in the media. The simple fact is that there is no proper explanation at this date. There has been no recovery of any craft. There has been no identica identification of any nation that is definitely involved. And of course, if it was the Russians, people would say, \"Yeah, this kind of hybrid warfare is done by stealth.\" You know, they're probably very good at concealing it. But if I was the West and I knew it was the Russians and I could prove it was the Russians, I would have done it by now. And I don't think they can because I don't think they have any evidence. And so let's keep the heat up on this drone story because I think the word drone itself is an attempt at ethmological determinism. They're trying to mold what the public thinks about these objects before we've even reached a conclusion about them. They are objects of unknown origin. Yes, some of them have been aircraft that people have misidentified, but it's becoming abundantly clear that the military and civilian authorities right across Europe have acknowledged that they cannot identify these objects or find their source or track them back to source. Same thing in America. uh two generals, very senior Northcom Norad generals, made a definitive statement that they had absolutely no idea where these objects coming from or what they are and they were penetrating airspace, including highly sensitive national security installations with impunity. And it worries me that so much of the national media, including the New York Post in this case, just glibly accept the anonymous, off therecord assertions made by a purported manufacturer of a purported new craft. In my job, you've got to test these allegations more. I'd be looking for more evidence before I made a claim like that. I do not think that this purported craft satisfactorily explains all of the purported drone sightings that have been occurring. End of rant.",
    "answer": "Well, unfortunately, the rant is going to continue because Kevin from Canada has a question on this topic. Good morning to you both. Do you think that the reason we do not have as many UIP sightings in Canada is because we do not have nuclear weapons? Specifically, I'm talking about the drone sightings. Really enjoy your show. I was happy to see some Canadian content. Thank you, Kevin.  That's a good question, Kevin. I mean, it would be speculative on my part, but yes, I do suspect that what these objects are focusing on quite often, it appears to be facilities where there's almost a likelihood that nuclear weapons or um technology related to nuclear weapons or highly sensitive such military technology would likely be stored. Uh the Copenhagen airport one, for example, is a mystery. That's an exclusion there. U I I do think that maybe something's doing a show. Uh there have been, by the way, objects seen over Canada. I've had correspondents from around Toronto. Um there are objects being seen in Canada, but certainly not with the frequency or intensity that's being seen just across the border in the USA. But yeah, I take your point. There is definitely a link between UAPs and nuclear facilities and nuclear weapons.  Okay, there are some other big news that has come out. The film The Age of Disclosure, um they are posting on X and everywhere else that their film is finally being released. It's going to come on November 21st worldwide, Prime Video, and in select US theaters. Um viewer question here from Baz Ball. Hi Ross, with Age of Disclosure releasing soon, do you think it will move the needle for disclosure still after being delayed for a couple of years along with pretty high prices to buy on Amazon? Also, do you think that there's a chance of David Crush's oped ever coming out?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Okay, there's two questions there. Let me deal with the David Grush one first. I don't think I'm giving anything away if I say I think there's going to be a David Grush interview coming up soon, like a a TV interview. Uh, that's to come. Let's just wait and see what happens there. As for the op-ed, that's up to the mainstream media organizations that appear to be doing their level best to try and suppress this story. Um, I certainly know David's been very keen to get his viewpoint out there. Uh, hence the new interview. um on the age of disclosure. Wow. My favorite quote from this is Jay Stratton, the former head of the UAP task force in the Pentagon. And he says, \"As a firsthand witness,\" and it's in the trailer. You would have seen it from the beginning of this year. I have seen with my own eyes nonhuman craft and nonhuman beings. Doesn't get any more definitive than that. For the life of me, I do not know why Congress hasn't put Jay Stratton under oath in the public hearing or in a private hearing and deposed him to find out what he knows. I suspect he probably has given private evidence, but I'd love to see him in the public arena. Maybe the simple fact is that Congress is playing along with the attempts by the national security state to keep all this under wraps and a lot of what's being done in Cong Congress is titled to try and amuse us pe people in the public arena to stop us from asking too many questions. Um the age of disclosure is going to be a very very important documentary. It's going to air both as a theatrical release but it's also going to be aired I think on Netflix and that's huge. Oh, it might be Amazon. Hang on. I'm not quite sure. Don't quote me there.",

    "question": "But it's [clears throat] got Lu Lzando, Jay Stratton, as I've just mentioned, Hal Putoff, Eric Davis. Now, Eric's important because of course he's the astrophysicist physicist who had the conversation with Admiral Tom Wilson, the former deputy DIA boss at the time, uh, who had basically, uh, had the problems trying to get access to the legacy program. and he set out allegedly in um detail to Dr. Eric Davis what he knew about the legacy program, the retrieval program and the cover up and the attempts to reverse engineer. That's that of course is a highly disputed memo. There's another person by the way we could call call Dr. Dave Davis and call Admiral Tom Wilson, put them under oath and see how they answer it. Marco Rubio is also appearing which [clears throat] is quite something. I mean, this is the right-hand man to the president uh Marco Rubio, Secretary of State and also um national security director uh since the previous director left in ignity. Uh and he presumably has been briefed into the program, which is what I understand has happened relatively recently. There's been a much broadening awareness amongst the Trump administration of just what it is that the Pentagon and intelligence community know about UAPs. The big issue [clears throat] now for all of us is what the Trump administration does with that. Are they just going to roll over supinely and let the national security state tickle their tummy and say, \"Hey guys, we just need to keep this quiet because it's our little secret and we'd be jeopardizing all manner of exciting and expensive projects that we have in defense that, you know, shouldn't be revealed because the public doesn't have a right to know about it. Or are we going to give the public their due and tell them what their money has been being spent on for the last 60, 70 years? Um, one of the other people that's featuring in the age of disclosure is James Clapper, the former DNI, director of national intelligence, and he says some pretty interesting things in the documentary. It's quite significant to get a a former DNI speaking publicly. Chris Melon, of course, is appearing. Senator Mike RS is appearing. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, David Fraver, the retired Navy pilot, Alex Dietrich as well, Ryan Graves, Admiral Tim Galedet, uh, former CIA senior executive Jim Siman, and Colonel, retired Army Colonel Carl Nell. Um, so this is a pretty heavyhitting documentary. Uh, I'm excited. Uh, I do think that, um, uh, there are claims in this film that that haven't been made before. I understand one of the claims is that Russia recovered an 80 foot long tic tac with bodies and directed energy weapons. There's also claim of a Vatican cover up. Um there's also expressed concerns about how Nutin, the Treasury Secretary, was um briefed on economic fallout. And the claim is made that the CIA and the Department of Energy have run the crash retrieval program since 1947 post Roswell that UAPs have indeed disabled nukes that there's been technological risks weaponization justify the the secrecy of the so-called but they demand the release of this information for the purposes of obtaining clean energy and solving climate problems. Um, I I do think it is Disclosure on steroids. It's potentially a hugely significant mainstream film that will reach an audience that to date has not yet engaged with this subject. And I commend Lou Alzando and Dan Farah, who are the joint executive producers who have produced this film. Um, it's great to finally see it getting to air and I sincerely hope it has the effect that it should have. Sadly, I'm not holding my breath because you're seeing already counter articles appearing in stool debunker newspapers like the the Wall Street Journal. Dear old Joel Shepman's cutting out the usual tired old lines and doing his level best to try and anticipate the release of this kind of film to try and play down in the public mind that there's anything to this UAP subject. Why on earth do journalists allow themselves to be so produced and manipulated by the national security state? Our job is to poke a greasy finger in the eyes of power and cause as much mischief as possible to tease and question power not to be supplicant lick spittles. Enough said. Thank you, Megan.",

    "question": "Thank you, Ross. Um, let's go to a question from UFO Jack. Is Ross involved in any efforts getting individuals of wealth to donate money so physical security can be provided to whistleblowers that actually have evidence of UFOs? It's clear Congress won't.",
    "answer": "Wow. Gee, I wish I could just dial me up a billionaire. It'd be fantastic. Uh uh look, I actually don't think the issue is the necessity to provide personal security to these people, although that is an issue. I mean, there are some people that are fearing for their personal safety. And I do believe that some people have been threatened, hurt or indeed murdered to protect this secret. So yes, personal security is an issue. The bigger issue is frankly the fact that Congress has completely failed to date to implement the laws that are needed to protect these whistleblowers when they come forward. It's hugely frustrating. I've spoken to people in the Senate uh in the House who ask me to help them bring forward people with direct firsthand knowledge of the retrieval and reverse engineering program. And when I approach these people, they quite sagely point out to me that the are not the protections particularly for contractors. Yes, there are protections for people serving in the military who come forward. But if you're a contractor, and most of this is kept in secret in private contractor aerospace companies, you are not protected. You do not enjoy the whistleblower protections. And that's why the UAP Disclosure Act uh laws that were being sought to be implemented within the National Defense U appropriations, that was why it was so important. Now, I'm told we should all be heartened by uh Representative Eric Berles's announcement on the weekend at the um New Paradigm Institute's uh disclosure conference that I was a part of. Eric, uh, Representative Eric Berles revealed that he has agreed to co-sponsor the same UAP disclosure laws as a standalone bill, which is a wonderful piece of news. And sorry to sound nerdy and legalistic for a moment, but this is important. It's important because it means there's still a possibility that these laws could be put before both the Senate and the House and that we could get disclosure laws um into the law which would protect these whistleblowers. That's what's needed most of all. Yes, in some cases people do need personal security protection. But the thing that's most needed is for these people to feel that their jobs, their pensions, their livelihoods, their families won't be jeopardized if they come forward with evidence that reveals illegality, impropriy involving the expenditure of monies in breach of the constitution. Now, that's the issue that's, you know, first and foremost right now. and we need to ensure that we have those legislative protections in place to protect those people. When we've got those, I'm very confident people are going to come forward. They're just waiting for Congress to do its job. The simple fact here is there's two problems. We've got staffers in Congress. There are some very good staffers, some of whom I speak to regularly, who are genuinely committed to disclosure and getting this issue out there because they recognize it's real. They've heard from witnesses in camera in skiffs and they know that there is this cover up involving crash retrievalss and reverse engineering. But the problem is there are also staffers and some of them are more powerful than some of these committees who frankly are self-interested. All they want is a cozy well-paid job in private enterprise and some rich beneficent private aerospace contractor when they get out of political service in Congress. And so while they're serving their politician, they have a second master or mistress, they are serving the supplicant interests of the private aerospace manufacturers that come to lobby them. And how hard is it for them to resist the intreaties of a private aerospace company that says to them, \"Hey, listen. It would really help if you could bury this UAP disclosure stuff. It's not helping. make that one go away and we'll give you a cushy 500,000 bucks a year job at Northrup Grumman or Loheed Martin. That's how it works. Um the other issue frankly is the congressmen and the senators. They're not doing their job. They are not waking up to the significance of an issue that really is the biggest story in human history and should be the biggest issue of concern before the Congress. If it is true that technology recovered from nonhuman beings is in the possession of private aerospace companies and sections of the US military and intelligence community. That is the biggest story ever. It should dominate the concerns and the policy concerns of every legislature, every representative, every senator in Congress. And it's not. Why not? Because they're being got at too. They're all a bunch of self-interested corrupt swine. A lot of them frankly I just find it disgusting how corrupt American politics is and how supine so many senators and so many representatives are to the intreaties of the private aerospace industry and the national security establishment. Um yes there are some good honorable senators and representatives and we all know who they are. Uh Tim Burchchett, um Eric Bison come to mind, um Anna Paulina Luna, um these are good people doing their level best as fairly junior representatives to try and push back against the bulwick of secrecy and conspiracy. Um yes, there is a conspiracy to conceal this from the public and at the moment they're winning. So let's get those disclosure laws passed and let's protect these whistleblowers and let's get this evidence before the Congress. Okay, Russ, we have a question coming in on X from Dave. He wants to know, \"Hi, Megan and Ross. What is your reaction to the news mentioned earlier today by Ryan Graves that Beatatric Viller's fascinating paper on transients in Earth in Earth orbit pre-1952 has been rejected by Arvix because it is quote not of interest.\"  Okay, this is a complex issue. Actually it's quite interesting bit of gossip that Avix it's a technical paper manuscript publication preprint preprint publication platform and it was actually created by DOE department of energy scientists that that's the the guys from the dark side by the way these are probably people from the um the legacy program uh at Los an uh Los Alamos nuclear laboratories years and years ago as a way of providing their papers in a pre-print form before they were published to their colleagues. And it's turned into quite a useful way for academics to share their papers and it's probably the most gone to academic citation reference platform in the world. Now, um let's be very clear. Uh Dr. Beatric Volarol has achieved what I thought was the absolute impossible. she has managed to achieve publication in a peer-reviewed platform which is part of the nature group. I I think it's um scientific papers which is part of the incredibly prestigious nature platform uh published by the Springer organization um to achieve peer review for papers related to UAPs or touching on the UAP subject is mindblowingly momentous and significant. It's a huge achievement. But it does appear that from what Dr. Villa Roll is saying [snorts] someone is at the very least at Arvex which is also used as a platform to get these things out there. They're they're kind of dragging their feet a little now. I'm not sure if it's actually being blocked. It Avix isn't actually a publication platform. It's a pre print prep pre-print platform for unpublished manuscripts. Um, I mean, in the scheme of things, this isn't really that important because her two papers have been published in prestigious scientific journals, peer-reviewed journals, and to get the authoritative stamp of a platform that's within the Nature group of companies, which has rigorous peer review is quite something. It's a huge, I think, turning point, tipping point in the coverage of UAP related issues. Um the problem is that ARVIX is where physicists and astronomers share preprints and if a paper is not there it's almost it doesn't exist. It serves as the central hub for open scientific exchange where unpublished newly accepted and even rejected manuscripts is shared so that other researchers can sort of read and test and build upon the work. Now, um it looks like um both of the accepted and peer-reviewed papers have been rejected from the ARVIX server and it from what Beatric has told me in one case she was told to replace an older work and the other she was told that the research was not of interest to Avix. Um she's made the comment that empirical results, peer review and publication in highquality journals are no longer enough to satisfy the gatekeepers. Scientists are being prevented from reading new results. The UFO stigma remains strong. And she quoted Beatatric posted in her um tweet she posted the ARVIC's response to one paper which does appear to suggest that they've refused to publish it. Thank you for submitting your work to Avix. We regret to inform you that Arvix's moderators have determined that your submission will not be accepted and made public on arvix.org. Our moderators determined that your submission does not contain sufficient original or substantive scholarly research and is not of interest to Arvex. Um, now I think if that's the case, if it really is Arvix making the determination that this is not scholarly research and not of interest, then somebody on Arx is dragging their feet. And you have to wonder, is this related at all to the previous association with um, Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratories and the Department of Energy? Is there some scientist with a stick up his ass inside Artics who's trying to stop people becoming aware of UAP related papers? Um, if there is that kind of obstruction or dragging of feet inside ARVIX, I strongly suggest that they review their decision because it's going to become a major media issue if this kind of obstruction continues.",

    "question": "Okay, Russ, we have a couple fun things that we want to end with. Here is a question from email our this is our friend Daniel. Hey Ross, this is not a UAP or NHI question, but what's with the picture of the gorilla on the wall behind you in the October 19th, 2025 reality check Q&A? Is there an interesting story backstory to this? Just curious. Thanks and keep up your dogged investigations into the UAP phenomena. Daniel in Virginia.",
    "answer": "Oh, Daniel, I'd love to say it was some s some some very clever literary illusion. What it was was a bit of 1970s kit in a uh beautiful motel in a beautiful part of rural Australia where I was doing some filming some research for a future UAP related documentary. And uh when I'm on the road, I can't take my usual set with me. And so I used a hotel room. You might have seen a pillow on the bed there. I was in a hotel room and uh that just happened to be the most extraordinary photograph. and I put it there as a bit of a joke to see if anybody would notice and I'm glad you did. But no, there's no UAP related story to that. It's just a bit of fun.  It was a very cool picture.  But speaking of um gorillas, there there's an interesting connection to you, Megan, and I hope somebody's asked you about that because I saw something that you posted or reposted on Twitter that I think you need to explain.",

    "question": "Yeah, I I love that you emailed this to me. Um, I saw this when I logged into work on Monday morning. There is an ex account and it is called Bigfoot Disclosure Diaries and um, I was inspiration for one of their videos. I I think it's best if we just roll it out.",
    "answer": "Are you going to show it here? I hope you do.  Why not?  What's up, guys? Foot here with the Q&A lady. You're a breath of fresh air in the UFO community, Megan. Not only do you have sweet smelling perspirationfree pits, you just throw your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care. [laughter]  So that is I I presume that's very clever use of AI. Is that the case?  Yes, correct. This is 100% AI. Um but Ross, nothing to me screams you've made it other than Bigfoot in your library with you. So  how do we know? How do we know, Megan, that that's not real and that you're part of the cover up? That basically you really do have a big foot in your living room and and this is all part of Megan or being responsible for the continuing cover up about crypted creatures. [laughter]  I can promise you this. If I was going to use AI to make myself look really cool, um the first thing I would not have them say is that I have perspirationfree pits. [laughter]  I did feel for you at that point. Yeah. Um, it's interesting though because  I it's you looked great by the way, but one thing I do want to point out is that is a good illustration of just how incredibly clever AI is becoming and why we at Reality Check have to be incredibly scrupulously careful with any kind of video or imagery that's provided to us by people of purported UAP or paranormal objects. I I must get every day two or three clearly AI generated images. And what gives them away often is that they are just so realistic, so hyper realistic. And I I don't know how we're going to fix this because a as AI gets better and better. It's only a matter of time before convincing AI UAP imagery gets put into the public domain only eventually to be debunked. I'm just wondering whether there's a case to be argued that the AI companies that provide these technologies should perhaps be required to put some kind of blockchain signature into their AI algorithms so that one can automatically define whether something is an AI generated image or not because this is a huge issue. I mean, if somebody can fake a Bigfoot with you, Megan, they can make a politician look like they're taking a bribe or caught in an in a compromising sexual position or something like that. And and it can be used for um public exposure and vilification. So, there's a reason why we do need to be able to verify imagery. And your experience with Bigfoot is a great example.",

    "question": "All right, we will start with Rod who's got some comments about NASA. Dear Ross, recently Dr. Gregory Rogers, a former NASA chief flight surgeon and Air Force major, has given public testimony detailing an event from 1992 where he claims he was shown CCTV footage of a craft he described as a quote flying saucer inside a hanger at Cape Canaveral. Most remarkably, he states, \"The craft bore a US Air Force insignia.\" However, his story has received surprisingly little in-depth coverage compared to other whistleblowers. My question for your Q&A is, would you consider investigating his claims further and potentially interviewing him?",
    "answer": "You're absolutely right. Uh I his story is important. I met Dr. Gregory Rogers very briefly at Contact in the Desert in May this year. He's a lovely bloke and I find him very persuasive. I heard him speak and I think the story he tells is very important and frankly anyone of his stature I mean he was a former chief surgeon or such like for NASA at Cape Canaveral that's a very senior position the fact that he's willing to speak out and say what he saw says an enormous amount and basically my my one issue with what he says is he's not saying he saw directly a craft He's saying he saw CCTV of a craft, which is the point, you know, a very very important point because a lot of people, a lot of debunkers and skeptics have suggested that he was just shown a fake video or that, you know, how can he be certain that what he saw was real? I'm reasonably confident that there are such craft being operated using US Air Force insignia. And the reason why I believe Dr. Rogers is because of what I've been told by a source who frustratingly won't go on camera, but who did tell me a story about what he saw at Eglund Air Force Base in Florida. And uh it was very very similar. It was a gigantic um elliptical craft, massive, apparently uh 20 30 m wide, hovering in a clearing at Eglund Air Force Base, clearly being attended to by both unformed and suited men. Uh, and in the moment that he was standing there looking at it as he was having a a covert cigarette, uh, hidden away from view, he literally saw the object blink from sight. Literally, he blinked and it disappeared. It was that fast. It It disappeared. There was a momentary shutter of the trees, presumably by the displacement of air underneath the object. But whatever it was, it was some kind of craft using a propulsion system that we know not what. Uh, which was being operated at a US Air Force base in Florida. So, I I've got enough data points to tell me that what people like Dr. Gregory Rogers are saying is accurate. And I do think that we need to start taking these allegations seriously. the possibility that the United States is operating ARVs, alien reproduction vehicles. Um, I cite also the Mike Herrera story where Michael Herrera, a young US Marine, was on a patrol in Indonesia during a civilian uh crisis and evacuation during a disaster and he came across a craft hovering in a clearing that was clearly being protected, guarded by paramilitary US accented military personnel. They weren't very friendly to him either. Um, so why do I take Dr. Gre Rogers seriously? Because there is a plethora of information to suggest that there's something to this. Um, yeah, at some stage I'd love to get Dr. Rogers onto reality check. I guess what I'd like to do is take the story further. Um, we we try on the program to report what's being reported and I do think it's important to acknowledge good men like Dr. Rogers who've come forward and given their evidence. But when they've been as he has been, he has actually been fairly widely interviewed across a whole breadth of different podcasts and shows. I'd like to try and find a new angle and we try we always try and find a new way into the story and I've got one in mind and at some stage I might bring him on.",

    "question": "Okay, we will go next to an email from Jeppy. Hello, thank you for your hard work on the UFO subject. Have you tried C5 contact yourself? If so, how many times? And have you gotten any results? I was able to get results by myself after a few failed attempts. But after that, it became quite easy. It became quite easy and common. I would recommend Greer C5 protocol, which is quite simple and easy to learn. Okay. C5, for those of us who don't know, is close encounters of the fifth kind where purportedly using meditative, telepathic, psychical techniques, one is able to get oneself into a position where you can invite perhaps summon a non-human intelligence or craft or orb or whatever it is to come into your view. And have I done it? I've certainly tried it. I haven't done it successfully. In fact, I've been a miserable failure. But I certainly have witnessed it. I've witnessed it now twice. Um, I saw it only about probably seven or eight weeks ago in Northern Victoria at a place called Ruther Glenn in a place called Ga Sanctuary run by an Australian called Peter Maxwell Slatterie. And um, it's quite funny actually. Peter said to me during the daytime, he said, \"I've got a feeling we're going to see stuff tonight.\" And we were standing in darkness looking out probably to the west from his beautiful property. And as we were standing there, he was meditating and inviting them to come. And he he's done a lot of work like this at Mount Chester in California. And I was skeptical to be perfectly honest. And maybe my skepticism is part of the problem. But as I watched, there were clearly dots that became orbs that moved closer and closer towards us. In some cases, hovered just behind trees, probably no more than a few hundred feet in front of us. And I can't explain it. They were moving erratically. They weren't satellites. They weren't planes. They weren't drones. They weren't fireflies. They weren't birds. there was some kind of object that appeared to respond intelligently to Peter's invitations for them to come closer. And on a couple of occasions when he invited them to pulse up, that was the kicker for me. Um, they literally flashed. I can't explain it. And I've seen the same thing before. I think I've talked about this before at which is just down the coast from San Francisco. a beautiful place if you ever get the opportunity to visit. It's a serene location sitting on the Pacific Ocean high above the Pacific Ocean run by um uh a lot of beautiful people who spend their days meditating and thinking about spiritual things. It was a privilege to be invited there and um I was there with one of the psionics who's been now involved with Skyatcher and he actually said to me at 4:00 in the afternoon while it was still daytime. He said, \"Ross, we're going to see a blue orb tonight.\" And he even predicted it might be hexagonal or octagonal. I think he said hexagonal. Anyway, literally later on that night we did. We saw a blue orb. Hundreds people saw a blue orb hovering near a swimming pool where a lot of people were swimming naked and um it was right adjacent to the Pacific Ocean and as people watched it sank down onto the beach and you could clearly see the blue phosphorescent hexagonal shaped orb sitting on the beach. Um, I can't explain it, but whatever it was, the person who summoned it told me that we were going to see it, and we did.",

    "question": "Okay, Ross, we will go to an email from David. Ross, could the secrecy surrounding this phenomenon be associated with the potential manipulation of human DNA? If non-human entities walk among us and have altered our genetic makeup, it raises the question of whether certain human populations may might possess a higher proportion of nonhuman DNA than others. If this were the case, disclosure of such information could risk fueling eugenic ideologies or race-based conflict, potentially dividing humanity rather than uniting it. What do you think? Okay, there is no hard scientific evidence, I'm told, to support the idea that there has been manipulation of the human genome. And it's interesting because I've read scientific papers that make this assertion which some of which I think might have been peer- reviewviewed. I mean there was a couple of years ago I got very excited because there was one paper that was published in Eastern Europe which suggested that there were um DNA strands in the human genome that genome that appeared to show some kind of manipulation. And I asked Professor Gary Nolan about this and he poo pooed it and said he didn't think there was much to it. So officially at least science says that there is no evidence of manipulation any artificial manipulation of the human genome. But as many who follow the UAP subject will know it's a long known allegation that NHI whatever they are beings from other areas have been manipulating the human genome and possibly hybridizing humans with alien DNA. I've never been able to see any evidence to support this. Um there's a friend of mine here in Australia called Bill Chalker who's a reputable scientist who's done some great work in a book called The Hair of the Alien. And um he uh interviewed a gentleman called Curi who claimed to have actually been forcibly made to have sex with two Nordic women who turned up in his bedroom. And the interesting thing about this incredible story is that um they found a hair from one of these alleged beings which when tested showed all manner of extraordinarily um weird DNA. Whatever it was, it wasn't entirely normal human DNA. Um there's been an interview done by a friend of mine called Rhys Delton Morgan uh which basically tells this whole story and you can go on and have a look at that. Rhys Dton Moore. Um, as for the claims of ancient genetic engineering, yes. Okay. There are claims, the ancient astronauts theory that posit that extraterrestrials, the anunnaki from Samrian days, genetically altered early hominids like Homo erectus to create homo sapiens as a labor force. And this has been popularized in different shows and books, but essentially there's not a lot of evidence to support it. How do you prove something like this? You know, there's obviously claims that have been made by witnesses about such types of genetic manipulation, but really um uh I was I I did some reading about this recently. There was a um a preprint preprint by a molecular biologist called Max Mayer Kashev Remple and he analyzed 581 family DNA trios from the thousand genomes project and he alleged that approximately 2% showed non-parental insertions um large hapletype swaps on chromosome three, which were inexplicable by natural means or inexplicable by pre990 human tech such as crisper, which does allow gene manipulation. And he made the assertion that this linked to alien manipulation uh including pilot data from self-reported abductee families. Now, his claims have also been attacked and debunked and skepticized. So, frankly, I don't know what to think. If anyone has any hard evidence of alien hybridization, I'm your man. Send it my way.",
    "answer": "Ross, naked people swimming in pools and group Nordic sex. This episode's getting kind of crazy.  Sounds like fun, doesn't it?  Yeah, I thought this was a family show, but um can't wait to see the comments on this one. Thanks a lot. Um here comes Tim in our email. Dear Ross, thanks for your work. Have you investigated the Donaldson case, aka the vertical plane case? Best wishes, Tim.  Ah, the vertical plane case. the um it does sound like a UA UAP craft, but the uh the Doleston messages were these weird messages that somebody apparently had a very early home computer in an old farmhouse in the United Kingdom and they left it on at night and apparently they'd been having all manner of weird poltergeist like phenomena. They'd found footprints, six toaded footprints in the corners of the house in the dusk in the dust and uh there was all manner of weird paranormal telekinesis type phenomena that they couldn't explain. And apparently this is the implausible part of this. Why would a guy from Elizabeth in England know how to operate a home computer? That was always the when I read this book, The Vertical Plane, it talked about how they found messages on their home computer in these Donaldston messages, which were a person writing in Elizabethan English pros. And apparently it was like there were linguists who are familiar with oldie Elizabeth in English and it was absolutely spot-on accurate to the way that people spoke at that time. And whoever it was had typed on the computer a message uh angrily claiming them for taking over his home. And the claim was made or the suspicion was that it was some kind of interdimensional portal where he was somehow able from 15th century England able to tap on a computer keyboard in 20th century England and leave messages for the young couple. Now I I guess I'm thinking about how a caveman would feel if he saw a computer keyboard or a mobile phone. Uh, how on earth would somebody from Elizabeth and England know how to operate a computer and tap a message art? Uh, that was always my problem with the Dolston messages. Um, I did read the book, The Vertical Play. I commend it to people because it certainly baffled a lot of investigators from British UFO groups that went and investigated because apparently some of this phenomena manifested when they were there and they they saw some of this happening. So, uh, a lot of people vouched for the integrity of the couple that owned the house. And I'd actually love to know. I don't know whether it's still happening, but, um, certainly, uh, it was a very interesting British paranormal story, wonderful ghost story, whether it's true or not, where essentially some dude from Elizabeth in England starts leaving messages on an old home computer. And, as far as I know, it was never disproven, but it was never proven either. Okay, we have Carolyn who lives in London reaching out to us on email. Dear Ross, firstly, thank you for all the time and effort you invest in trying to clarify and expose information which is legitimately belongs to humanity per se. I was fascinated by your interview with Jake Barber. He is both courageous and selfless. I understand and endorse his efforts to control the narrative somewhat because I trust him to be rigorous and exercise moral responsibility with the matter of disclosure. I am equally impressed with the journey Brandon Fugle has both enabled and undergone and would thank him. His unnerving and dodge determination is inspiring and is unfortunately what it's going to take. Thank you for your recent interview with him. My question is as follows. It has been evident since the first TV series filmed at Skinwalker Ranch that the phenomena is aware of the intention of investigators. Jake's initiative is enabled by the use of psionics, the deliberate use of intentional thought. In your opinion, would it be productive for Travis and Jake to cooperate by creating a joint but discreet supplementary investigation to help clarify how the physical manifestation is related to the forces of intention and telepathy?  Oh, that's a really interesting question. So, basically, um the idea of um getting collaboration between Travis Taylor from Skinwalker Ranch and Jake Barber who's taken interest in psionics. Um, I can tell you, I don't think I'm giving anything away here. Uh, I can tell you that, um, there is going to be a video coming out, I hope relatively soon, from our friends at uh, at SkyWatcher. Uh that's the uh Jake Barber, Alex Clous um privately funded group that are investigating UAP phenomena and trying to use psionic summoning and the dog whistle to bring UAP objects, craft close in so that they can be videoed, photographed and studied. Um they are doing a study on psionics. Uh they've spoken publicly about this in their previous videos. I think they've done interviews where they've talked about the fact that they are going to be studying telepathy and psionics and um I'm really excited. I'm aware of some of the work that they've been doing and I'm really excited. I'm told they are in the peer review process at the moment and it's taking a lot longer than expected. Um, I am assured there is no cover up underway that they are going to be fully open and transparent and I'm looking forward at some stage to interviewing uh either Alex or Jake or somebody from Skywatcher about it. But um they are tied up in a very rigorous peer review process that is part of their own internal vetting and checking procedures. But at some stage very very soon work that quite exciting work that I'm aware of that they've been doing with telepathy will be being made public. Um uh watch this space.  All right Ross, this viewer is coming from Bali, Indonesia. His name is Steve. Hi Ross and Megan. Thanks for that great interview with Michael Herrera a while ago. Would you consider interviewing ufologist Timothy Alberino who investigated similar suspicious Black Ops militia abducting humans with alien tech down in Peru? Are you familiar with this case? Keep up the good work.  Actually, I have exchanged messages with Tim Alberino and he is on my list. Uh, as we all say, too much reality check is barely enough. And frankly, I just can't keep up with the volume of people that are available to be interviewed and the breadth and magnitude of the stories that we're trying to cover here. It's really exciting. Actually, I'm very much enjoying I I thought where I'm living at the moment, I'd be moving into a quiet, gentle, peaceful retirement in the southern highlands south of Sydney, maybe doing the odd UFO book and maybe doing the odd interview. It's just unbelievable the volume of messages and responses that we're getting from people. It's very, very gratifying. And Tim's one of them. He did some great work. I've watched a few of his shows where he actually went down and investigated claims, particularly claims about the abduction or the attempted abduction of I think a 15year-old teenage girl from a um tribal community in Brazil, Peru. can't remember which place it was, but she told this harrowing story of this being on some kind of levitating platform coming towards her up a slope, grabbing her and trying to abduct her. Quite a frightening story. And um uh if you take this into the context of the chuba chubbers which we've also spoken about with Ronnie Vern Brazilian friend we know that there are claims in tribal communities in both Brazil and Peru often unfriendly beings often using highly advanced technology that try and abduct locals particularly young women. So yeah, Tim Alberino has investigated that and thank you for reminding me. I we should get Tim on. That's a great idea. I'm also in touch with Ronnie Verete who's doing another trip very soon to northern Brazil and we're hoping to bring you a story on that at some stage as well.",

    "question": "Okay. Hi Russ and Megan. Great show. I never miss it and keep up the great work. Question. I know from listening to your recent podcast with guest Dr. Dr. Anna Brady Estz, a scientist, a founding member of a deep tech investment firm, someone who has held directorial positions on many boards that promote learning and investment in science, tech, energy, digital resources, an extremely credible and well-informed individual. The doctor has publicly spoken and confirmed the US and world government's awareness of UAP and that commercial partners are taking the significance and potential of this extremely seriously. This once not so open secret is now not a secret to well-informed business entities. How and when is the knowledge of going of this going to be broadcast to the general public front page stuff I would have thought. Will we now see capitalist greed overcome humanities right now? Kind regards, Matt. Well, sometimes capitalist greed does really clever things and frankly free enterprise is one of the ways that we've been able to develop technologies. And I I just want to applaud Anna Brady Estz for speaking as frankly as she did to us the other day with Sarah Gam about what she saw over the Congress. We had her on to talk about the weird objects that they saw hovering over the Congress the night prior to the UAP hearing before Congress. They didn't quite land on the White House lawn, but they certainly made themselves known. And more prominently, Anna Brady Estis, who's an extremely reputable scientist and very very well-connected in space tech, has spoken out quite prominently on the issue of UAPs. She gave a um May yeah it was May this year May 2025 UAP experts panel briefing to Congress and she described how she co-chared an inter agency working group that included leaders from the NASA space force the department of energy department of health human services and indeed there's a podcast a NASA sponsored podcast that she was involved in that we spoke about in this program and I asked her about it which was just incredible because she had a guy called Richard Bandurich who talked about working with UAP technology and all credit to Anna she makes no secret of the fact that she thinks that there is retrieved technology and that everybody knows it and everybody's talking about it and in her briefing to Congress she noted that this um inter agency group that she was part of um facilitated UAP leading content discussions including indications that there was high government awareness and coordination on UAP data and science. She talked about declassification efforts and said that previously classified or unclassified UAP related work has led to open expert presentations such as inviting specialists to share extended electronamics or dedicated UAP presentations and perhaps Richard Bandurik's presentation that he gave to her podcast was one of them. So this is suggesting that maybe what's happening is that maybe government secrets are slowly being allowed to be revealed through industry discussions such as what she's having. And in the same congressional briefing that she gave in May this year, she actually addressed crash retrievalss, UAP crash retrievals directly. She said, \"Are there crash retrievalss?\" Well, are there crashes? I mean, there's where I live. I mean, a crash seems a lot more interesting than a deer to pick up. And anybody who knows an engineer says the first time you see anything of interest, you're certainly going to reverse engineer it. And I guess this was a very koi way of saying that government and private entities inevitably are going to try and reverse engineer anything that they can retrieve. They would naturally pursue recovery and um analysis of UAP crashes. Um and then she further elaborated. She said, \"Do we just not do certain layering or advancement of certain materials because they've been found in crash retrievals?\" And that appeared again to Coily suggest that there were UAP derived materials that were influencing UF US scientific and engineering advancements. And so I think Dr. Brady Estus has been quite prominent in sticking her head up indicating very very strongly that there is retrieved technology and um on the uh show the good trouble show recently my friend Matt Ford she actually talked about credible sources and high-erforming technologies that have emerged from UAP crash retrievals and she talked about a former CIA director's secret ties to UFOs UAPs and extraterrestrials. And she emphasized how such programs have accelerated innovations in lasers, semiconductors, and energy systems. She was pretty damn clear that she thinks that UAP tech has influenced what we've developed. And she also described widespread sightings of ultra advanced craft that are higher performing, that had been captured on various sensors by innovators in aerospace and energy fields. And she noted that for people that are building the highest performing craft and the highest performing energy, they're not trying to unsee what they've seen. So she implied very very strongly that these observations do challenge human technological limits and point to nonhuman origins. And in the congressional briefing, she revealed that 30 to 50% of innovators in closed rooms share personal UAP experiences. And she framed this as a common phenomenon among scientists rather than a fringe belief. She positioned UAPs as an engineering data analysis problem, not folklore. and she talked about funded private companies developing UAP inspired or UAP adjacent technologies during her National Science Foundation tenure. She was actually on the board of the National Science Foundation. So she's advocated for US national preparedness and stigma for re free research and she told the podcasts that she's spoken to that transparency is essential as quote secret UFO UAP science and technologies are already changing everything through government and entrepreneurial channels. Overall, she basically made it very very clear that the US government and private aerospace are up to their necks in UAP technologies. They're just not telling us about it. And I think it's incredibly significant that somebody of the stature and high reputation of Dr. Anna Brady Estz is willing to speak publicly about this and know that she's not going to suffer stigma, ridicule, or denigration or threats as a result of her speaking out. And maybe that's where disclosure is going to come from because I'm sorry, I don't think it's going to come anytime soon from government. Might come from the CIA. I I noticed and I I keep on hoping that people like John Brennan. I I heard a whisper that the Age of Disclosure documentary is going to be coming out soon, possibly on a limited cinema release and um more broadly possibly on Prime Amazon. But on that, John Brennan, the former CIA director from 2013 to 2017 under Obama, he was very vocal on UAPs. In in um he's in a 2020 interview, he described Pentagon released UFO videos as quite eyebrow raising, emphasizing that while he doesn't know their origins, they warrant serious investigation beyond conventional explanations like foreign adversaries. and he suggested the phenomena might represent a different form of life leaving open the possibility that it's extraterrestrial and I understand he's gone a lot further in what he said in age of disclosure and John Ratcliffe who's the current CIA director he's worth mentioning actually I've made a few notes of what John Ratcliffe have said um he was nominated as the CIA director in late 2024 confirmed by the Senate this year and in public appearances John Ratcliffe, the CIA director, has asserted that UAPs demonstrate quote technologies that we don't have and frankly that we can't defend against. They've been tracked by multiple sensors, including satellites. And he's ruled out the explanation that they might be illusions or drones. He criticized the Biden administration for withholding information, claiming, quote, \"The government has more information than it's sharing.\" and he promised more revelations once declassified. And during his uh DNI tenure when he was the director of national intelligence, Ratcliffe pushed for declassification, noting that there'd been sightings all over the world with no clear explanation. And he's vowed to be more open. So fingers crossed from Tulsi Gabbard and DNI and John Ratcliffe in CIA, we might see a move for greater disclosure because it's sure as hell not going to come from Congress by the looks of it.",

Um, you don't have to buy me a beer, but I'm very happy to have a beer with you. One of the gratifying things about doing this story is when I was on uh 60 Minutes quite often, people would walk up to me in airports and abuse me about my latest story.

I walk through any airport or public space, I'm generally stopped by someone saying how much they love the show, how much they appreciate it.

    "question": "That sounds good to me, Ross. We have a lot of people who are wondering where you were. So, I guess we will start with your trip. We've got a post on X from Gonzalo. He says, \"After visiting the tridactyl corpses and seeing the problems the researchers at the University of Eeka face with the Peruvian government, do you notice how similar it is to the issues in the US disclosure effort except for there the conflict is over physical evidence, not whistleblowers?\"",
    "answer": "Okay, Gonzalo, let me be very clear. At first, um, I was very, very skeptical about the so-called tridactyl beings, objects being real beings, because like a lot of people, I'd swallowed particularly the Reuters news report, which suggested that there were artificial toys, hoax objects that had been intercepted at an airport on their way out of Peru. and it put a stink over the whole thing that quite frankly suggested to me remotely that there was something very smelly or suspicious about these objects. Having seen them for myself, I can't reach at this stage a definitive conclusion. But what I can tell my viewers and listeners is I do not think these are hoax objects. I do not think that they are some kind of constructed artificial object. The scans and indeed the visual inspections that we were allowed to do in three separate locations of three separate groups of beings blew me away. Frankly, they are real, whatever they are. Uh what needs to be done and this is what we're hoping we can do with the story that we will be airing is find scientific researchers who are rigorously independent and determined to do the quality DNA and other forensics testing that allows us to confirm the already independently researched findings that have been done by US, Mexican, and Peruvian scientists, suggesting there is indeed something anomalous about these objects. And yes, I do agree there is a similarity to the way that the issue has been, how does one say this? Sciopt disinformed. I have no doubt at all that someone along the way has been putting down poison for the tridactyl story. I was as fooled as everyone else. I'm not saying definitively that they are alien beings or indeed anything anomalous, but I certainly agree that we've got over a probitative hurdle, which means that they should be properly rigorously investigated. They deserve full scientific investigation. And I'm in no doubt whatsoever about the credibility, the authenticity, and the sincerity of the scientists that we met in IKEA, Lemur, and Kusco. All of whom are desperate to have the research that they've done verified and independently reviewed by some of the world's top scientists. Um, I just wish the US showed as much openmindedness about the issue uh on other issues. uh with the the subjects of UAP in the United States. I can tell you that there are good scientists in South America that genuinely want this issue investigated. They're not bludgeoning me or any other researcher to reach a conclusion. What they want is independent, verified, peerreview research. By golly, that's what we're going to try and help them get. They deserve it. I I think they're authentic and credible people. Let's see whether the objects that they've got uh can be prosaically explained or are they as the evidence perhaps perhaps suggests are they evidence of some perhaps prehuman advanced technology civilization or are they evidence of some ev some civilization that existed contiguously with humans which went largely undiscovered. Some of the evidence suggests they might have lived through to as late as 800 AD, but some of the evidence also suggests that they may be as old as 13,000 plus years. It is mindblowing. And I can tell you, Megan, and dear Reality Check viewers, it blew me away to hold those incredible objects in my hands and look at the complexity of their construction. They are no way artificial objects. They are not toys. They're not hoaxes. Whatever they are, they're real and they need investigation.  Well, we look forward to bringing everybody four plus episodes of your entire trip. Um,  maybe more. Maybe more.  Well, we're going to move on to another huge story that happened while you were gone. Age of Disclosure. It came out. People are seeing it. We've got a question on X from guitar and Jits. Please ask him about Marco Rubio's latest comments on the age of disclosure from the Fox Handy interview with Marco Rubio. His comments don't inspire any confidence.  I agree. I mean, I think frankly uh it's clear Marco Rubio in his interview with Sean Hannity has acknowledged that the interview was done he said three or four years ago. That's not true. It was about two years ago. My understanding is it was the winter of 2023. Um he knew full well what he was saying and I'm told by people close to the project that um uh he was fully aware of the edits and how his views were being represented. Uh it's perhaps unfortunate that now that he's the acting national security adviser as well as the secretary of state I would find it very hard to believe that Marco Rubio has not been briefed readin i.e security briefed into the legacy program. If he hasn't been then that's another reason why the Trump administration needs to take the so-called deep state very very seriously indeed. I I was I was actually frustrated, I'll be honest, with Sean Hennity's interview because I was waiting for him to ask Marco Rubio as acting national security adviser, \"Have you been briefed? Have you been read in or told anything about the UAP legacy program?\" U uh what's his name? Brett Bayer on Fox did an excellent interview recently where he went into some of the detail with um Dave Grush about uh what Dave allegedly discovered uh during his research into the legacy program. There was an open opportunity there for Fox to basically ask the question which is Mr. Acting National Security Adviser, Mr. the guy who advises the president on national security. Have you been briefed on UAPs? And of course, we didn't get that question asked. So, we didn't get that answer. And it worries me because there was the usual kind of nervous titter that happens whenever questions get asked about UAPs. And I don't know why that's the case. The thing that got most people excited about Marco Rubio's um statements was that uh Michael Shelonburgger, a friend of this show and a friend of mine, did a very good piece where he interviewed an anonymous senior advisor to Marco Rubio who quotedly was quoted as saying, \"We are headed towards massive disclosure.\" Now, he didn't say who this adviser was. Uh, it's not clear whether that statement was authorized by Marco Rubio, but I I have to be honest, I'm not seeing even a whiff, a scaric, a hint of anything coming from the Trump administration on any imminent disclosure. Uh, I don't think they're actively avoiding the issue. The way it's been explained to me, they've just been overwhelmed in the first six to eight months of their administration with dealing with what they've had to deal with. the Middle East, Ukraine, the economy, uh, everything else that the Trump administration's had on its plate, maybe the subject of the biggest story in human history, the greatest secret that mankind has ever known has perhaps been relegated to a lower priority. I have no idea why. If I was Donald Trump or Marco Rubio, the first thing I would do when I got into office was bring in the head of the DIA, the head of the CIA's science and technology department, and I would say, \"You gentlemen will be tried for treason if you don't tell me the truth right now about UAPs. What do we have? What do we know? And why haven't we told the American public about it?\" And if they haven't asked that question, that is a dereliction of their responsibility as officers of executive government that are entrusted by the American people to protect the American Constitution. Because fundamentally at the heart of all of this, Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, every other member of the administration knows that it is an article of the US Constitution that requires that Congress be informed about any expenditure that has been done in its name. And if it's true that there's been billions, perhaps trillions of dollars expended on a legacy UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program, even if a president has issued an executive order or a peed a presidential emergency action directive, that does not excuse the obligation to notify Congress. And if Marco Rubio has not asked the question as acting national security adviser about the legacy program, he bloody well should be because this is the biggest story in human history and the public have a right to know.",

    "question": "Ross, I totally agree and I'm not one to start a fight with Sean Hannity, but I have the transcript in front of me and I just want to point out one thing that I would love to hear you touch on. The very first question of the interview is I want to start this out with a fun question. So, it's just confusing to me. Is the mainstream media starting to take this topic seriously or do they still need to kind of make a joke out of it before they even start discussing it with somebody like Marco Rubio?",
    "answer": "That's what irritates me about this whole subject. Why is it a fun question when, as the age of disclosure demonstrated, people like James Clapper, people like Jay Stratton, um they've got on the record, highly credible, authentic, former senior government officials. I think Jay's got the uh the status of a vice admiral from his civilian position as the head of the UAP task force. This is not some inconsequential role. These are people saying they have in Jay's case direct knowledge of the legacy retrieval and reverse engineering program. Why? I I don't want to buy a fight with Fox or Sean Hannity. I I I actually quite like a lot of the work that Fox has done recently, but why be so flippant about a subject that is so important? Why invite the interviewe Marco Rubio to treat this as a fun question? Why is it a fun question? Why aren't we at the stage now where when the age of disclosure movie makes incredibly clear serious credible people are saying this is a real subject, an authentic subject for investigation? Why invite such flippency? I I I don't understand. I I completely agree with you, Megan. It it makes no sense to me that we would invite an interviewee just to treat this as a joke question. Well, we would love to have him on. So, open invitation for Marco Rubio for you.  Absolutely. I I would love to get him on. And the first question I would ask him is the question that should have been asked, which is, Mr. Secretary of State, Mr. Acting National Security Adviser, you've been in office now for 9 10 months. have you sought and received any information at all on the legacy UAP retrieval reverse engineering program? And if his answer was no, I'd say why not? Why not? And it does make me wonder, I mean, I know a lot of people are getting very cynical and very skeptical about the Trump administration and saying that Trump has wimped it. David Grush um uh you know obviously stuck his neck out recently on Fox News by doing another interview with Brett Bayer in the hope that we could push the Trump administration to do something about the UAP disclosure issue. Other people have spoken more recently. The age of disclosure is an enormous leap forward in terms of adding credibility to the issue. I'm very disappointed. I don't see any evidence at all that the Trump administration at executive level in the White House is doing anything about it. There is there is an ongoing FBI and office of director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard Cash Patel investigation into alleged illegalities. Uh no answers yet on what's coming out of that but uh there is a deafening silence from the White House. Is it as I've been told that the president is too scared to take this issue on? Has Donald Trump wimped it? I'm not calling the president a coward, but is he intimidated by the national security state? Has he been cowed by the deep state? I wonder.  Well, our next question is in that similar vein. This is from Marty and email. Hi, Megan Ross. Appreciate your efforts on this subject. As someone who has been following this fascinating mystery for over 30 plus, I'm starting to feel we are on the brink of an announcement, especially after hearing the comment in the last week from various individuals, David Grash, etc. that efforts are ongoing in the Trump White House. Ross, did you notice within the end credits of Age of Disclosure, Bob Fish was an adviser. Is that significant? Also, when General Neil McCassland mentioned in a leaked email it was the end of the Cold War and we discovered a life form, he might have been referring to the NHI's taken back to the US after the Virginhai UFO crash in 1996. That was not long after the Cold War had ended. Thanks and keep up the good work.  Okay, now I might be wrong on this, but I'm pretty sure cuz I wrote the book about this. I'm pretty sure he didn't say it was the end of the Cold War and we found a life form. I think he said to Tom Dong, and this is the quote, it was the cold war and we found a life form. Um, and that doesn't mean it was at the end of the cold war. I don't think it was the 1996 vaginha crash that he's referring to. Um, I think General Neil Mccasand when he was talking to Tom Dong was probably talking about either Roswell 1947 or Aztec which I think was 194849 I can't remember straight away but um there were as we know alleged multiple retrievals of craft in that period of time in the late 40s early 50s. Um as for Bob Fish Bob's a friend of mine we keep in touch. Um, I don't think it's significant that Bob was an adviser to the age of disclosure. Uh, if I was um Dan Farah and uh J Stratton and uh uh Lu Lzando who were putting all this film together, I would be basically um wanting to draw on the best available sources. And Bob's one of the people who I highlighted in my book knew a great deal. He was um revealed in the Podesta emails that were leaked on Wikileaks. uh to be someone who'd contacted uh Podesta in the White House with information about UAPs. Um but I I you know with the greatest respect to Bob, I don't think his information is any more revelatory than what people like David Grush or J Stratton or others have revealed. Um, suffice to say, I just want to emphasize, I think at the moment, what the Trump administration is doing on UAPs is a big fat nothing. And I worry that we are having the wool pulled over our eyes yet again by the national security state that has been fighting a viciferous war behind the scenes. A lobbying battle with key senators, key chairmen and women of various committees to try and shut down public scrutiny of the UAP issue. There are very brave and courageous politicians who've stuck their necks out and whistleblowers like Dave Grush, Jay Stratton, Lu Lzando who've really pushed hard for the White House to do something about it. But I have to say at the moment I think that we are essentially being blown smoke and mirrors. I I think the administration is trying to ignore it. I don't know whether it's just because it's distracted by other events. I find it very hard to believe that either Marco Rubio or Donald Trump would not have asked the question as soon as they got into power. Frankly, they should have. This is all about the concealment of technologies, of information, of incredible knowledge, sacred knowledge that the public, the human race has a right to know. Unless there's some good reason for the public not to be told about it, I think the president should be considering making an announcement. And uh it would be a grave disappointment if we came to the end of 2025, yet another year where a president allows themselves to be snowed by the national security state.  Okay, Ross, I've got another big headline that we would like your input on. The AP put this out. Malaysia's transport ministry said Wednesday that a private firm will resume a deep sea hunt for Malaysia's airline Flight 370 later this month, more than a decade after the jet vanished without a trace. The search will be carried out by a Texas-based marine robotics firm, Ocean Infiniti, which signed a no find, no fee contract with Malaysia's government in March.  Well, it's good news. It's good news that they're recommencing a search. My worry is that they may [clears throat] be looking in the wrong place. A lot of this is based on I won't go into the incredible detail of it, but essentially it's um new types of data uh investigating um uh electromagnetic uh radiation changes that occur when an aircraft moves through space. U and it means that they allegedly have been able to plot or or harden up the location of MH370 somewhere at the bottom allegedly of the Indian Ocean. Um, I'll be interested to see what they find and if they find. I've done numerous stories on MH370. As viewers would know, I do not subscribe to one conspiracy theory that MH370 was um taken by orbs into some kind of portal which uh is based on a now discredited CGI. And at risk of attracting the viciferousness of several raving nutters on UAP media, I just don't give that theory any currency at all. But I do think that there's something anomalous about the disappearance of MH370. It needs to be resolved. It's one of the biggest aviation mysteries of all time. And um I'm actually in touch with people in Malaysia at the moment. I may be bringing a future story to reality check with some new information from Malaysian researchers, which interestingly enough suggests that MH370 may be in an entirely different location from where the Ocean Infinity people will be searching. So, it'll be very interesting to see what comes out of this search. It's good news, though. Um, I just I hope like hell for the families. I'm in touch with two of the families. Uh people forget that, you know, there are loved ones who've been agonizing for 10 years now to get an answer about this and it causes them real pain when there is um a lot of wacky conspiracy theories pedled about coverups and lies. So the public do deserve answers, especially the the people the families of those who were lost.  Absolutely. Russ, we will go to our next question posted on X. This is from Guy Incognito. Who is the person you trust the most in the government when it comes to being open and honest about the phenomenon and why?  Um, I can't name that person. In fact, there's multiple people in government who are helping me on a confidential basis. Uh, I trust them the most because they have been consistently accurate in terms of what they've told me about the legacy UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program. They are patriots. They think that there are crimes being committed, illegalities being perpetrated because of the continued concealment of this program. They think that there are sections of the Pentagon and the intelligence community and private aerospace who have exceeded lawful authority and are basically acting uh ultravar above the law and they think it's time that they were brought into check. Um uh I can't name those people because to do so would be to jeopardize their confidentiality. But uh suffice to say there are real patriots in the American government, good people who recognize the public's right to know um uh in government. I guess if you would if you were to nominate people in government, does it constitute being in government to be working as a staffer for a um a member of Congress? If that was the case, I'd nominate Dave Grush because David Grush has consistently been, in my opinion, the most accurate and the most truthful reteller of what he knows. And um I just hope that at some stage he gets the vindication he deserves.  The first ever reality check disclosure award goes to Dave Grush. [laughter]",

    "question": "All right, here's an email from Joe. Goodday, Ross. If Brandon has direwolf DNA, wouldn't it be the ultimate evidence, not to mention a suite up yours if he invested in producing a clone? Love your work. Thanks, mate. Joe.",
    "answer": "Okay, just to give our audience some background to this, a few months ago, I did a reality check with Brendan Fugal where we went through some of the revelations from the latest Skinwalker Ranch series. And unlike a lot of people, I actually applaud the science that's being done by the scientists on Skinwalker Ranch. Um, I don't think it's a government disinformation project and I think they are doing good, solid work. And I'm persuaded that Brandon is genuine when he says that he will not allow the people that are doing the production to put in knowingly false information. Um, I'd love to hear from anyone, by the way, who you a lot of people claim to me that there's stuff on skinwalker that's false. I'd love to hear your evidence. Um, the interview I did with Brandon, we talked about the fact that a partial dire wolf, potential dire wolf carcass was found by a riverbank on Skinw Walker Ranch. Why is this significant? Well, firstly, it's significant because there are allegedly no wolves in Utah. Uh, more importantly, the dire wolf died out 10,000 years ago. It's not meant to exist currently. Um, the bits that were found from memory, I do recall it was a jawbone and some other DNA material. It was DNA tested by a company known as Colossal Bioscience. Um, and yes, they are the people who are going on to try to clone a new direwolf, a modern-day direwolf. uh they made a claim I think back in April this year that they had successfully cloned or were about to successfully clone but there's some skepticism about that. What can we say? I don't think we can definitively say that what was recovered at Skinwalker Ranch was a dire wolf. But what they did find was that it was 30 No, it was less than that. It was about, shout at me if I'm wrong, Brandon, but I think it was 10% or 30% DNA of a wolf and the remainder was some species unknown to human science, which strongly suggests it might be dire wolf. And I also remember there was a biologist zoologologist called um I can't remember his first name Woodruff on the Skinwalker Ranch episode who looked at the uh structure of the jawbone of the creature that was found and said it looked like a spitting image of a direwolf. So how did this happen? We don't know. Uh but wouldn't it be cool if they could uh create a direwolf from that DNA? Um let's wait and see. I'd like to see the evidence. Um, certainly one cannot say categorically that it was a direwolf that was recovered, but sure as hell it's intriguing. If it wasn't, what is it? All right, we have another question about Skinwalker Ranch. This is an email from John. Hi Ross. Wouldn't Robert Bigalow be a great person for Congress to have to testify for a future UAP hearing? If I'm not mistaken, Mr. Piccolo has been involved in many aspects of this field and his several year ownership in research at Skinwalker Ranch, the results of which have never been released to the public could provide a lot of information. Thanks and keep up the good work. Uh firstly I I would actually want to underline I think the public owes a deep debt of gratitude to Robert Bigalow for funding the research that was done by his firstly um NID's team the National Institute of Discovery Science of which Edgar Mitchell was a member a board member they did some of the original groundbreaking work into Skinwalker Ranch and my understanding is he was also then involved when the DIA came into the ranch and um did some of their investigations there and uh indeed he may have been present when some of the anomalous phenomena was observed. Um it would be fantastic to get Robert Bigalow to give evidence but I suspect he's operating under the same constraints as a lot of people from that event are. They're under non-disclosure agreements with the Defense Intelligence Agency which funded the OSAP research. That wouldn't block Robert Legalow, by the way, from uh doing um an interview about his National Institute of Discovery Science research. And look, he's done a couple of interviews over the years with George Knapp, our friend and colleague. U and I'd love to get him on reality check. I've tried a few times. Um he uh he's resistant to um intense journalistic scrutiny I suspect because there are a lot of questions curly questions we could ask him about what he's uncovered in his time there and what conclusions he's reached. And don't forget also that Robert Bigalow has also been doing work into consciousness. Um tragically I understand he lost his son. Uh my deepest sympathies there sir. And more importantly, he's taken an enormous amount of effort to fund investigative research into whether human consciousness survives biological death. And I strongly suspect it does. So yes, he'd be a great interview uh along with so many other people who should be called. I'm constantly perplexed at the people who are being called before the congressional inquiries. And I don't know why people like Robert Bigalow are not being called in open public forum and invited to give testimony under oath in a full public hearing. It would be great to hear him testify. He's a great American. He's given an enormous amount, much much more than people realize to public understanding of anomalous phenomena and uh he deserves credit for that.  I agree, Ross. You know, I'm from Las Vegas. So um the Big Lows are an amazing family in  Oh, you're a Las Vegas girl. I thought you were a California girl. I'm I'm everywhere, Ross. I'm I'm everywhere. [laughter] But Vegas, yep, Vegas made, baby. Go night.  Okay, I just want to give a quick plug to the state of the world forum which is being held online hosted by my friend Jim Garrison and myself on the period 14th to the 17th of December this year. Uh what is the state of the world forum? Well, Jim Garrison is an amazing guy. He uh worked for a long time with the New Paradigm Institute with Danny Sheen and he's moved very much more assertively into consciousness studies. Uh Jim wouldn't mind me saying he's a bit of an old hippie and at the end of the cold war he did something quite miraculous between 1995 and 2000 he started up this thing called the state of the world forum where he got Mikall Gorbachef the president of Russia and u secretary of state James Baker um the Indian national congress president Sonia Gandhi the primatologist Jane Goodall noble laureates South African president they becki and an array of people to come and speak at a forum that discussed the state of the world at the end of the cold war and what possibilities there might be for peace in the world in the emerging world order and 20 years on Jim's decided to do it again and I'm very privileged to be involved in this on December the 14th and just to repeat the link it's www.stateoftheorld.forum forum on the 14th to the 17th of December and it's centering around four consequential truths. Accelerating planetary ecological collapse, increasing global and social instability. Are we going to war? Is World War II imminent? Exponential AI. Are the computers going to kill us? And my personal favorite and obsession, cosmic intelligences are present on Earth. It's the first time that disclosure is going to be integrated into a major conference with other world issues and we'll be running multiple forums highlighting the latest for example three atlas with professor Avi lobe UFOs and nukes with Dr. Beatric Villerol, my favorite astrophysicist, and the interface between AI and non-human intelligence with Pipper Mongrren and numerous other speakers speaking about consciousness and how we can achieve world peace. It may be a naive hope in these grim times as the clock ticks ever closer to doomsday midnight, but he is hoping that the speakers including Diane Hennessy Powell, Dr. Ravi lobe Kai Dickens from telep telepathy tapes astrophysicist Dr. Beatatric Villerol Dr. Rupert Shel Sheldrake the biologist and consciousness researcher former US National Science Foundation program director Dr. Anna Brady Estz experiencer author Chris Bledzo economist technologist Dr. Pipper Mongram and former UAP task force collaborator Sarah Gam. He is hoping we can arrive at a solution for world peace and UFOs AI NHI.

    "question": "It's a News Nation exclusive. There's obviously something going on in Arizona along the border areas hunting UFOs. Now, this ex Border Patrol agent is going public for the first time with neverbeforeseen video. What they are, I I have no idea. Examine the evidence. There's an old straight ahead of me. And search for secrets. It's over the border of the United States. It's a genuine mystery. Hunting UFOs, the desert sky mystery. Saturday at 8, 7 central, only on News [Music] Nation. Good day and welcome back to Reality Check Q&A. I'm your host, Ross Kulart, and it's that time of the week where you, the viewer, get to ask me the questions. And what a couple of weeks it's been. It's been a very busy time in the study of the phenomenon. Hello, Megan. Here to help us ask those questions is my colleague in crime, Megan Orata. How are you, Megan? Ross, I am fantastic. We have some great news to share right off the top. You have a new special. You've been working really hard on this and it is airing this Saturday at NewsNation. Hunting UFOs: The Desert Sky Mystery with Ross Colt. Saturday, 8:00 p.m. 7 central. Let's play a little clip from that special. We're going into the field to investigate allegations that the US may well have recovered nonhuman technology. And to that effect, I'm on my way to meet my very first source. His name is Bob Thompson, and he's never spoken on camera before. Thompson's an Army veteran who spent 14 years with US Customs and Border Protection. Eventually, he became part of the Arizona Air Coordination Center, which monitors the airspace along the US border. It was always a challenging job. And then he says it got weird. There's a lot of stuff that's been cited out here. Everybody come go ahead and grab yourself a chair. So, it's coming up to midnight and Melinda's been seeing increased activity. Anomalous objects doing extraordinary things and often escorted by dozens of military helicopters. So, we're hoping we might see some tonight. There's two together right there coming up. Yeah, there's a military chopper coming up. Oh, wow. So, this is what you're talking about. There's a military chopper in proximity to those objects. So there's these two here and there's these two right here and he came up right behind them. So if nothing else, Belinda, I'm satisfied that I'm seeing a lot of choppers hovering and moving with purpose around other objects which are demonstrably anomalous. So I'm very excited to bring you this story. Um, obviously we all know there's been interesting phenomena seen for years all over Arizona. And one of the things we did as part of this investigation was go to the Mexican border and catch up with our correspondent there, Alli Bradley, to see if we could plausibly explain what was being seen in this guy, especially by uh Customs and Border Protection, Homeland Security surveillance to see if it could be explained perhaps as cartel organized crime operations. As you'll see, we were able to rule that out. And the intriguing thing is our research led us to a location very near Sedona. And it raises the very serious question, is what Melinda Leslie and many other people are seeing in and around the town of Sedona something that is part of a broader coverup? Is there a deep underground military facility near Sedona? That's what we've been investigating and it's been absolutely fascinating getting to the bottom of this mystery. I think there is something out there. I do believe that the evidence is overwhelming that there are apparent tests going on involving government US military helicopters uh accompanying some kind of craft. And I for the life of me can't believe how obvious it is that it's sitting there in plain sight right there near the the counterculture town of Sedona. I guess though when when you talk to people in the intelligence community they often say the best way to hide things is to hide them in plain sight. And boy that's what they're doing. All right Ross. And there will be a live after show after the special airs on 87 central on Saturday. Um we'll also be posting the full special on YouTube. and everybody you see in this special, we will air their full long form interview with Ross on Reality Check as well. Looking forward to that and looking forward to answering any of your questions in the live after show chat. Our first question is from Allison. This came over with email. I recently took a trip to New Mexico and had a UFO guided viewing where we saw orbs zipping about at high, even a few at lower altitude. In the middle of the show, two orbs went off by themselves and began flashing a very fast sequence of multicolored lights. I asked our guide about it, and he said he's seen it before, but doesn't know what it means. They moved way too fast to be drones. Is anyone trying to decipher these signals if they are that? That's a really good question. They are um I've spoken to people who've recorded those flashing lights. They've recorded the color of course and obviously the frequency and the duration of the lights. At the moment, nobody's telling me they've been able to decipher any kind of message from them. Um, it is intriguing though, isn't it? I mean, the fact that you can go out into the New Mexico desert as we have done for this week's special in Arizona, and you can see anomalous objects all the time. I mean, they're right there under our noses and they are they're displaying these weird phenomena and I think it deserves to be studied and uh yes, I agree it should be investigated. I just don't know any more about whether or not there is in any intended messaging behind the frequency of the lights involved. Okay. And this question is about our episode from last week. Greetings. So Ross, we are indeed thankful to all your sources, but do you and your cohorts get the feeling that Jacques Valet is either being very choice with his words or is possibly afraid of sharing more? Because to me, it seems he knows a lot lot more than he's letting on. Kudos on the work, Reek. Well, Jacques does know a lot more. I mean, he's quite open about that. And um one of the issues of course with anybody who worked on um uh NIDS and a lot of the Bob Bigalow work is because they were at different times under contract with the Defense Intelligence Agency, they were constrained by national security uh undertakings and uh you know I I tried exploring with Jacqu as you saw in the interview the fact that there was a clear intent uh with the Bass project that came out of um OSAP, the uh DIA funded investigation at Skinwalker Ranch. There was clearly an intent at one stage, and I've heard this from multiple people, for some kind of technology, NHI technology, possibly a craft, I'm told it was a craft, to be handed over by Loheed Martin to Bigalow Aerospace. And that's why when the New York Times wrote its story in 2017, Leslie Kaine and Ralph Blumenal talked about the fact that there was a very highly secure warehouse being built for the purposes of storing nonhuman intelligence technology and materials. And nothing came of that. And the reason we now know that nothing came of that is because the um allegedly the CIA intervened to stop the transfer of that technology because they were worried that it would leak. And so yeah, I mean I think it's really interesting with Jacques and a lot of these people that have worked with Bob Bigalow and the NIDS and then the Bass and the OAP and the ATIP investigations because the simple fact is that they have they've they've crossed over at times into that dark world. They've dealt with people like James Latsky who was the um defense official that they were liazing with and obviously at different times they have to hold back on what they know and it's one of the great frustrations but at the same time I I sense from the UAP community u an idea that it's my obligation as a journalist and it's Jacques's obligation as a commentator just to word vomit out everything they know uh even if it jeopardizes or or is perhaps reckless with important national security secrets. I know this may sound old-fashioned, but I do I re reiterate this often. Um I do think it's important that journalists respect national security issues and secrets and and there are things that are done in the best interests of the United States and five eyes allows like my country Australia that are worthy of protection. And maybe that's one of the reasons why Jacques has to sort of tow that difficult line. I thought he was quite forthcoming in his interview. I would have loved to have got a lot more from him. It was a privilege to be able to speak to a man who is frankly the elder statesman of eupfology. Absolutely. Um our next question. Hi Ross. As a fellow Aussie, I'm very interested in any information you have about Pine Gap and its activities around UAP. Are we likely to get any whistleblowers on this facility? Also, is there any movement to press our government for UAP disclosure? Really appreciate your continued investigations into this subject. Many thanks, MJM. Okay, for those people who don't know what Pinegap is, Pinegap is the most important US military base outside the continental United States and it is located slap bang in the middle of Australia near Uluru otherwise known as Air's Rock near Ellis Springs right in the middle of central Australia. And the reason it's there, it was built originally in the 1960s as a station for receiving the downlink signals from the DSP satellites, the Defense Support Program satellites that were recording um ballistic missile flashes on the surface of the planet. They were intended as like early warning uh satellites to to signal whether a potential foreign adversary was launching a missile. and they've been an important part of the US strategic nuclear deterrence for the last 60 years. What has happened at Pine Gap is it's become an absolutely essential arm of the Five Eyes Alliance. Um, I've seen uh serendipitously uh I was taken through a place called Garden Island in central Sydney and I was uh at one stage escorted by a very senior minister in our government and taken somewhere where I probably shouldn't and shown the feeds coming into a naval facility in central Sydney which are also the feeds I understand that go through Pine Gap and they were literally satellite feeds from drones and from satellites in real time coming in through Australia on their way to America and they were mindblowing. Uh it was quite extraordinary to see the level to which Australia as an ally of the United States is plugged in to the intelligence feed from America and that for some reason has attracted the interest of the phenomenon. Yes, there are many recorded incidents that I write about in my book, In Plain Sight, uh, an investigation into UFOs and impossible science. And, um, you will find in there my recognition of the fact that there have been multiple incidents reported by both American personnel and Australian personnel. This is a a joint facility uh, where in some cases orbs have been seen. I spoke to one person who described seeing an orb at one stage tracking the fence line around the facility and then as they watched it literally went through the wall of the building and then there were um CCTV feeds of the object whatever it was passing through other walls and going into allegedly the more sensitive parts of that facility. And I'm told this happens quite a lot. I've spoken to Aboriginal communities that live very close by on the other side of the so-called McDonald range and they tell me they see weird stuff in the sky all the time and that Pine Gap does seem to be a bit of a hot bed of UAP activity. And for those of you who love a good conspiracy theory, I'm sure there will be many people who remind me of this. Um, the remote viewers that were operated by the CIA during the 70s and the 80s, they picked a location called Mount Zeal, which is only about 120 kilometers west of Pine Gap, as being the alleged location for a base for nonhuman intelligences. I've never been able to confirm this. Um, I've had a look at the area. The bottom line is you don't see anything other than scrub and dirty outback desert. Um uh but I am intrigued by Pine Gap. It is the most secret facility in Australia. Uh government very rarely talks about it and yes it is a hot bed of UAP activity. And to answer the broader question from the the person asking the question, um Australia really has its head in the sand on the UAP issue. The government officially has no interest in UAPs. It declaims any knowledge at all in monitoring them. And it's going to be very interesting to see because we know that Dr. John Klosski, the current ARO boss in evidence last year, he acknowledged that he would be reaching out to Five Eyes Partners to ask them to start collecting UAP evidence. And it's going to be very interesting to see whether the Australian government acesed to that request. At the moment, from multiple questions that have been asked in our parliament by different people, it's quite clear that we're still in an era of denial and ridicule and taboo directed towards the UAP subjects, even though Australia has its own fair share of UAP sightings. Okay, Ross, we have another question on a different incident. Hi, Ross, thanks for your continued efforts on this subject. What are your thoughts on the Welsh Pinchk incident? Kind regards, Rich. Oh, this is actually a very interesting story. The Penturk case. Uh there's a woman called Kez Clark who lives in the little town of Penturk in Wales H in the United Kingdom and she reported uh gosh, I've forgotten how many years ago it is now, but it's within the last 5 or 10 years. She reported the most extraordinary sighting of an anomalous craft that was clearly uh not of local manufacturer. gigantic object uh hovering over her field adjacent to her home. It was allegedly witnessed by a neighbor of hers and then as she watched it was being chased by military aircraft, both British and apparently US military aircraft. And it's interesting. I preface everything here by saying I have never been able to go to Penturk to investigate this case and I would dearly love to. Uh, I've just never been able to get the money to travel to the United Kingdom because it costs an enormous amount of money to travel to these parts of the world to go and do this kind of investigation. And I do think the Pentk is worth a look. There are people in the Welsh UAP community who think that the Pentk is all nonsense and that it's all been exaggerated and that it's not true and that we shouldn't take it seriously. I am not so sure. I do think it is worthy of further intense investigation that examination. I've spoken to Cas Clark and I've also spoken to other witnesses who are a little more reticent about going public. One of the things, for example, that I found especially interesting about the Penturk case, and I've been able to confirm this for myself, is that where the object, let's be neutral about it, allegedly crashed in the forest, it is the case that the British Forest Service came in and excised every tree in that area on the speurious grounds that they were getting rid of some kind of fungus in that forest. And what's interesting is um Cass and one of her colleagues went in and recorded what looked like some kind of burn mark on the tree. There is also evidence to suggest that ordinance was fired, perhaps even surfaceto-air or um air airto-air missiles that were used to engage this object. And what's beyond any shadow of a doubt is that there was a substantial covert military operation in the forest around Penturk in the weeks after this incident. So there's something going on and I do think it's worthy of further investigation. There's a great YouTube video about it called I think the Penturk incident that's on YouTube. It has me intrigued. I've spoken to Cass about it. She's adamant that what she saw was real and she'd love to have it properly investigated. One of the big things that confounds these kind of stories is just getting the resources to be able to investigate them. And it's a dream of mine to go back there and to do a proper dig. What I have no doubt about is that the United Kingdom has been involved in UAP craft retrievalss with the United States and there is an increment of the British special forces that are involved in doing these operations and I suspect Penturk might be one. Okay, thank you. Uh our next question, Megan and Ross, thank you for dedicating your time to these Q&A episodes. If we consider the broader field of psionics to include the possibility of communication with or even a direct address from NHI, it seems that such phenomena may manifest as what has been termed channeling. Ross, do any of your sources slashcontext take any so-called chneled material seriously in their understanding of the phenomenon at large? Thanks, Alan W. Yes, they do. I mean, I talk all the time to people who claim to be in contact with a non-human intelligence, and yes, they claim to receive messages. Um, I I've lost count of the number of people who who claim to receive uh some kind of message. More often than not, it's a kind, benevolent message. Sometimes it's very specific. Um, I I just don't know. I mean, how do how does one verify these things? Often they're telepathic. Um, so somebody is claiming that they're receiving a message in their head. It's almost impossible scientifically to verify or measure or assess that. Um, but yes, there are many people who say that they are channeling messages from the phenomenon. And there are people that I'm talking to who contact me frequently who claim that the phenomenon is talking about ramping up its overt presence on the planet and that the drones that were operating over the east coast of the United States and other parts of the US and different parts of the world with the beginning of a bigger show. I'm yet to see that evidence surface. And one of the things I often do is I go back and have a look at what people who report channeling tell me and see whether any of that has actually come to pass. And I have to say at the moment I'd probably give it about a one out of 10 in terms of veracity and accuracy. Okay, Ross, thank you. That was the last one for today. Oh, that was easy. Thank you so much, Megan. Well, I hope people enjoy this special uh uh in uh Arizona and um I I hope if anybody has any information by the way about deep underground military bunkers, military facilities that might be being used for the storage and research into the uh phenomenon of NHI technology. As incredible as that may sound, I am very very interested in hearing from you. Well, they can send that along with their questions to reality check atnewsnationow.com. No worries.

    "question": "Okay, we will go to an email from Zayn. Thank you for all the content and hard work you two do on a daily basis. My question is, if the US was to get into a military conflict with Russia or China, do you think we would see these exotic or advanced crafts in battle? Is there any external conflict conflict important enough to win that we would see these be used? Any insight you can provide would be appreciated. That's a very interesting question. I mean, one of the explanations I've been offered, I suspect some of it's speculative from people purporting to know what's going on inside the legacy retrieval and reverse engineering program. They offer the explanation that one of the reasons for the secrecy is that we want to ensure that we when I say we I mean America the western alliance the five eyes alliance has dominance in terms of any potential conflict with a foreign adversary. The concern from the sources I've spoken to in the program with direct knowledge they assert of what the US has and what the US has done with that technology is that because of the excessive secrecy surrounding the program we have been overtaken by China in particular. But the concern and as you would have heard on reality check a few weeks ago, I've talked about the Russians as well, the Yemen mountain complex where there are a lot of developments of super weapons that are happening amongst the Russian scientific community. The concern is that Russia and China have been able to develop an advance over what the US has done with these technologies and we just won't know. Frankly, I find it very sad that if there is retrieved non-human technology, it's potentially being held back from the public and kept secret so that we can win the next war with it. What would that say to any potential non-human intelligence that's having a look at us from afar, wondering if we are perhaps worthy of membership of some greater community of non-human intelligences? I I suspect they'd take a pretty dim view. I mean, we have to forget our warlike tech, warlike tendencies and maybe find different ways of resolving conflict. Uh, but yeah, I mean, I do think that the United States has developed weapons. I've talked openly about scalar weapons and pulse beam technology before, plasma beam technology. I do believe that those weapons are in development, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if we were holding them back in reserve for potential conflicts. But I think what we have to be very careful about is whether the Russians and the Chinese have developed something similar or better.",

    "question": "Okay. UAP Jedi on X. Hi Megan. In the next Q&A, could you ask Ross about NASA becoming a national intelligence and security agency? And could it mean an increase in its budget through undisclosed black budget funding? Also, what does it mean for any potential disclosure of precursors of intelligent life being found on exoplanets? Look, I spoke to somebody uh in NASA about this and they told me they thought it had more to do with the Trump administration's intention to impose massive bud budget cuts on the space agency and that they're trying to avoid a fight with the labor unions by categorizing NASA as an intelligence agency, which means that the labor unions can't have the influence and power that they would if it was just a normal civilian agency. I mean, let's be realistic. NASA has operated for all of its life as a quasi military intelligence agency. Most of the programs that are being launched by NASA uh through mainly SpaceX because they can't fly a rocket themselves most of the time is um uh intelligence classified material spy satellites and things like that. So there's already been a lot of intelligence work by NASA and I'm always reminded of the fact that my friend the spaceman who was a close friend of uh astronaut Edgar Mitchell on Apollo 14, Edgar Mitchell told him that the Apollo astronauts were aware of nonhuman intelligences following each moon mission out from Earth, following them and watching them while they were on the moon and then following them back to Earth. And when he was asked by the spaceman why he'd never spoken publicly about it, Edgar used the one word, treason. And that's a story I tell in my book. And it's interesting because it shows just how much of a quasi military agency NASA is. And people need to look, I mean, honestly, the origins of NASA are very much rooted in the um Nazi spies, sorry, the Nazi Nazi military that were brought out during Operation Paperclip after the Second World War. Much of NASA is rooted in intelligence and defense. So, it's no huge surprise to me. I suspect it's got a lot to do with the decision to try and cut NASA funding. Um, I do think uh NASA's origins are very much rooted in the defense and intelligence community. And it doesn't surprise me at all that it's being categorized as an intelligence agency, but I think that's got a lot to do with the Trump administration's intentions to take on the labor unions and impose massive budget cuts on the space agency. And if they are imposing budget cuts on the space agency, why would a US government administration decide that the space agency of the United States was largely surplus to requirements? Go figure. Interesting, isn't it?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. We have an email from Mark that came in. In a video on YouTube, it is claimed that the SkyWatcher program actually got a UAP to land in the presence of NASA. Have you heard anything about this from any of your sources? There didn't seem to be anything about it on SkyWatcher website last time I checked. This is something you may want to ask the people at SkyWatcher about and maybe even offer to do an interview with them. Hopefully, this would be something that they can agree to and not be restricted by any NDAs.  Oh, I couldn't agree more. Look, I I have heard about an incident uh which I have not been told about officially. Um, I I'm aware that two uh psionic operators went off on their own. They weren't wearing cameras. They weren't carrying any kind of video equipment. And in the course of an encounter, a summoning that they were trying to do privately. An object, a craft did apparently land in front of them. Um, I'm assuming that this story is being held back by Alex Clous and Skywatcher for what I'm told we can expect to be the next installment of their videos that they're producing uh, which they often put up online. They've put two two or three previous videos up online and um, this next one's meant to be on psionics. Uh, so I've invited Alex Clous Skywatcher multiple times. We have an open invitation to Skywatcher to appear. I do think in the interests of public disclosure, it would be great to get somebody from Skywatcher on at some stage to talk about what they're up to because it's one of the things we get questions about more than most. People are really interested and excited and happy to see that there is an organization that's properly funded that's doing good work investigating UAPs and they have including to me made multiple promises about being transparent and open and I am like everyone else getting frustrated with the degree of secrecy surrounding the SkyWatcher operation. I can only assume it's because they want to make their own films and do their own media. And we welcome that. But it would be great at some stage to get Alex Clos, Jake, anybody else from Skywatcher who's interested in coming on and talking to actually talk about what they've been doing, especially with the psionics. And yes, we've heard about this incident involving an alleged landing. Carl Crusher mentioned it to me when we were doing the work with Magic Mike Batista a few weeks ago. and uh we really haven't heard any more. Love to hear more.",

    "question": "Okay, Ruby on X, they posted a flyer um and tagged us in it. Rumors and public advertisements are stating that a paranormal fair being held in France will be revealing one of the alien Roswell bodies in a glass case under high surveillance. They're asking us, are the French about to unveil one of these bodies, or is this all rubbish? I think we can safely say pretty damn quickly this is a steaming pile of I don't know what the word is for BS in French but uh uh I I I think we should be skeptical. Um uh I have not heard of any claim at all that a Roswell body has been released to anyone in France least of all to a paranormal fear. Uh, I can imagine that the biologics, as David Grush referred to them from Roswell, are locked up pretty damn tightly in a vault somewhere, and I'm told it's somewhere in Virginia.

    "question": "Okay, the bugosphere again another subject that we get a lot of queries about. Yes, I have taken a very very close interest in the work of a friend of mine, Patrick Jackson, who we will hopefully be bringing on the program sometime soon. uh who's talked about what he thinks is a sphere network that operates around this planet. Um the Booga sphere is a metallic orb that was reportedly filmed hovering and maneuvering over a place called Booger in Colombia in early March this year. The witnesses described it as a shiny engraved sphere about the size of a bowling ball. It weighed initially about four or five pounds, but allegedly the weight has somehow miraculously been able to vary at times. Um there's anomalous weight fluctuations is the term, including um uh allegedly up to 8 kg in changes without visible mass alteration. There are glyphs, internal layered structures visible via X-ray, claims of emitted low frequency signals, claims that it's been responding to stimuli like Sanskrit chants. It was recovered by locals and it's been analyzed by the prominent uh and controversial Mexican eupfologist Yami Masan and Dr. Steven Greer who have promoted it as potential nonhuman technology. Now there are some interesting aspects of this object. The videos and scans do appear to show fiber optic like threads and resin dots inside which has fueled speculation of some kind of ancient perhaps non-human origin. Is it a hoax? Look, we just don't know. And frankly, I don't think we can say it's either a hoax or authentic right now without rigorous completely independent testing. Um, yes, the X-ray scans do reveal complex internal geometry, three layered spheres, fiber optic alleged threads. Um, there's alleged anomalies with the weight, electromagnetic emissions. Um there's the glyphs apparently have been analyzed by AI and they're supposedly showing patterns linked to mech symbols. Um there is a criticism which is that the promoters that it is an authentic object are at the moment not handing it over to an independent laboratory. And frankly who can blame them when we know what happened to previous spheres in the in the 1970s. There was a family in Florida that found one of these metallic spheres. They handed it over to the US Air Force and it came back inert. it had changed from what they personally witnessed and filmed. So, what are the arguments for a potential hoax? We have to be upfront and say that Hami Masan, albeit an extremely well-intentioned and I think very decent man, he's been accused of mistaken beliefs before. Uh there was the um alien mummies incident involving Steven Greer, the Atakama object which I think um professor uh Gary Nolan definitively proved to be of human origin even though there are many in UAPology who take issue with that. Um the uh the glyphs, well I mean anybody could get a metal ball and engrave it on a metal ball and make it look mysterious. Um there's no independent verification. I mean it would be great to you know to see something other than unacredited labs making these claims. My my issue with the um the documents that they've cited from these labs is that they've got typos. There's been misidentifications. It's It's really weird. Um, so you need third party lab access. Uh, what else did I think? Oh, yeah. These resin specs. I mean, it's impossible to know. I mean, are they contaminations? We just don't know. I don't know enough about how the resin was obtained, whether there's a possibility of crosscontamination. Did the resin get stuck to the object when it landed on the ground? I know a lot of people will say that what it does the resin is it shows that the object this is the whole point is that it has a calibrated age of 10,510 years before Christian era um which is 12,560 years ago. Um I know Metabunks had a go at it as well. Stephen sorry what's his name? The seagull guy. Mick West. Um, bottom line is I just don't know. I mean, I I'd just like to see it rigorously independently tested. There have been claims before like this which have been disproven. Um, I think we should enter into it extremely skeptically. Uh, but yeah, I'd like to go and have a look at it. And uh, Yummy Man has invited me to come to Mexico and when we have News Nation's bloated travel budget, we will zoom down there on our private jet and we'll go and have a look. Absolutely, Ross. I'm going to give you one more for today. This is from George. Has Ross ever read the law of one, also known as the RA contact material? I asked this because the entity known as RA makes very specific claims that Ross may be able to verify. For example, RA states that US had ARVs in the 80s.",
    "answer": "Okay. The law of one rah. This is a um a very extensive series of alleged chneled messages. Um I've I've looked at this 106 conversations called sessions between I think he was a physicist called Don Elkins. Uh he was a professor of physics and a UFO investigator. And he said that he was talking to somebody called RA. They were a supposed sixth density social memory complex that formed on Venus about 2.6 billion years ago. Humble messages of the law of one. And that they'd previously tried to spread this message in Egypt with mixed results. So, we're meant to assume that the references to the sun god Rah in Egypt are in some way connected to the law of Rah. Um, frankly, what are we meant to make of this? I I would like to see I know that the uh the correspondent suggests that there's been previous predictions that the US has got alien reproduction vehicles. It would be great in any of those channeling sessions if there was just one specific detail that gave us enough detail to be able to say definitively, \"Wow.\" That is a piece of corroborative evidence that allows us to say definitively, \"Wow, this person that spoke to this professor did say something all those years ago which can now be definitively corroborated.\" But in my limited reading of the law of one, I haven't seen anything that is with sufficient specificity to say, \"Well, yeah, that's really so specific. It rocks my boat.\" It it's not unusual that somebody might channel the idea to somebody in North America in the last few decades and suggest that um the United States has been able to reproduce non-human technology. that's been the subject of speculation for many many decades. Um I I also think we should be skeptical of anybody that purports to be able to channel something unless there's independent corroboration. Um skepticism frankly is always the best option. skepticism is good and I I just don't think at the moment there's enough to be able to say definitively yes there is something to the law of one or indeed anything to any of these claims that are made about channeling. I get so many people sending me claims that they've had chneled messages from non-human intelligences and they all contradict each other. So they can't all be right but is any one of them right? That's the issue.  All right, thank you so much. That is all for today. I'm not letting you go so quickly, Megan. So many of our viewers have asked me to ask you where you stand on UAPs.  It's time, Megan. We're not going to let you,",

    "question": "[Music] Good day and welcome to this week's episode of Reality Check Q&A. That opportunity in the week where you get the chance to ask me the curly questions. And to help me do that is Megan Orda. Welcome Megan. Nice to see you here. Ross, great to see you today. Just like last week, I should actually sort of say before we start that I have been as sick as a dog, Megan. I've had CO. So, if I'm a little slow off the mark today, I plead I plead the excuse. I've got a doctor's certificate to prove it. I have been very ill. So, uh please be kind to me. Yes. Well, Ross, we are all glad that you're feeling better. Um we will probably not take it easy on you um like normal. Um, but we do need to start this week just like last week with breaking news. So, get this. Policy director for the White House Office of Science Technology. His name is Michael Katzios. He said today about US technology. I'm going to quote him here. Our technologies permit us to manipulate time and space. They leave distance annihilated. Let's listen into a bit of his sound. Our technologies permit us to manipulate time and space. They leave distance annihilated, cause things to grow and improve productivity. Okay, Megan. Well, I would love to think that Michael Katzios, the White House science and technology advisor, a former under secretary of defense, a former chief technology officer for the United States. I would love to be able to say with absolute bold assertion that he's talking there about retrieved alien technology and he's about to blow all in a big disclosure moment. But wiser heads are suggesting to me that one should view his comments metaphorically that essentially he's firstly not a trained engineer or scientist. He's somebody who comes from a policy background. uh he is the former US chief technology officer from two 2019 to 2021. uh he's also briefly acted as the under secretary of defense for re research and engineering from 2020 to 2021 and he was also intriguingly chief of staff to Peter Teal at Palanteer and he's had a huge role in AI but a lot of people are emphasizing to me that his speech was essentially and I think it was a great speech his speech was talking about how weird it is that the US has really not made any significant technological advances equivalent to what we'd made up to that period in the ' 50s60s and 70s in the same way in the past 50 years and he talks I think it's worth including some of his earlier comments a gap exists lies between our moment and the speed of transformation America experienced midentury progress has slowed yes large language models astonishes rockets still turn our eyes upwards and satellites envelop the globe. But as we look forward to America's 250th birthday celebration next year, our progress today pales in comparison to the huge leaps of the 20th century. Consider the country of 50 years ago. And he's right. And you know, the interesting thing is people inside the legacy program, they tell me that this is why they're frustrated. They say that this is why they want the United States government to tell the truth about the advanced technology that it has because they believe that there have been advances made. But if you look at even science and technology developments in aviation and space tech, we're still using space rockets that were essentially designed by the Nazis in the 1940s. I mean really we haven't come very far at all on the official public record and so I guess I do think in all likelihood Michael Katzios was speaking metaphorically and even if he was alluding in some way to some secret program that he's been briefed into he's obviously got the out he can say look I was speaking metaphorically I was speaking about even when I'm talking about the ability to manipulate space and time. Maybe he's talking about the extraordinary developments in hypersonics technology or quantum AI. I mean, there's any number of reasons that he could give to metaphorically explain what he was saying. So, I think we've killed that one for the moment at least, Megan. But believe me, everyone, I am chasing Michael Katsios for the opportunity to do an interview with him because I do think he would be a very good interview. Ross, we definitely agree. U we will go to the next question. Speaking of technology, we've got James Kirk. Dear Mr. Colart, I applaud your statement that there may be many alien civilizations visiting our planet. Do you think a technology can be developed to mimic the human brain to summon certain types of UAPs or UFOs? And could this technology be quantbased? So, do I think a technology exists or do do I think a technology could be created that could mimic the human brain to summon UAPs? Is that the basic question? Correct. Well, I I think the point of Skywatcher is that there's already a technology they claim that exists that can do that and that's psionic technology. So, we don't need to develop a technology. It already exists. James T. Kirk. Um I think um uh I've seen psionic technology developed uh shown and demonstrated and I I think it's real. Um I I uh I I can't explain it. I don't know how it works. There's also the dog whistle which is the um electro mechanical signaling device. And obviously Skywatch is being slightly koi and revealing the full extent of what it knows about the dog whistle. I can't blame them because frankly, let's point this out to people. If it is the case that this device can summon UAPs, you really don't want to summon a UAP unless you know what you're doing. Um, so yeah, I mean, I don't think we need to replicate the human brain in order to be able to do this. I think the human brain's already capable of doing it. Okay, Ros, I'm going to skip ahead to a couple questions to kind of play off what you just said. This is from at the GFN PC. Do you think it's safe that we summon them? What exactly is the message the NIH are receiving during the dog whistle? What if they get upset that they keep getting called? Those are all incredibly good questions. And uh if people watch my interview with Jake Barber and Matthew Pines that we did about two weeks ago on reality check, we actually went into a lot of this where you know we explored with Jake what they do. And ultimately one of the things that I think Jake explained which I'd love to hear more about by the way is that they have an oath that everybody swears on the area on the range before they actually do the summoning. They've also vowed at SkyWatcher not to act offensively against NHI, which I think is absolutely crucial. That's a distinction from what I understand the United States government has been doing in collusion with private aerospace. As shocking as it may sound, the United States has secretly, the military has secretly been using high pulse microwave weapons to down UAP craft that it has been summoning using both psionics and the electromechanical dog whistle. I I really think that's outrageous. Wouldn't it be terrible if our first engagement with a nonhuman intelligence was that humans acted offensively against a highly advanced intelligence? And what does it say about the benevolence of that intelligence that even though it's had that done to it, it hasn't wiped us out? Absolutely. Let's go to our next question. This is from uh email. Kimberly Mackey sent this in. Hi Ross. I would love to hear your thoughts on why private citizens with funding for places like Skywatcher and Skinwatcher Ranch have such great success yet taxpayer funded places like NASA and other groups which receive grants to research space are not achieving the same success. Could they be keeping the public in the dark for more funding? Or could it be that these phenomenon are not from space but from here within Earth? Okay, there's two kind of questions in there. Firstly, I'll deal with the latter one first. I think there is a very high likelihood that part of the phenomenon that we're talking about is intraterrestrial, that it's from this planet, perhaps in another dimension in this planet or perhaps deep underwater on this planet and out of sight of humanity. Uh, but I think there is a possibility that at least some of what explains the phenomenon is here with us in some way. Uh, what was the first part of the question? Forgive me, I'm still a bit dirty. Absolutely. Why do places like Skywatcher and Skinwatcher Ranch who have private citizens with private funding, why are they having so much success when places like NASA that are that are funded by taxpayers, they're not really seeing as much success? Okay, I think NASA knows a hell of a lot more about the phenomenon than it prefers to let on. Now, it's very complicated this because I am not saying that the senior leadership at NASA knows everything. I've been in the weird situation where without naming him I've been able to speak to an extremely senior person who served in a very senior p role at NASA and they have assured me convincingly that they were not read in to any legacy UAP retrieval and reverse engineering program. But I'm aware from my own sources. I even know the name of the person in NASA. And I've passed that name on to the person who I was talking to who is allegedly the gatekeeper inside NASA who controls all legacy program issues inside NASA. The program is very clever. They don't use necessarily the top people to run their operation. They do keep a very close eye on nominally civilian governmental organizations like NASA to make sure they don't stumble across something that might blow their cover. And so they have people inserted like moles if you like to keep an eye on what's going on. And I am persuaded that yes, NASA has been sanitizing photographs and video to disguise in some cases things that have been recorded. I take particularly close interest, for example, as some of the space shuttle missions, notably STS48 that I'm doing an awful lot of work on at the moment. For those who don't know STS48, go to YouTube, put that in and have a look at it. It shows an object clearly appearing to avoid a flash of light from the planet and then zooming off into outer space after the flash of light. Now, certain NASA debunker skeptics, self-styled NASA spokespeople who aren't really, have asserted that those are space debris of some kind, perhaps ice particles from the thrusters on the shuttle. That does not bear out. And uh I've had good cause from recent sources that have got in touch with me to develop the view that there has been obscuring of photographs and videos inside NASA. But to suggest that this has been coordinated at a very high level inside NASA is another thing entirely. The legacy program is much much cleverer than that. And I do believe that there are individuals in NASA who are aware of retrieved non-human technology. And indeed, I've spoken to some of them who are willing to tell me off the record that they do believe there is a cover up. But I think the issue with NASA is quite complicated because I think it's a well-meaning institution that has been egregiously misled. All right, Ross, we will go to the next question. And this is from Carol Long. I know you love this topic. What happened to the drone sightings in the USA and other parts of the world. The news on these seems to have stopped suddenly. Okay. Well, if you believe the official narrative, the official narrative is that the drones all went away and that we were all deluding ourselves in a hyperbolic misunderstanding and that these were largely um normal flights flying in and around New Jersey and that people were misidentifying normal regular aircraft and drones for objects that were anomalous. Now, our NewsNation correspondent Rich McHugh, and you might want to use a segment from what Rich showed us, he was out at sea with uh I think a section of the US uh Coast Guard. Actually, no, he wasn't out at sea. He was on the beach after they got back in from being on the ocean. and he recorded an extraordinary interview, Megan, with people who had been out on the ocean and seen anomalous objects, injubitably anomalous objects. Moreover, I know because I spoke to them at the time that they were doing it that the Skywatcher team, including Jake Barber, were deployed over the Pikatini Arsenal in New Jersey in December. And it's interesting because Jake Barber has now confirmed on the record what he'd confirmed to me off the record, which is that they did see anomalous objects over the Pikatini Arsenal, which is one of the most sensitive weapons installations in that part of the United States. It's located in northern New Jersey. So, I've actually promised some Irish friends of mine that I would use the word bollocks. bollocks. And I'm going to say bollocks to the whole claim that these drones can be prosaically explained. It's a cover up. Somebody in the US government is lying. And frankly, there's not a lot we can do about it because the White House position of course is that these are FAA authorized drones. And that frankly does not survive scrutiny. It's complete bollocks. There is no basis at all to the suggestion that the FAA authorized these these supposed incursions by authorized research drones. They've never provided any evidence to substantiate that there were authorized research flights. And I suspect that the recent announcement that the FAA would be conducting research drone flights over New Jersey is an expost facto attempt to justify the line that they've perpetuated for the last few months. I can tell you that the people of New Jersey and their political representatives aren't buying it. I've also spoken more recently to certain people in the police force there who tell me they're not buying it either. They know what they saw. Okay, Rosson, I will make sure to add in Rich Mchuan NewsNation's video that you were referring to and I can link to some of those um episodes that we did below for people as well if they want to check them out. Um we will move on to newbotany. Back in the 40s until recently, most of the UAP scene could be described as flying saucers. Now we have all kinds of peculiar devices that have been documented by SkyWatcher, none of which are consistent with the original saucer description. Why is that? I don't think Skywatch is in a position yet to be able to definitively say that it has identified flying sources, but I'll bet that eventually that that comes into the classes of objects that they say that they see. One of the issue with what we've called flying sauces in the past is if you're looking at a lenticular object at a distance, what does it look like? It looks like a cigar. So unless you've seen that object on in profile on its side or moving in the air in a way that allows you to see its full three-dimensional shape, I think there's a possibility that what the what the eye perceives is different from what the object is shaped like. I'm certainly getting a lot of people who are telling me that they're seeing anomalous objects that confirm conform to a a flying saucer shape. And I'd also point people's attention to the fact that one of the objects that the Skywatcher team say they're seeing is the manta, the manta ray. So, uh that that is essentially a a lenticular uh slightly triangular shaped object that slightly saucer-like. I mean, we just don't know what these objects are. We don't know how the technology works. Maybe they have the capacity to morph themselves in some way depending on where they are in what kind of atmosphere. I have no idea. There's certainly been, I think, an abundance of reports over the years going back decades to suggest that whatever these UAP are, they're capable of changing themselves in some way. So, no, I'm not ruling out the possibility that um flying sauces will conventually conform to the conventional idea of a flying saucer shape. We just don't know yet enough to know one way or the other. Okay, thank you Ross. We have time for one more. This is going to come from at Uptown Saturday. Ross and Megan. Renowned remote viewer Pat Price claimed a vast underground extraterrestrial base exists beneath Mount Zeal in Australia's Northern Territory near Alice Springs. Given your somewhat relative proximity, what details can you provide about this intriguing assertion? I've been asked about this one before and it's a great question and look, I've found the CIA records that refer to this. So, it is true. during a CIA sponsored Stargate program investigation using remote viewing. Uh, which of course the Pentagon denies the efficacy of. So why on earth did they spend millions of dollars doing the program? There's a certain idiocy to the claims that there's no basis to this psionic attitude because frankly they wouldn't have spent the money unless they knew it worked. Um, there was a remote view and in fact it's not just one remote viewer that's done this. I was reading um uh just a few days ago about a Lynn Buchanan who's done similar work as a remote viewer and the claim is that there is some kind of alien base under a place called Mount Zeal which as it happens is very close to Australia and America's most sensitive base outside the continental United States, Pine Gap, the so-called joint facility. If you were an alien species and you wanted to see what the US is really up to, you would go to a very, very remote corner of the Australian outback, slap bang in the middle of central Australia near Uluru, otherwise known previously as I rock. And on the McDonald Rangers, there is this weird place called Pine Gap, where the US has what is essentially a downlink for satellite feeds from orbit, which we know has been used to monitor for intercontinental ballistic missile launches, but I suspect also has other purposes. One of the most secret bases in the world. As for the claim of an alien base, which is about 16 kilometers further to the northwest, I understand. Um, impossible to prove because uh I've been to Mount Zeal. I've walked around Mount Zeal and just for my own fun when I was there, I had a damn good look and there ain't nothing there. There's lots of lizards, lots of deadly deadly snakes and spiders, lots of what we call scrub in Australia, small little bushes that are struggling to live against the incredibly hot sun. But um frankly, I didn't see any aliens. Well, that's unfortunate, Ross, but if anyone was going to find him, it was going to be you. So, thank you for trying. No problem at all. Uh those are all the hard ball questions I have for you today, Ross. I just want to remind people that you can email your questions to us reality check@newsnationow.com and hopefully Thank you very much Megan. Hopefully I'll be able to answer your questions with more lucidity next week. I am still struggling. I hope none of you get this co. It has really knocked me for six.

    "question": "Good day and welcome to Reality Check Q&A. I'm your host Ross Kulart and here to ask me the hard questions my colleague and friend Megan Orata. Good day Megan. How are you",
    "answer": "Ross? I'm doing great today. How about you?  Very well, thanks. Very, very well.  Well, we've had fantastic feedback from your recent episode with James Fox. I'm going to hop in. I want to first share a comment from the YouTube page, and I want your reaction to this. This guy says, \"If Dr. Davis has not been assassinated before talking about face-to-face interaction with Alien, that it's being allowed to happen as part of the ongoing slow disclosure that by design continues releasing increasingly more details over the last eight years. On this trajectory, the next eight years will be mind-blowing.\"  Wow. I I wish that was true. Um there's a great saying, and I've used it before in my line of work. Fans of the show will be familiar with my vernacular. Um always assume, should we call it a screw- up, a screw-up before a conspiracy. Um I I generally think that um there is no plan, no disclosure plan in place. I I don't think that there are people in government who are pulling the wheels and making decisions about disclosure.  [sighs and gasps]  I think there was a plan prior to the Clinton Trump election 2014 2015 uh that was shelved when the Pentagon and certain people in the intelligence community con realized that Donald Trump was going to become president and I don't think uh they saw disclosure as being inevitable because Clinton wasn't going to be the president and I think they feared she was going to expose all I don't think there is any kind of credible gatekeeper disclosure roll out going on. In fact, quite the opposite. I think that there is a bunch of gatekeepers who have rationalized in their own alpha male way. This is a secret that is best kept from the public because they really can't help themselves and they need to be protected from their own stupidity. So that's why it's important we keep on applying the pressure to make sure that uh the new administration under Donald Trump does ask the hard questions.",

    "question": "Okay, here is the question. This is from Jessica on X. Can you share what caused the long delay and getting the film out to the public? Have any more recent edits been made? Secondly, while some deception is sometimes you is used in investigations if it leads to harmful manipulation and discrimination, it is unethical and often illegal. Is there any discussion in this film about the lengths that some have gone to in order to cover up cases where humans were harmed by the phenomenon?",
    "answer": "I presume there she's talking about Moment of Contact, the re re-released James Fox film. Is that right?  Correct.  Right. So she's not talking about Age of Disclosure because there have been huge delays on Age of Disclosure. So Moment of Contact is a James Fox film that was released, I think, back in 2022. And the interview that we did with James Fox was about the fact that James has been doing incredible great investigative work securing further information with further interviewees who've taken their time to decide whether or not they want to speak publicly about what they know. Uh in in one particular case it's um Dr. uh Sylvestri I think his name is the uh it's Dr. Italo Sedestri who who's the man who's made the decision as a neurosurgeon at the regional hospital to come forward. He originally was too intimidated about speaking publicly and so you can hardly blame James or anyone else really for wanting to um uh get this guy on camera. He's been pushing the bloke for years. But it was as James explained to us in the interview that I did with him the other day. It was a decision that was prompted by his own imminent mortality. Literally, the poor doctor was suffering a heart attack, lying on the floor of the ICU, [gasps] and thinking, \"Why on earth would I be going to my grave with this incredible secret? The public has a right to know.\" And good on him. Good on the good doctor for making that decision. And we should protect and make sure that whistleblowers and uh people who speak out like him are protected. Um, I think it's so important. So, I don't think there have been unreasonable delays on what James has done. His film was originally published in 2022. And what this is is a re-release. It's an update of his moment of contact film with some quite extraordinary new interviews. One with the neurosurgeon who was a direct witness to the alleged alien being in the operating theater in the hospital. And the other is the pathologists who did the work on the poor gentleman uh Chavez I think his name was the military soldier who policeman who um died as a result of contracting a bacterial infection from the scratch as he carried the being in his car to the hospital. Um in both of those cases it just takes a while. Investigative journalism is an iterative layering process. And as I've learned over the years, quite often the best scoops come after the first initial story. People see the story and then they go, you know what, I think I can add to that. And so that's why it's really important. James actually left a an email address. If there's somebody out there, particularly people from the US who were involved in the US Air Force extraction of this being and craft to the United States. James's email, if you want to send him a tip, is moment of contact at proton.me. moment of contact at proton.me. or you can contact us here at reality check@newsnation now.com.",

    "question": "All right, Ross, we have Atlas reaching out to us on X. He says, \"At Ross Coltart, I'm excited for Fox's new movie and the release of Vera's Age of Disclosure, but I was curious if you've heard mumblings of any other upcoming projects or hopefully more congressional hearings.",
    "answer": "I'm excited too about The Age of Disclosure. I think it's going to be a cracker jackack film EPD by Lou Alzando and Dan Farah. Um, I'm aware of the people featured in it and I think what people will sit up and take notice of is that this is a film that features people from the very highest levels of the US intelligence, defense executive, people who are speaking out about the reality of the UAP phenomenon. Um, are there other things coming? Well, if we can take one takeaway from what James Fox was saying, it's clear from what James has indicated in his interview with me that there are discussions going on on the hill in Congress probably from the opaces of the oversight transparency committee. That's Rep. Luna, Rep. Tim Burchett's uh committee which is uh investigating claims of a UAP cover up. Um it does look like from what um James indicated to us that there's an effort underway to try and get some of these witnesses from the Brazilian Vajinha case to give evidence in the United States. I am aware of um other goings on uh to try and get other witnesses to come forward in Congress. But look, one of the big problems and I I keep on saying this, but I think it's important to remind people why this has been stymied. Congress has been got at. It has been knobbled. Politicians have been corrupted. They have been induced improperly to not do their job as politicians, as Congress people. They have breached their obligations of accountability and oversight because they are excessively influenced by the national security states lobbying and inducements. And so also are the staffers inside Congress. Too many of them are beholdened to the jobs that they're going to get in private aerospace after they finish their job in Congress. Too many of them see it as a lucrative stepping stone into a private aerospace career where they can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's a disgrace really when it means essentially that the capacity of Congress to do its oversight role is constrained. And there was, as we know, an attempt by several fantastic politicians to bring in UAP disclosure laws, laws that would have allowed the protection of other whistleblowers from within the legacy retrieval and reverse engineering program, particularly contractors. This was really important. I'm talking to people who are working for private aerospace companies who are telling me they want to give evidence, but there aren't the protections in place in Congress to protect contractors. That's why things are being stymied on the hill.",

    "question": "Okay, we have Charles writing us an email. He's asking, \"There continues to be a global conspiracy to withhold classified evidence regarding non-human intelligence be intelligent beings and non-human developed UAPs. What in your opinion would change that position? Thank you, Chuck.\"",
    "answer": "Oh, it's pretty clear. Um, a decision by the Trump administration to take this issue seriously. Um, I think we should take heart from recent comments by uh, Vice President Vance and uh, also previous comments by Secretary of State and now acting national security adviser Marco Rubio. Both gentlemen have indicated and they're obviously at the very top of the Trump administration just under the president. Both men have indicated they have a strong desire to get to the truth of the UAP mystery. And President Trump himself during his campaigning indicated very strongly that he wanted to see declassification of UAP files and the release of further photographs and videos. Uh I don't think there's any good reason why the Trump administration so far to date really hasn't done anything about this. What I'm being told by people inside the administration is that they've just been distracted. They've been distracted by trying to resolve peace in the Middle East, the economy, the government shutdown, and of course um uh the ongoing dreadful war in Ukraine. Uh I am assured that this is going to become an issue of concern for the Trump administration. I'm not holding my breath. I've seen other administrations make similar promises and nothing happens. But one of the things about President Trump is he is his own man. He's an iconoclast. He doesn't really care what people think. Uh he's very strong in his views and frankly he's a deep skeptic um about the people who constitute what he calls the deep state. And if if ever there was evidence of a deep state, if ever there was evidence of a group of people within the national security intelligence community who are misusing their power that is derived essentially from Congress without congressional oversight. It's the people who are controlling the legacy retrieval and reverse engineering program who are concealing this program and flat out lying to the public. The big worry I have is that there is either a presidential executive order from the Truman Eisenhower days that in some way is being used to gag successive presidents or whether there's an ongoing presidential executive directive, a peed, an emergency action directive I think they're called, which would essentially mean that there are good reasons for the president to keep this all secret. Maybe there are agreements with non-human beings as David Grush indicated back in his interview with me in June of 2023. Whatever it is, I think the public have to make it clear that this is an issue that they want investigated. We we have an ongoing crisis now in Europe. Some of Belgium's Belgium's airspace was closed yesterday and probably still is as far as I know because of drone incursions over all certain parts of Western Europe. Airports are being closed. And what's interesting is the electromagnetic pulse weapons that are normally used to dr down these so-called drones, let's call them drones, aren't working. So whatever is happening is there is a national security crisis right now in Western Europe where successive governments are finding they cannot do anything to respond to so-called drone incursions over their territory and people are pointing the finger at Russia. Is there any evidence, any solid hard evidence that Russia is responsible for this? I'm no apologist for an authoritarian dictator like Vladimir Putin, but the simple fact is no one has presented any hard evidence to show that the Russians are involved. It's based on speculation. Who or what is responsible for the drone incursions in Western Europe? These are the kind of issues I think that justify why UAPs need to be start taken seriously by governments particularly the US government because sooner or later I think people are going to smell a rat. Do they want to be fanned out and exposed for the lies they're currently telling the public? Or do they want to be leading by the chin and showing leadership and actually exposing the I I suspect illegal and in some cases criminal activities of the people that have been responsible for this program. They may think of themselves as patriots, but are they really?",

    "question": "Okay, Ross, here's an email coming in from Sebastian. Hi, Ross. and Megan, congratulations for your work. Ross, you have stated that according to your sources, the 2004 tic tac near San Diego was Loheed Martins. However, Commander Fraver said in Lex Freedman's at all that there was a gigantic structure below the water and some kind of relationship with the tic tac. That doesn't add up to the Lockheed theory unless they have reverse engineered an alien submarine. Can you elaborate on that? Thank you very much.",
    "answer": "Look, it's a good question and yes, you're correct. Um, David Fraver did report seeing an object possibly uh sitting just under the ocean where the tic tac was hovering. [gasps] I don't know if he said that there was a relationship between the tic tac and the object under the water other than the fact that the tic tac was hovering above an area of water that looked like it had something underneath it. Um, it would be speculative to suggest that David Fraver was saying that there was a relationship. I don't think he would have any evidence and I don't think he's ever suggested that there was a relationship between that object and the object that he perceived under the water. Um, all I'm saying is, and I'll reiterate this, is that sources have told me that the tic tac that was seen by David Fraver was being operated or controlled by people associated with Loheed Martin. And as I've said earlier, we don't know if that means the object was constructed by Loheed Martin. I actually think that's highly unlikely. or whether it was being operated for example psionically by psionics who were in the employee of Loheed Martin which I think is more plausible. Um it also doesn't discount the possibility that the other objects that were being seen in the area by my friend Kevin Day and witnessed by multiple people on the USS Princeton and the USS Nimttz. It doesn't rule out the possibility that those other objects that were being seen at somewhere between 28 to 80 28,000 to 80,000 ft were of nonhuman origin. I think it's highly implausible that they were all Loheed Martin objects. What I am told is that that day there was a very stupid blueonblue attempt. An attempt to test technology that was in the possession of Loheed Martin against a carrier battle fleet. And this came about as a result of a conversation I had with somebody who pointed out to me and reiterated to me something I've written about in my book that when Kevin Day had a conversation with the I think the admiral or the captain on the USS Nimmits he showed no surprise at all about the incursion by this anomalous object. You have to ask yourself why.  We have Proctor Hopkins reaching out to us on X. Has Ross looked into the Project Blue Beam claims and how they could be eerily echoing current events?  Ah, Project Blue Beam, the most hor chestnut in all of the UFO conspiracy theories. So, um, Project Blue Beam, I'm assuming this is the one you're talking about. There was a Canadian guy, I think he's now passed, called Serge Monest, and he came up with this wacky conspiracy theory, and I do think it's wacky because it didn't happen when he said it was going to happen. I think he said it was going to happen in 1995 or 1996. [gasps] And essentially it was a a staged fake alien invasion leading to eventually a luciferian conspiracy to take over the whole world in some kind of authoritarian world government. Um he wrote a book called Project Blue Beam and the really cool thing is NASA was the villain. NASA was leading this one world conspiracy. And um look, frankly, I I I think the claims of Serge Monest about Project Blue Beam are a load of hogwash. And I'm not saying that the idea of a potential staged alien invasion threat isn't a possible stunt that might be pulled by somebody in the gatekeeper group that are protecting this legacy program. That's long been a completely separate speculation by people like Dr. Steven Greer from the disclosure project and it goes back to I think claims made by a lovely woman called Carol Rosen who I've had the privilege of meeting who was wa von Brawn's assistant and a lot of people have tried to point holes in Carol Rosen's claims but essentially Carol was a PA to Dr. Vera von Brawn, the former SS officer who was a Nazi who was brought out under project paperclip and incredibly was protected and given the opportunity to run the entire Apollo space program. And one of the things about Wavon Brawn is he always said that he was reluctantly draoned into the SS. So I should make that point. But essentially, I think he was at the end of his life very skeptical and concerned about what he believed the US government was doing with its knowledge allegedly of nonhuman intelligences. And he allegedly confided to Carol Rosen, who's told me about this, and she's told many people about this, including Dr. Steven Greer, who was the first to break it, that um there was going to be some kind of staged alien invasion as an excuse to impose authoritarian control on the planet and that they would use possibly holograms and um projected images of UAP's craft as a way of constraining restraining the public and and controlling public opinion. Um is it true? I don't know. I've got no idea. I mean, it's an allegation that's been around for years. I actually don't doubt that Wernner von Brawn did say it to Carol Rosen. A lot of people have tried to point holes in Carol, but I find her credible. I think she's telling the truth. Um, I do think Weravon Brawn was worried about the potential misuse of the technologies that he allegedly became aware of that the United States was in control of. as allegedly my friend and um in informant Yuri Giller, the famous psychic told me in a previous reality check interview. He says that he was shown alien bodies by Dr. Wavon Brawn. Um I just don't think all of this is complete hogwash. There's some truth in this. I just wish I knew what it was. So yes, I think project blue beam as proposed by a Canadian guy called Serge Monest probably 30 40 years ago is a load of bollocks because it never happened. I think he said it was going to happen in the mid '90s. It didn't happen. But I think that claims that the people responsible for the legacy program might try and stage some kind of stunt. Look, I wouldn't put it past if if if Richard Dolan is right. If our friend Richard Dolan, the noted UAP academic, is right that there is some kind of breakaway civilization on this planet that essentially is using this technology to to gain some kind of superior advantage to the detriment of the rest of humankind, then um I guess it's not at all inconceivable that they might try and use some kind of fascist takeover by using a stunt such as a fake alien invasion. I don't think we should rule that out. I mean, the bottom line is this is why Congress needs to reassert control over the legacy program and stop pussyooting around and accepting it. It it needs to start digging. What really worries me is the supine dosile way that so many politicians are approaching this issue. They still titter and giggle nervously when they're asked about the UAP issue. And yet the US government has admitted that UAPs are real. There is enough on the public record now, not least since our interview with James Fox and the revelations that he's made about a likely recovery of an alien spacecraft and an alien being or beings to raise the very serious likelihood that the United States is lying through its teeth about what it has recovered. And so yes, we should be asking hard questions about what the intentions are of the people that are aware of this program and are they planning some kind of a stunt. I don't think we should rule that out. Um and I think maybe the fact that um Carol Rosen says she was told this by Wner von Brawn and that other people have speculated about some kind of fake alien invasion using recovered craft. Maybe we should take this a little little bit more seriously and maybe this is another reason why government should actually be looking at this as some kind of national security imperative rather than tittering into their coffee cups and nervously looking in the other direction when people say, \"Hey, listen. What about this UAP issue?\" And this is why you, the public, need to make it clear to your elected representatives that you're not going to put up anymore with this kind of nonsensical ridicule response to the subject of UAPs. It just doesn't wash anymore. This is a serious subject for investigation and it's worthy of investigation by our politicians and our executive representatives.",

    "question": "Okay, Ross, we will hop over to X for a question from TJ. Hi, Ross. So, the other day I was meditating and I was struck with a creepy thought. What are the chances that Kenneth Arnold was lying about the saucers he saw during his flight in Alaska? Was it a real UFO sighting or just the beginning of all alien UFO scops?",
    "answer": "I don't think there's any chance at all that Kevin Arnold was lying. And the reason I say that is because what people have missed and I I came across this when I was writing my book and looking at that that summer of 47 experience. There were sightings both before and after Ken Kevin Arnold's sighting um over I think it was Mount Reineia uh which corroborated what he said he saw. Um there was a forest service warden in a tower uh which was on the same flight path as what Kevin Arnold described and he gave a chronologically exact account of exactly the same movement of exactly the same objects at that time. There were also commercial air pilots and I think there were at least three or four other witnesses that corroborated Kevin Arnold's story. So no, I don't accept that Kevin Arnold was making this up. I actually do believe him. And moreover, if people look at the history of the summer of 47, what he was saying was not in any way unusual. This was a period of history where there was just an explosion of anomalous sightings of weird objects.",

    "question": "All right, we have an email from Caroline in Amsterdam. Hello, Ross and Megan. At the latest UAP hearing, journalist George Knapp mentioned that he had taken with him Russian UAP files. Do you know if these files are open for the public yet? And are you planning to write a new book, maybe? I loved your inplain sight. Keep on the good digging.",
    "answer": "Good question about George's files. Um, I've actually checked this with George directly. So we know that there were I think as George has actually told us it's about 200 or so documents or pages of documents that were tended as exhibits into the congressional record. Now I don't know why the full set of thread three documents have not yet been made public as I'm sure was George's intention. But what we do know is that a very limited number of those documents, I think about 22 to 25 pages in total, have been made public and they do not provide the full extent of the detail that was obtained by George. Yet again, the big question is who the hell is it in Congress that is making these decisions? The clear intent of George Knap was to make sure that those thread three three documents were made available for public consumption. Where the hell are they? And who are these anonymous staffers that are making these decisions about what should or shouldn't be made public? I I I do think we need to start rattling the cage about this stuff. And it's a very very good question. As for the question of whether I would be writing another book, books are like babies. Um, basically I'm told by women I love and know, including my beautiful wife, that u uh when you have babies, you only decide to have another one when you've forgotten how painful the last one was. Uh, it's the same with books. One of the big problems as well with books these days is so many people rip off books. Uh people don't understand that if you spend two years writing a book, often for very little financial reward as an advance up front, um the only way, the only prospect of making any money out of it to compensate you for your time is to hope that somebody might actually buy it. And the big problem is so many books now are being ripped off. They're being copied and digitized and illegally downloaded onto sites where people can download them straight away for free. It's a disincentive and it's completely undermining the whole publishing industry. While we're on the subject, by the way, I received my copy of this amazing book yesterday uh by Andy McGrillin um which is just fantastic. It's an atlas of unidentified flying objects and anomalous phenomena. It's a pear. It's got a forward from my friend Diana Walsh Pasulka and it tells the story of a lot of the more interesting UAP sightings all over the world including one of my favorites which is um actually very close to its uh 50th anniversary the uh Fred Valentic story the guy who disappeared over Bass Strait. Um I'm hoping to have Andy on at some stage to talk about that and and good on him for writing a book. I hope he makes some money out of it. Well, Ross, to put a bow on the big mystery of last week for our loyal viewers, as you can see over my shoulder, I did find your book and secure its home back on the ladder.

    "question": "[Music] Good day and welcome to Reality Check Q&A. I'm your host, Ross Kulart. This is the time when you get to ask me the hard questions. And here to help me answer them is my producer, colleague, and friend Megan Order. Good day, Megan. How was Greece? By the way, I know you were across in the Greek islands of all places. Lucky you. Yeah, Russ, it was it was so beautiful. Such a beautiful place and great to be there this time of year because it's kind of off season for tourism and travel. So, we had a nice time.",
    "answer": "Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. And uh are you going to hit me some questions first or you going to tell me about your holiday?  I think I'm going to tell you a little about my holiday because Ross, while I was there, I saw something very strange in the skies and you are the first person that I am telling my story to. So, you're going to tell me that you've seen a UAP?  Well, I'm not sure if I'm ready to call it that. I will let you be the judge of that since you are the professional there. But I will tell you what I did see. I'll set the scene. Um, we were in Santorini. It was sunset time. We're sitting outside um by the pool.  Q violin bottle of wine.  Bingo. Check. Check. Check. Um, and you know, you're looking out over the ocean trying to enjoy the beautiful sunset and I off to the left of the sun see an orb. I saw a white floating orb. Um, slow, peaceful, um, moving in a very rhythmic way. Um, and I watched it move and move and move and then it just disappeared.  How far away?  Not very far. Um, it felt like it was it was pretty close to us. It felt closer to to shore than it did over the ocean and also not very high. Um I'd say maybe quarter mile in the sky.  So it was a quarter of a mile away. And how far off the surface of the sea?  A quarter mile off the surface of the sea. I'd say even about maybe the same distance from me.  Okay. Okay. And uh how long did you watch it for? I'm going to say about 15 to 20 seconds. Um, which feels long, but it also could have been longer. You know, I felt like I was totally transfixed by this object. Um, watching it move in such a slow rhythmic pattern.  Now, I know you're on holiday with your husband. Did you Did he see it as well? Did he have a Do you have a witness?  He did not see it, but he saw me seeing it and he was looking at me like, \"What is this girl looking at?\" So when I finally kind of came too and after it disappeared it felt it seemed like it almost had a destination and when it got to that destination then it then it took off and disappeared from sight. Um so when I kind of came too he you know I looked over at him and he just said what did you just see? And I go a UAP.  So when you say it took off are you saying it accelerated fast faster than it had been moving and took off out of sight or  No. As in just it just disappeared just gone.  Yeah. So it is just floating floating floating  hit its target and then just disappeared.  When you say it's hit its target, did it go underwater?  No. Almost like this is going to sound crazy, but you know, this is reality checks. This is where we thrive in this in this realm. Um  crazy.  We thrive off of off of what I'm about to say. Um it was almost like it had um a portal that it was tracking to and it was like I'm I'm on my way. I'm on my way. Okay. And then it's like, okay, now I'm disappearing.  Wow.  It just disappear. It just disappeared into thin air. Um, and I could not find it anywhere. So then after I was like, balloon, airplane, this, that, bird. And I'm like, but then it just doesn't then why did it how did it disappear like that? How did it disappear? I'd be able to track it if it was all those other things.  So you you've gone through all the possible prosaic explanations and you can't think of anything that would fit what you saw. Um, no. An orb, an egg, I don't know. H  how how big was it if you were to I mean, obviously it's a quarter of a mile away, but how big was it? Do you estimate?  Rather large. I would say the size of of a ring light. Everyone has those now in the in the digital age. Um, it felt like about a large ring light.  What? Sorry, forgive me. From Australia. What What's a ring light and how wide is it? Oh wow. Okay.  You know the rim lights that you put in front of your camera um for good living in television. You have one.  Oh right. Okay. Yep. Yep. Yep. Gotcha. Okay. So that's pretty large. So maybe a yard across. Three feet. Three feet across.  Absolutely. Three feet.  Wow. Well, that's so that that's extraordinary. So what what I guess we should do and and if we're to be professional about this is if there's anyone else in Santorini, Greece who's watching Reality Check who's had a similar experience, Megan Arda is looking for a corroborative witness. That's that's great, Megan. Um just by the way, I'm just wondering because I'm I'm doing some work at the moment with the idea of psionic connection, people being able to connect psychically with the phenomena. Did you get any sense at all that the phenomena was there specifically for you,  Russ? I did I did not feel that in the moment, but I did feel that peaceful sense of like this isn't harmful. Like I wasn't scared in any way. Again, I was almost transfixed by it. I could not take my eyes off of it. So, when it disappeared into thin air, um I knew something was was funky with it. Well, I like the idea that it was seeking you out to make you less skeptical, Megan. So, this is this is this is a turning point for reality check. Wonderful. I love  they were like, \"Tell Ross. Make sure you tell Ross.\" So, I'm doing I'm doing their bidding.  Okay. So, let's fire away. And and by the way, if anybody does have any similar sightings, particularly from Santorini and Greece, we'd love to hear from you. And so, especially would Megan.",

    "question": "Yes. And I, you know, I'll throw up a picture right now that a viewer did send me on X of some similar orbs. These were at night, so I think the images are actually pretty pretty good. Um, my sighting was, you know, there there was still sunlight out, but just some more images of different orbs that people are seeing all around. But I will get into our first question and now I'll we'll do the viewers bidding. This comes in from Simone. Hi Ross and Megan. Thank you for providing grounded, fact checked, highquality journalism on the UAP paranormal topic. After listening to your recent interview with Joshua, I'm wondering if area 2 at Nellis Nuclear Base is on land that used to be inhabited and considered sacred by Native Americans. I'm aware that some sacred sites are rumored to have portals and paranormal experiences like shadow people attached to them. Eg. Skinwalker Ranch. Love, Simone.",
    "answer": "Hi, Simone. And I completely agree with you. That is a very good angle to explore and it's one that we did actually explore in the story. We started talking about the skinwalkers from Skinwalker Ranch. I'm told that yes, there is a Native American a strong Native American connection to this particular area and yes, shadow people or shadow beings are part of that mythology. Uh so yeah, maybe that's what they saw. Um I just don't know. We've had a huge reaction to Joshua's uh interview. Uh and it's interesting because a lot of people It's interesting. A lot of people are saying, well, you know, he's just another person making anecdotal claims. And it's not anecdotal at all. It's a direct firsterson witness who has provided testimony to the Federal Bureau of Investigations. And moreover, I can tell you his testimony is corroborated by at least two other witnesses that the FBI are reaching out to. So this is a well-corroborated triple corroorated story of odd paranormal going on at one of the most sensitive nuclear installations in the world. And um I I I do think yes, the possibility that this paranormal explanation might be shadow beings of some kind in accordance with Native American mythology is a very plausible possible explanation.",

    "question": "All right, another question on the Yosua interview. This is from Katherine. Hi Megan and Ross. My question is around the excellent interview Ross conducted with Yosua Shelton. Do you think the shadow figure spotted at Area 2 and other nuclear sites are remote viewers? Best wishes from the UK.",
    "answer": "It's funny, you know, I've never heard of remote viewers manifesting physically. Um my It's funny, I was only talking to somebody about this last night. There's um remote viewing is somebody remotely perceiving a location, but they're not geoloccating. They're not they're not basically taking their corperial body there. I don't know a lot. I don't pretend to know a lot about remote viewing, but one thing that's quite interesting is a number of remote viewers, and if you read the history of the Stargate program, a number of remote viewers have related how when they've been remote viewing a site and there's an alleged non-human entity there. They somehow perceive the nonhumans there. The nonhumans perceive the the human there. Uh, but I don't think that when you're remote viewing, you're physically manifesting a representation of yourself to whatever or whoever is in the location. I I think that essentially it's a transfer of consciousness, if it's anything at all. And essentially it's an ability to geo uh remotely perceive a location. Uh, and I I don't think that the person is manifested in any way on that location. So I don't think it could be somebody who was remote viewing area 2. No.",

    "question": "Okay. We will go to a question from Chris on X. Hi Megan, how are you hun? I am good. Can you ask Ross what his thoughts are on NASA cutting the live feed from Mars when three Atlas went past? Everything was going well. Then they turned into a gray screen. What are they hiding?",
    "answer": "You know, it's funny. I never believed any of the NASA conspiracy theories until very very recently. I always thought it was nonsense that NASA cut the feed. And I now realize someone is cutting the feed because I've seen it. I've actually seen it happen. Um I can't comment one way or the other about the three eye atlas feed being cut because frankly I just don't know if it was. I I I assume that there was a disruption. And look, disruptions do happen to transmissions. Obviously, it's a big thing to be able to receive or send a a transmission across space. So, it wouldn't surprise me at all if occasionally there are disruptions. But I'll tell you my story, which I have told before, but I was um invited uh to tour as a VIP the Marshall Space Center when I was giving a speech at the Huntsville Scientific Coalition for the Study of UAPs two years ago. And it was a great opportunity and I remain very grateful to the local director of NASA on location who very kindly ushered me around with the wife of another former NASA administrator Mike Griffin. And while we were on location in the viewing room where there's a huge bank of video feeds from the space station, the International Space Station, um we were looking at the feeds with the director of the Marshall Space Center talking to me uh with his back to those screens. And there's the control room for the receiving of signals and control of the space station to my right that we're looking at through this glass window. And as he's talking to me, Rebecca nudges me and goes, \"Look.\" And there are maybe eight or nine eggshaped objects moving from behind the space station. And the camera is pointed out into interstellar space, and you see these egg-shaped objects just tracking along in formation very, very slowly. And I very naively ask the director of the Marshall Space Center, is, \"Excuse me, sir. Is are they Starlink satellites? Has somebody just released Starlink satellites?\" And he turns, looks at the feed, sees the objects, and then he looks through the window into the main control room and they flick a switch and they do it right in front of us. Transmission to the space station has been interrupted. Now, I I don't know what happened. I'm not suggesting any sinister motive on the part of the director of the Marshall Space Center, but I saw it happen and so did two other people, including the wife of a former NASA administrator. So, it happened. And the the thing that interested me was it almost seemed to be routine. And when I went back to try and look at feeds to see if I could find what I'd seen, it wasn't there. So, I've seen a disruption to the feed and it made me feel very very uncomfortable. What I was seeing was clearly anomalous to people in the room and uh I never got an explanation. The um the director went and he had to move on because he was committed on other tasks. But I never got an explanation for what that was, which remains profoundly interesting. As for the 3i Atlas uh video feed disruption, I didn't see it happen. I don't know anything about it, but I can tell you I've seen strange disruptions to the feeds, the video feeds through NASA.",

    "question": "All right, very interesting. We will go to another question from X. Hi, Megan. Please, could you ask Ros these so-called drones cannot be tracked back to source with all the modern technology? It baffles me. Kind regards, Neil in Yorkshire. That is the $99 million question. I find it utterly baffling that we have spent literally billions, trillions of dollars on defense, particularly in Western Europe, which of course is the forward line against any Russian offensive that might take place. And so an enormous amount of money has been spent on basically counter UAS technology, counter air technology. You know, we we're basically meant to have the top air surveillance technology in the world. You're telling me that we cannot in any way follow, track, or detect these drones, supposed drones, when they appear, it just doesn't wash to me. And I really do think now that we know that these sightings are continuing, including in Santorini, Greece clearly. But now that we know that these objects are still manifesting themselves over Western Europe, it's still going on. There's still no explanation. There's still no admission from anyone in authority that they have any idea what these objects are. They've not been able to track them. They've not been able to follow them. It It's just a baffling mystery. And what I find extraordinary is these stories happen as they happened in New Jersey, continental United States last year. They come and then the mainstream media forgets about the issue and moves on and everybody goes, \"Oh yeah, yeah, what about that drone issue a few years ago?\" And it's never explained. I am told that this is an ongoing mystery that has not been resolved. It's an issue of huge concern. The explanation that it's the Russians is the default explanation purely and simply because they have no bloody idea. And the interesting thing is the Russians have categorically denied it as they would of course if they were doing this. One of the possibilities in my head still is that this might be highly advanced Chinese technology. That the Chinese have made some kind of technological breakthrough that allows them to have droneike objects loitering on position for many hours on end with no visible means of propulsion and obviously highly stealth capabilities that allow them not to be tracked or detected. But really there's no evidence for that. Uh why would the Chinese do that? I guess I'm just speculating that maybe they're trying to provoke some kind of a a conflict between the the West and the East, but really nobody has any idea. And I find that absolutely fascinating when you consider the trillions of dollars that every nation is spending on national defense. You seriously tell me that we cannot follow a solid drone-like object hovering over a civil or military aviation facility of great national security sensitivity. This is a disgrace. And I I think also the fact that a lot of the mainstream media is failing to realize the significance of the admissions being made by official. I mean, the most recent comments from the Denmark authorities and indeed from Norway are that they really truly have no idea what these objects are. They haven't been able to track them or follow them. Yes, there's been technology brought in for quite some time now. American, German technology brought in to try and track and bring down these objects. There's been no public statement made about what these objects are or whether there's been any successful tracking, detection, or shootown. I find that just absolutely extraordinary. What does it say about the fact that something someone is able to operate over the most sensitive military and civilian facilities in Western Europe and indeed across the continental United States and the United Kingdom with complete impunity. I I for the life of me do not understand why that is not a major national security issue. And I appreciate the news has been pretty busy right now with the news in the Middle East, but have have you noticed how quickly the story dropped off the front page and how quickly so much of the mainstream media stopped covering it? One thing I can assure you is we are not going to let go of the issue on Reality Check or News Nation. We continue to ask the hard questions",
    "answer": "like a dog with a bone, right, Ross?  Absolutely. All right, here comes Shai um bouncing off of what you just said. Do you think that the current administration will truly get its hands dirty with disclosure with Middle East issues coming to certain closure, Trump searching Nobel Prize, and Rubio called quote greatest secretary of state in history? Would they really take a risk with this issue even with all the testimonies made to Congress?  Okay, I think the bigger risk is not disclosing. The bigger risk is the public discovers very soon, eventually inevitably that they've been lied to for decades. Does Trump, does President Trump want to be the president to presided over the continuing cover up? I can tell you that there are people in his administration and in his family who want disclosure. And I I do think there's a push back by the national security state and the intelligence community. the number of intelligence community bots that try and meddle with the comments in our program in reality check and the numerous bots that try and infest social media commentary are becoming so conspicuous and so obvious they use denigration, attack, ridicule, contempt, anything to try and shut down the story and it's not working because the public want answers. I've never had a story before as a journalist that is so high-profile, so highly visible. People really care about this issue.  Right here is Gonzalo from X. Ross has hinted he's going to Peru. Has he thought about seeing the non-human tridactyl corpses available for research at the university at the University of Inca?  Great question. Yes, I am going to Peru, Bolivia, and Easter Island in about three or four weeks. Really excited to do that. that I host tours occasionally. I was in Egypt last year and yes, I will be bringing you whatever I can from Bolivia, Peru, and Easter Island on the megalithic mysteries there, including I hope on a story related to the tridactyls. I've been in touch with Tierry Yamin, who's one of the more prominent investigators into this issue, and yes, I do hope to bring you something on this, I hope, relatively soon.",

    "question": "All right, another question from Access from Demon Watch. Any comment on Jason Stan's claims that humans are a slave race and our governments are controlled by NHI?",
    "answer": "Look, I have to say I don't know how Jason knows that. I've spoken extensively to Jason. It's not something that he ever told me that he knew from any of his work. So, if this is something that he's recently revealed, I haven't heard him say this. It's not something that he told me as a journalist in his very early days. I'm not saying it's not true. It's just that one of the things you look for when you are testing people's allegations and claims is whether what they're revealing is something that they've known in the course of their work or whether it's something that they're speculating about that they just think happened or that they've been informed about. I'd just like to see more rigorous questioning to get to the bottom of why he says what he says.  Okay, here is Dharma Lion. Hi Ross. Have you looked into scientist Amy Escridg's possibly suspicious death and her anti-gravity research and comments on disclosure with your recent coverage of triangular anti-gravidic craft? Who are the scientists working on this? Thanks. Keep up the great great work. Jamie,",

    "question": "I actually spoke to Amy Escri. I I um I don't think she killed herself. I I do think there's a very high likelihood she was murdered. Um, I've got a very good friend who was a very, very good friend of hers who was being sent emails by her in the months prior to her death where she genuinely feared that somebody was trying to hurt her or kill her. And I've seen I've got photographs, harrowing photographs of burns that she allegedly suffered from some kind of directed energy weapon that she believes was directed at her from the street through the window of the office that she was working in. And they are harrowing images showing burns on her hands where literally there's a a red mark that starts just from her hands and it it's as if her hands across a keyboard were being irradiated with something. Um, I I do think that the instance of the Amy Escridge case is quite extraordinary. There's a whole lot of unexplained stuff. The difficulty is that her body was apparently cremated shortly after her death. Her family and I have no wish to cause her family any hurt. Her family do uh I understand believe that she committed suicide. Um, I don't want to speak for the family or purport to speak for the family because it's always a tragedy when anyone loses a loved one. The the terrible thing is there was no full coronial inquiry. I I did make inquiries with local police about why there wasn't going to be a full coronial inquiry and it was because of the finding of suicide. Um, I I feel very sad about the Amy Escridge death. She was a brilliant woman. She was at times unstable. She was a big drinker. Um, but I don't think she killed herself. I truly don't think she killed herself. Uh, I'm sorry if that upsets the family, but I think she was a wonderful human being. Um, she was making claims that she was making advances in anti-gravitic technology and propulsion systems. And of course, her father was is I'm not sure if he still is a senior NASA engineer. Um it's a great tragedy that she was lost. She was a beautiful, brilliant young woman. And yes, she's one of multiple scientists I I I have spoken to or am speaking to who purport to be working on alternative propulsion systems. That's an area that I am exploring. If anyone wants to tell me any more about Amy or indeed anything about alternative propulsion systems that might explain the weird and anomalous objects in our skies, I'm always happy to hear from you.",

    "question": "Okay, we have an email from Cal Ross. Is there any new information on the September 10th, 2025 incident where a Hellfire missile bounced off an ORB UAP? Everyone, even the legacy media, covered it, but still haven't heard back if it was analyzed and verified as real footage, not CGI or AI. No info on how high off the ocean seen zooming past. Field of view, if it was slow-mo or real time. I still doubt it's real as the hellfire wanders in and out. Doesn't detonate. Very suspect in my honest opinion. Disturbing either way, real or not. Thanks, Cal.",
    "answer": "Look, I'm told the reason it didn't detonate, Cal, is because it wasn't an explosive charge. It was one of those um horrible flail weapons where it basically flails into an object with blades and cuts the object to par. And I have to be honest with you, that to me suggests that maybe the object was is a balloon. But what puzzles me is why there's been no official comment to explain this. It would be very very easy for Congress to ask specific questions of the defense department about that video and get a very quick answer. And I don't think we should jump to conclusions. Uh I would also like to see the rest of the imagery. There's apparently more seconds of imagery that complete that image that might provide an answer for us. Um, what frustrates me again is this is Congress asking questions, legitimate questions about a video that has been leaked, I presume, to them from someone who was concerned that this video potentially showed something anomalous. That should be investigated. Congress should be given an explanation. And if Congress isn't given explanation, then we have to ask why. Who is running America? This is a government of the people, for the people, by the people. Congress is essentially sovereign under American constitutional democracy. It should have the right to ask questions. And what I'm really heartened about is that chairperson Anna Paulina Luna of the transparency committee subcommittee and the oversight committee, she's actually now apparently moving forward to ask interrogatories of potentially hostile witnesses in the defense department and intelligence community who may not want to answer questions. And this is one of those questions we should be getting answered. It it really is time for Congress to start getting clever. I I don't mean to detract from the significance of the recent UAP hearing because like everyone else, I enjoy seeing the UAP subject being given a high public profile by our elected political representatives. But I do think it's time for Congress to take the gloves off and start asking the hard questions. Let's subpoena Admiral Thomas Wilson, who by the way is a good man, a former J2 in the Defense Department, who allegedly, and I'm saying pretty surely, did uh respond to questions from Dr. Eric Davis that comprise the so-called um uh Wilson documents, which essentially describe his efforts to try and investigate the legacy retrieval reverse engineering program. Why was a deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency threatened with his job if he continued investigating whether or not there was this retrieval reverse engineering legacy program with UAPs? Let's call some of these witnesses. Let's bring them in under duress if necessary. Let's do it first in a skiff if that's required to protect some sensitive national security issues. But let's get answers to these questions, including these unexplained images of anomalous objects, potentially anomalous objects, because frankly, I can't answer your question because we don't have any further information. That's the simple answer. There has been no further information. The Defense Department does what it always does, which is refuse to answer public questions. And while we're at it, we're actually in a very grim time right now with the Pentagon. Um, sadly, Defense Secretary Pete Hgsith has brought in laws or proposed changes which would essentially require media to prevet whatever they get from people in the defense department with the defense department. And that's antithetical, I think, to good journalism. And I'm really pleased to see all of the major networks are refusing to comply with that expectation. And as a result, they're having their Pentagon accreditation removed. Sadly, I I I've got every respect for people in uniform. I have no doubt that we are in need of protecting national security secrets. But good journalism is often part of that process. And I've spoken to many generals, intelligence officials who respect and understand why the media need to ask questions. It's a good, healthy part of a functioning democracy. In the past, it's exposed things that should be exposed. war crimes, failures, equipment mismanagement, that kind of thing's important. They need to be exposed. And you just have to ask, why is the defense department not asking answering basic questions about UAPs? And why is the mainstream media for the main just so willingly complacent and compliant in refusing to push and to keep on pushing for answers to those questions? I I just think it's a disgrace. It really is a a disgrace the way the mainstream media allow themselves to be supinely tickled on the tummy by defense and intelligence officials who feed them stories and they just don't see the obvious stories sitting right under their nose. I mean, just coming back to the drone issue for a moment, by any measure, if you're a national security correspondent, a defense correspondent, what is going on at the moment over the continent of the United States, across Western Europe and the United Kingdom, is a national security disgrace. There are objects that are with apparent impunity breaching the airspace of highly sensitive civil and military, national security installations. The governments of those countries don't have answers. Why not? And why is the public not getting answers? And more importantly, why is so much of the mainstream media not pushing for an answer? That that's the big question.  Okay, Ross, thank you so much. That will do it for today.  Well, have we gone half an hour? That's amazing.  It flies by.  I I want a full drawing of your sphere. Uh, one thing I was going to ask you is when you say it was white, was it pure white or was it translucently pearly white? Like were there colors white moving with it?  No, I didn't see any any color movement. You know, we've had reports before um like from Kasein, you know, about like if you throw a pebble at it, it looks like it would ripple. It didn't look like it had that water feature like that. It was more of a a pearl, like a shiny bright pear, translucent pearl. Oh, okay. Great. Wonderful. Well, it's great for you to have shared your story. And if there's anyone out there from Santorini who saw what Megan Orata saw, we would like a corroborative witness. Thank you very much, Megan.

    "question": "All right, let me fire away at you. I'm going to start with an email coming in from Chris. He said to us, \"Hello, Ross. Hope you've been keeping well. I have two questions for you. Have you ever had to walk away from a lead because it was too dangerous or unverifiable? And what's the most compelling piece of evidence you've seen that hasn't been made public yet? Thank you for your tire, tireless work on the subject.\" [laughter]",
    "answer": "Oh, that's a very ambit claim question. Um yeah, I've walked away from leads. I mean, journalists walk away from leads all the time largely because we can't corroborate them. Um we we have to operate according to a very strict rigorous set of rules in order to avoid running nonsense. And um uh yeah, I mean I I get told things all the time. There are a lot of people who get very frustrated that I I I don't uh elevate certain people, certain commentators who make sweeping assertions. One of the one of the most difficult ones is people who contact me and I actually have some respect for these people who who purport to be in some kind of psychic or telepathic communication with a non-human intelligence and they want me to put their message out to the great ether. Uh you guys. and they think that what they've got is the absolute truth of what's really going to happen. And the difficulty is I've sat down and put all these things onto a timeline with about a hundred different people telling me different things and they often disagree. Um, you know, one of the good examples about that is the claims of catastrophic events that are meant to be imminent. Uh, people say 2027, people say 2034. Uh, I really I mean I've been told certain things. I've been told, you know, calamitous geologic events, calamitous um humaninduced events. Uh I I'm not really in a position to be able to say with any certainty that I can give any of them any credibility. And I think we do have to we're often accused by the debunker nut jobs of basically straying too far on the fringe on this show. And frankly, I think we're extremely cautious and rigorous and as objective as we can be. Uh what an amazing time, by the way, in science and UAPs. Who would have thought a year ago that my friend and colleague Dr. Beatric Diller would be putting two peer reviewed pat papers into the um uh scientific reports uh out of the nature publications group. You know something that's been exposed to that degree of peer review and rigor would have been thought of as unthinkable a year ago. So we are making advances. You know there are things happening but we still have to stick to rigorous peer review and checking and corroboration and that's the main thing why I get cautious. A lot of people ask me if I've been threatened. Um no not really. I mean I I think thankfully because I have an audience uh you know you guys are interested and engaged. I think the days when the national security state or whoever is responsible for this cover up felt that they could intimidate somebody like me uh are I hope well and truly over because we would broadcast it far and wide if anybody tried to gag us. In fact, bring it on guys. We we'd love a fight. Okay, our next question actually relates to Dr. Villar Roll. Hi. Hi, Megan and Ross. Could there be a connection between these metal spheres discovered by Dr. Villa role and those photographed and videoed by the custodian file channel. Could these metal spheres be observing us both in outer space and in our skies? David,  look, it's not just the custodian uh channel that's doing this. I mean, there are many channels on YouTube that are reporting on these metallic spheres that have been seen all over the world. I get videos almost every week from people showing me images of what people claim are metallic spheres with no visible means of propulsion. There's no propellers, there's no turbines, no jets. There's no indication of what's propelling these objects, but they are moving silently, fast, uh clearly under intelligent control all over the world. And yes, I I do think that we should be examining and investigating the hypothesis that there is a link between what Dr. Beatatric Viller has detected in geostationary earth orbit uh around about what 40,000 km away from the planet. Uh there are these highly specular reflective flat surfaces that are clearly there artificial structures that were there in the 1950s and I suspect are still there. And interesting, isn't it interesting that Beatatric has discovered this with good science, but you've got spacebased telescopes that would be perfectly capable of getting imagery of these objects. And just witness the deafening silence from organizations like NASA, James Webb telescope, um other space-based telescope operations that are being operated by some of the three-letter agencies. They could resolve this scientific mystery very quickly. Why don't they? Do they already know the answer? That that's the kind of questions I think we should be asking. I think we're at a point now in the disclosure narrative where it's becoming patently clear that Congress has become captive, as it always has been, to the national security state. And we're not going to see any real activism from most of the people in Congress. There are the heroes who we all respect and admire mainly the members of the um oversight transparency committee. But the uh the simple fact is Congress has been knobbled. The key committee chairman chairpeople have basically been knobbled and more importantly their staffers are captive to the future jobs they're looking forward to in respective private aerospace companies. It's quite depressing and sad. And so the best hope for us all is good science is good rigorous public community-based investigation that breaks open this walnut. And I do think that's going to happen. Just keep on chipping on. Okay, we'll go to our next question. Hi Ross and Megan. Can you tell me your thoughts on SETI? I find it strange that some leading scientists such as Gary Nolan and the like are saying NHI are real and yet SETI are spending millions on searching for the WOW signal. It makes no sense to me. Don't they talk to each other? They can't both be right. Love the show. Martin and Allison in the UK.  Look, we've done a previous reality check on SETI. We interviewed the boss of SETI and whilst I respect any scientific investigation into the subject of possible extraterrestrial life. I have asked and I did ask at the time, why is SETI so focused on radio signals? Would an highly advanced alien civilization likely be using radio signals to communicate when they move at the best at the speed of light and frankly they take a hell of a long time to cover multiund light years across a solar system. It's not the best way to communicate. And we know now theoretically that it is possible to to communicate using um quantum communications, entangled uh photon cubits. And the whole possibility exists that it would be possible to have a communication system using entangled photons that could instantaneously communicate communicate across vast distances of the universe. And I'm not the one that thought of this. There's actually a great paper that I recommend to you. I've I'm I'm a fan of this paper. It's called on interstellar quantum communication and the fermy paradox by a guy called Lean Boille. And uh he was part of the Higs Center for Theoretical Physics. And back in 2024, he actually wrote a paper that speculated that the reason we're not hearing from aliens in terms of communications on SETI is because they don't use radio waves. Perhaps they're using quantum communications. And he suggested that interstellar quantum communication is the likely way it's happening. And this would render the signals effectively silent or undetectable to our current classical radio or optical detection systems. And it's funny, you know, because when we asked City about this, they've spent probably, I think, last estimates was around about a half a billion dollars, some of that private money, public contributions since 1960 through to the present day. So over 65 years, half a billion dollars has been spent on radio communications interception to see if we can find alien civilizations that might be communicating using radio waves. And what have we heard? Nutter. Okay, there's the wow signal, but that's still up in the air. Bottom line is I don't think if there are aliens, and I suspect there are, I don't think they're using radio signals at all. It doesn't make a lot of sense. Why use why use radio signals when you can use, you know, why go analog when you can go digital?",

    "question": "Correct. Um, let's go to X. This is Ben for reality check. Does Ross know of any undersea structures that have been encountered by any Navy? Does he know if there are designated no-go areas for the Navy to go in regarding potential undersea USO activity? Fantastic work as always, both of you.",
    "answer": "That's a really good question. Yes, I am privy there's a guy from the Royal Australian Navy who contacted me who will not go on the record, but he it's secondhand information, but it's pretty reliable. his dad who was in the Navy told him that there are areas off the Australian coast that are, how does one say this, known to the Australian Navy. And um it was really interesting because sadly um uh his dad has passed away in the interim, but um he gave me an enormous amount of detail about a location off the Australian coast and I would love to go and investigate it. If anybody's got a submarine and a sonar system, we'll go out there and check it out. I'm a huge fan of the idea, the theory that there are megalithic civilizations, including perhaps the idea of Atlantis that have been buried as, you know, tectonic movements have happened on the earth. And I've always been interested in a case that happened um about 2 or 3 years ago. There was a couple that came forward and they had uh allegedly using highbeam soda sonar discovered pyramids and entire cities with streets under the ground um just off the coast of Cuba. And like so many of these stories, this story came and went Zizz. But there are the most amazing sonar images of what do look like I think it's about 600 m under the ocean. They do look like um pyramids underneath the ocean and straight streets. These are not naturally occurring objects as one Cuban scientist tried to suggest at the time. So yes, I'm fascinated by the idea also of megalithic uh civilizations and structures. There's also, don't forget, that weird shape that appeared on Google Maps, which was underwater. I'm not quite sure how Google Maps could represent something that was underwater. It was underwater just off the coast of California. And I think from memory, Rear Admiral retired um Tim Galedet uh mentioned that it was a subject of interest for him. And interestingly enough, soon after it became public, it was quietly blurred on Google Maps. Now, just a bit of a heads up, we are going to be taking a very close interest in underwater submerged objects on a future reality check special for News Nation. And you're going to be hearing a whole lot more from us about the subject of underwater objects. Um, there are no go areas. I've spoken to people in our submarine service in Australia, people in the submarine service in the US. There are definite nogo areas in uh parts of the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean. Um but more often than not, they're ranges that are used for gunnery practice and um uh military training. But of course, one of the best ways to hide something that you don't want the public to know about would be to secure it off as a secure military area. So yeah, maybe there is something down there. We just don't know. I have had a succession of submariners contact me from US, British, French, and Australian submarine services who have quietly told me about confrontations with enormous objects underwater, often traveling, believe it or not, at faster than the speed of sound in water, which is mind-boggling if you think about it. So, um, yeah, I am fascinated by the idea that there are, if you think about it, you know, so much of the Earth's surface is covered with water. And if you were a nonhuman civilization trying to stay out of sight, but also wanting to monitor these primitive apes up on the land, the water would be a good place to hide.",

    "question": "I definitely agree. Let's go to an email. This is from Will in Texas. Why does it seem that for over 50 years, the media, including movies and entertainment, have been slowly exposing us to the concept of aliens, largely a threat narrative, and some whistleblowers have come forward with the same narrative. Yet, the government and military-industrial complex had numerous opportunities to come forward based on this long-standing preparation, but hasn't come clean. Do you think it is that the news would be a shock to civilization or more that it would disrupt special interests in energy and control that some don't want to give up? Also tell Megan she is the best ever especially with Bigfoot will in [laughter] Texas. [gasps]",
    "answer": "Um look, yeah, I mean you're right. The threat narrative has been a consistent theme in Hollywood. Aliens as threat and it goes right back to the 40s and the 50s when the first Alien movies started uh started coming. But there are the odd exceptions, notably Steven Spielberg. And I'm really looking forward to Steven Spielberg's imminent movie. I'm told it's going to be very interesting. Uh, let's not forget also that um David Grush has been an adviser. It's been reported on a future Jerry Brookenheimr film that's going to be investigating the covert cover up inside government and private aerospace. So, there are some great movies coming. But yes, you're right. there is a Hollywood threat narrative. And yes, there is an argument in ufology that the threat narrative is wrong and that most um nonhuman intelligence engagements or encounters by humans have been benevolent and friendly, but not all of them. I mean, I I keep on thinking of the Calar incidents in Brazil where people were in fact killed or maimed with some kind of bean weapon. There have been incidents where there's been malevolence or at the very least indifference by a non-human intelligence reportedly towards human beings. Um, what do I favor? I guess I'm hoping that a non-human intelligence is benevolent, kind, and probably interested in our future survival. Or maybe what they're interested in is preserving our planet. Maybe it's not us they're worried about. It's what we're doing to our planet. Maybe there's something special about Earth that they're trying to preserve. Um, whatever it is, I I do think I I agree. I mean, I think there's definitely been a threat narrative pushed in Hollywood. And this isn't to be dismissed because many Hollywood movies are influenced directly by the Pentagon. They've literally had people who in return for the use of Pentagon resources, you know, we'll give you a Huey Chopper if you push this particular line in your movie. That's been a consistent way that Hollywood has been controlled and influenced by the Pentagon and by the intelligence community. And um there is some great books that you can read that talk about the way that Hollywood has been influenced by particularly the CIA. And what's quite interesting is the guy at the CIA who was involved in doing that liaison with Hollywood actually talked quite openly about how while he was working in the CIA, he stumbled across documents that verified I think the Roswell incident as being a non-human intelligence event, he somehow disappeared from public site. I hope he's all right. Um, yeah, let's keep on digging. And uh I'm certainly hoping and expecting that the new Spielberg movie in particular is going to be a very interesting one. I've often thought Steven Spielberg was very well informed.",

    "question": "Okay, we will go to an email. This is from Redeye. Um he says, \"I need to apologize. I used to chuckle at people that believed in UFOs, skinwalker, catamulations, and shadow people. No more. You, Alzando, Melon, Nell, Knap, and Nolan have detailed firsthand accounts from such credible, honest, and believable people. I am convinced about NHI. However, questions still linger. Based upon your interview with Yosua, what is your best guess as to the connection between cattle mutilations near and nuclear bases/ UFOs? Seems like a disconnect. Also, could shadow people, skinwalkers, etc. be an artifact of perception created by NHI to create a shell of ridiculousness to foster ridicule. Much like the Bell test pilot flying out of the Edwards, Jack Woolams who wore a gorilla mask, derby hat, and cigar and their attempts to discredit people that witnessed their flights.",
    "answer": "That's a really interesting question. It's funny. I was actually thinking about this yesterday. I was watching something that was talking about this exact issue. You know, why are there cattle mutilations? Well, firstly, maybe the aliens like beef, but that's not really a plausible uh explanation because most of what's taken in cattle mutilations is not actually the prime cuts. Often it's um areas of the face, often the skin, the tissue all around the skull, some of the internal organs like um the amassum inside the cow, one of the internal stomachs. um you know, frankly, they're not the most um delicious or dectable items in in the beef. I I'm drawn to a theory. I I'll throw this out there. It's totally speculative, but I'm drawn to a theory that cattle mutilations, a lot of what we see, a lot of what humans are being shown is performance art. that what it is is a non-human intelligence trying to wake us up, trying to kindle a human awareness that there is something else. U maybe cattle mutilations are just a way of completely freaking us out that whatever this is, it's anomalous. It's unusual. Well, there is there is one explanation that I'm prepared to give an airing that the speculation that Yakob Kfelt's disease is an issue of concern and that there's been some kind of monitoring program. I think it's called BSE boine inopathy uh uh virus. Uh we've had to kill cows in the UK I remember at one stage and I think it's happened in the US as well. We're very strong in Australia about monitoring it. we're always getting in trouble with the Americans because we're we're very restrictive on beef imports because we're trying to protect our local industry. And maybe there's an awareness about some kind of disease that's spreading inside the cattle population. The problem with that theory is it's not just cattle. Uh there are mutilated horses that I've investigated here in Australia, mutilated kangaroos. Um, something is doing performance art with animals. [snorts] And I do find cattle mutilations. I'll be honest about it. It's a freaky mystery. Uh, and it's still happening. I I get messages about alleged mutilations of animals, not just cattle, almost probably every month or so, to every two or three weeks. And uh, the most recent ones I've had have been in the American Midwest. I've seen some of them have been reported in the American media and I've even spoken to both an FBI team and also to Canadian investigators that have been investigating cattle mutilations up in British Columbia. Something is going on. Either it's a bunch of humans going around causing mischief, but if they are, they've got very sharp knives and they're doing kind of laser cuts that defy explanation. You know, these are animals which are found often with literally all of the skin, all of the tissue, including whatever you call the tissue in between the teeth. Um, literally all of the tissue has been excised from the animal. And what you're seeing is a a perfectly normal animal below the head. And then above the head, it's like just a skull. And uh, it's weird because the bone's still got moisture in it. And I can't explain it. I don't know why any non-human intelligence would want to do something like that unless it's trying to freak us out. Um, and it is it's pretty scary. The the implications of it are quite scary. But why what the motivations are for why they or it is doing it, I have no bloody idea. Absolutely not. If anyone's got any suggestions, please let me know.  Okay, this is the Steve on X. Hey Megan and Ross, thanks for your dedication and first class reporting on the UAP subject. I've heard a couple of things about our son being more than we know. And I was wondering if Ross had heard anything about this apart from the recent Jesse Michaels interview with Dan Sherman.  Just for those of you who haven't seen it, I strongly recommend you do watch. It was a great effort [clears throat] by Jesse. Um he finally scored the interview that um a lot of us have been trying to get with Dan Sherman um who wrote a fantastically intriguing book hinting at the fact or suggesting very overtly that the United States Air Force has indeed been working with people who have psychical psionic abilities for quite a long time. Dan described how uh during his service in the Air Force, he was enlisted into a secret program where he was essentially um taught how to telepathically communicate with non-human intelligences and to relay communications most of which he had no understanding of to and from uh both humans and nonhumans. Uh it implied that there was a very organized program being run through the opaces of the National Security Agency. And look, frankly, I find Dan Sherman highly credible. uh you know he he tells a absolutely amazing story but it does mesh with accounts that I've had from other people inside the national security uh infrastructure uh who tell me that there are still ongoing uses of psionics inside the system. I'm not sure that the program uh project preserve destiny that Dan was part of is still operating but uh it does intrigue me that um uh you know he he did describe his own communications with nonhumans and Jesse's done a marvelous job I think it's several hours it runs for about three hours interviewing Dan in great detail and uh you can also get his book Above Black uh on Amazon and uh one of the things he talked about to come to the question is he talked about how in one of the conversations he had with the purported non-human intelligence it told Dan that we humans do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of our sun and um the nonhuman intelligence implied that the sun is used as some kind of a portal uh almost had a reverential tone directed towards the sun that we humans don't yet realize its full significance we merely see it as a source of light and energy, but um uh we would eventually understand the significance of the sun at some time in the future. And I made notes at the time because I thought it was actually quite significant what he told Jesse. Um he had a an alien called which he nicknamed bones and another one called Spock. And he explained they think around time. It's not linear like ours. And then this this whole thing with solar portals. The sun's not just a star. It's a nexus point. You go in one side and you're out in another system. Sounds a bit like the sun's some kind of black hole. And um what I loved about this is that it it it conjoins with ideas that I've read about in physics papers about the first three paragraphs I can understand where they talk about Einstein Rosen bridges wormholes and is the sun capable of being a wormhole. Sherman suggests that they are stabilized by the sun's immense gravitational and electromag magnetic energy which makes our sun a preferred entry and exit point for visitors to Earth's solar system. I loved all this idea and I thought it was great how much detail Dan had about it. Um he claimed that um aliens harness the sun's energy via Dyson spherelike structures or plasma manipula manipulation echoing the Kardashive type 2 civilization scale where a society can fully utilize a star's energy. and he said um the the sun is some kind of portal to other star systems like a Dyson sphere but more harnessing it for jumps. And then um at one point I I made a lot of notes about this cuz I was really struck by it. He recounted a telepathic exchange where an entity expressed awe about our sonly humans undervalue it. quote, he was talking about how we really don't understand the value of our son and that we will at some point eventually understand it. It was this profound reverence like the sun is the creator, the source. And he then went on to say how the alien had told him these portals connect all the stars in a kind of network. It's why they revere creation so much. The sun isn't just energy. It's the loom weaving realities. And um uh it's interesting because uh Dan I actually quite like his brain. He talked about Capernacus and how Capernacus had this idea, a very mystical conception of the sun beyond just being an orbiting star. It's like he knew it was a portal. So yeah, I mean there are some ideas here and it's part of a broader um uh a broader UFO narrative. You know, if you think about um uh the suggestions that there are craft using exotic propulsion systems, maybe this is what they're doing. Maybe they are using some kind of wormhole near our sun. And it it might explain these weird images that people sometimes publish which show gigantic apparent craftlike objects near the sun that seem to be doing something with the sun's plasma. Um, I truly have to admit that everything I'm saying here is totally speculative and it may may be a load of cobblers. We have no idea. Um, I just wish that um, good science could shed more light on this and uh, I hope eventually it will.  Okay, Russ, you mentioned the name Spock in there and I think that that's the name of a character from Star Trek. If I'm wrong, please do not eat me alive in the comments.  How could you not know that? I mean, it's logical.",

    "question": "I guess I [laughter] should have said, \"Please don't leave me alive, Ross.\" Um, but our last question connects to that. If Ross was in Star Trek Starfleet, which decision would he see himself in, command, engineering, security, or science?",
    "answer": "I'm sorry. I'm big-headed enough and I I like what Captain Kirk had. I he he he not only commanded, he always I mean it was always ridiculous to me as someone who knows how the commander of a vessel has to be protected uh because they're meant to be the brains and the boss. It was always hilarious to me that Jim Kirk was always the guy who got captured by the aliens and he was always falling in love with all the alien women uh because he was the guy who was the point man for the whole ship. All of these young sailors on board the Enterprise were basically left behind and it was Jim Kirk and um Scotty and Spock that basically went down to the ground and did all the hard work on the ground. A little bit implausible, but frankly I want Kirk's job.  So if you're Kirk, what does that make me your producer? [laughter]  You could be um Uhuru. Uh is it Uhhuru the um the the the command navigator? Uhura. Okay. So, that's what we'll say now because usually when when you and I  super super smart woman who knew exactly what she was doing and constantly saved us all from idiocy. How does that sound? [laughter]  So, we this is what we'll call it now because usually when you and I do things like live feeds, we say we're going to do the Payton and Eli playbook, but now I'm going to say the Kirk and her hira playbook. It'll be a little internal thing for us from now on.  Sounds Sounds good to me. You know, it's really interesting. Um, Gene Rodenbury, who wrote Star Trek, there's a lot of speculation. I think he was a navigator in World War II, but it turns out he had some very influential friends who were working inside what now passes, I suspect, for the legacy UAP program. He was very connected and I a lot of people have suggested to me that Gene Rodenbury's ideas of the prime directive which is one of the ideas in Star Trek that Kirk and his team could never show themselves to an alien civilization because to do so would be to interfere in the affairs of a developing civilization. And so the idea was there was this prime directive that you you do not uh bring in highly advanced technology. you allow civilizations to develop under their own steam. And I've always thought it was very interesting that Gene Rodenbury, the the um creator of Star Trek, was very much the progenitor of that idea. And who informed that idea? Can that explain why if there is a non-human intelligence, it's not engaging with us more overtly? I suspect it is.  Okay, Ross, that was the last one for today. Thank you.  Oh, great.
