Hello and welcome to Reality Check. I'm
Ross Kulart, or should I say welcome to
the end, the official end of what was
meant to have been Alien Invasion Day.
Yes, for weeks now on the internet,
there's been speculation that there was
going to be some kind of alien invasion
based on a prediction that 39 days from
the uh interview between President Elect
Donald Trump and Joe Rogan uh there was
going to be some kind of conflict
between humans and aliens. Well, for all
we know, that might actually be
happening because whilst we're talking,
there is over the skies of the world the
most extraordinary display of something,
objects in our skies, the frequency of
which I've never had reported to me to
such an extent before. It's off the
charts. It's absolutely amazing to be
receiving reports as I am hourly,
minutes by minute from people in
countries all over the world who are
saying that they are seeing objects,
strange objects, glowing luminous orbs,
orange orbs, blue triangular shaped
objects hovering over often sensitive
military facilities. Now, of course, the
the biggest area of reports has been in
the United Kingdom in recent weeks, and
we know that over some of the most
sensitive bases in the UK, RAF Lake
Heath, RAF Feltwell, bases where the
United States allegedly stores nuclear
weapons. There have been sightings of
strange dronelike craft for some time
now. Why do I say dron-like craft? Well,
I only say that because intelligence
community sources have been in my ear
for some time assuring me that these are
not aliens. They're not unidentified
anomalous phenomena. They are
reportedly, according to intelligence
insiders, known foreign adversarial
drones. They must be highly advanced
drones based on what I'm hearing. But
the claim is that they are foreign
adverse drones. foreign adversarial
nation drones. Now, I'll be honest with
you. I don't necessarily believe
everything I'm told by members of the
intelligence community, and I think
we're entitled to be skeptical in this
case, not least because we know from
intercepted military communications
before they were digitized and encrypted
when they realized their comms were
being monitored. Some of the clever sky
watchers around RAF bases in the United
Kingdom picked up on the fact that at
least one pilot was referring to UAPs,
not drones. So, if the pilots themselves
that are being sent up to intercept
these objects perceive them as
unidentified anomalous phenomena, not
drones, what aren't we being told? And
that's the bigger issue here. As Ryan
Graves from Americans for a Safe
Aerospace has told us repeatedly, he's
the former pilot who was involved in the
extraordinary spate of sightings off the
east coast involving deployments in
training exercises where they witnessed
weird anomalous objects. He's been
warning for a while that we need to know
for sure that our aerospace is safe. And
at the moment the US government quite
transparently and neither can the
British government nor my country the
Australian government give that
assurance in the face of what we are
seeing in our skies for 2 weeks plus now
I think it's up to 16 17 days there have
been sightings of craft of some kind.
Some of them apparently do have an audio
signature that is consistent with some
kind of propeller or helicopter blade.
They're not jet turbine, but they are
hovering in some cases for many, many
hours at an end. Basically continuing to
hover over very sensitive military
facilities with apparent impunity. Now,
whatever you say about whether these are
UAPs or drones, that's an issue. That's
a national security concern. And some of
the people in the national security
complex would basically say that's a
threat because until we know what they
are, until we know what they are, they
are by definition a threat. And so
whilst people often get accused of
pushing a threat narrative about
unidentified objects, that's what
they're talking about here. And I think
that's the big issue here that a lot of
people including most of the mainstream
media are missing. Let let's compare
what happened in February last year in
2023.
One Chinese spy balloon set the entire
US media and the Congress into
hystericss. They went off their rocker
with concern about this unwarranted
intrusion into American aerospace. And
we still don't know what the remaining
three objects were that were shot down
over I think um there was Alaska. Uh
then there was uh the Yukon and then
there were two parts of the uh the
United States, the main continental
United States. But there's still a
mystery over three of those objects.
What the hell were they? We still don't
know. Has the media been inquisitive
about it? Not at all. And that's the
issue here. Why was there a halaloo and
a big alert and concern about those
objects and not these current objects
that are still hovering with impunity
over some of the most sensitive military
facilities on the planet and right now
we are teetering sadly on the edge of a
third world war. It's not an
overstatement to say that we are in very
dangerous times. And I I suspect that
this is the real backdrop to why we're
not being told what's going on. I think
the US knows full well what these
objects are. Be they foreign adversary
drones or UAPs. I still think that's a
possibility. But if it is a foreign
adversary drone and they're operating
with impunity over our airspace, over
sensitive military facilities, not only
is that a national security concern, for
the United States and for the United
Kingdom to directly accuse, say, Russia
or China, which I'm told is more likely,
to say that China has been deploying
drones over sensitive British air bases,
is tantamount to accusing China of an
act of war and that's why we don't want
to identify that's what I'm being told
at least that's why we don't want to
identify the foreign adversary nation
that we suspect is involved in this some
people are suggesting it's Russian but
my friends from Polish intelligence tell
me they doubt the Russians have anything
like this kind of drone technology which
appears to be able to intercept jet uh
to avoid intercepting jet fighters
there's a great image I I honestly can't
vouch for its authenticity but there's
There's a great video of what is alleged
by one of the sky watchers to be an F-16
fighter approaching one of these
luminous orbs at high altitude and you
see the orb
zoom off in the face of the advancing
F-16 jet. So are these drones, if they
are drones, really faster than F-16
jets? Because if that's the case, it
means there's a genuine issue of
national security concern here. Because
these objects don't appear to have the
kind of propulsion systems we're used to
for drones, and they seem to be
displaying full lights. They're showing
in many cases what some people describe
as navigation lights, but which one
source of mind is suggesting might in
fact be
sensors, perhaps some kind of
intelligence uh surveillance
reconnaissance sensor that's being used
over these sensitive bases? Is it a
coincidence that just a few months ago
we were told that the United States
would be forward deploying nuclear
weapons because of the heightening
tensions with Russia into some of these
UK bases?
Is that why a potential foreign
adversary? Or maybe something stranger,
something more anomalous is now taking a
close interest in these bases? We simply
don't know. But I I can tell you the
conspicuous thing is the absence of any
comment by either the United States or
the British Royal Air Force. It's like
they've decided to clam up. And that's
concerning. There there are reports, for
example, that the SAS, the Special Air
Service and the Special Boat Service,
two of Britain's most elite military
regiments, have been deployed around
some of these bases to try and capture
the suspected
um criminal enterprises that are
launching these drones from adjacent
forests. But if that's the case, why
haven't we caught any? And add to that
that what we're seeing at the moment is
a spate of drone sightings not just in
the United Kingdom or supposed drone
sightings. We're seeing anomalous
objects, strange unidentified objects
over countries all over the world. My
inbox has exploded in the last few days.
I'm getting messages from Russia,
Kazakhstan, China, across Southeast
Asia, Japan, where people are reporting
to me sightings of anomalous strange
objects that the governments are calling
drones in some cases, but which are not
explainable as known drones. And so, the
big issue is what the hell are they? And
we just simply don't know. That's a
concern. Here's one for example. Um we
were told that the British aircraft
carrier HMS Elizabeth in Germany um on
the 22nd of November there was a
security incident at the port of Hamburg
when the Queen Elizabeth was docked
under heavy protection. The German armed
forces had a secure military zone around
the vessel with um homeland security
forces and they reported a suspicious
sighting of a 1.5 m by 1.5 m
reconnaissance drone hovering over the
284 m long aircraft carrier. Um they
likely uh they confirmed the incident
the Bundesphere and identified the drone
as likely engaged in espionage
activities. They deployed, and this is
the crucial thing, they deployed what's
called HP47 jamming equipment, capable
of emitting signals to disrupt and
neutralize drones by forcing them to
either land or return to their
operators. But that attempt to intercept
the drone was unsuccessful.
So the bottom line is whoever it is
that's operating these craft, these
objects over very sensitive military
facilities, not just in the UK, but also
clearly in Europe, Germany, and in
multiple other countries around the
world, including continuing reports in
the continental USA. The people that are
doing this are not being caught. They're
operating with obvious impunity. And
moreover, the technology that they are
using is not susceptible to the known
drone interdiction technology, which
normally in involves firing um a signal
at the craft and intercepting the signal
that disrupts the uh operator's control
of that drone.
One thing that I am told is that we
cannot use broadspectctrum high pulse
microwave weapons on these objects over
sensitive military airspace and that's
because obviously there are fighter
aircraft and other aircraft operating in
the vicinity. One thing I know, and
interestingly enough, I know this from
people who tell me that HPMs, these h
high pulse microwaves have been used
against known nonhuman technology. One
of the risks in deploying these weapons
is that if you fire them in the vicinity
of a UAP, you knock out every aircraft
in the vicinity. And so, you can't do
that over sensitive military airspace
when you've got your own fighters in the
air. But that doesn't explain a a lot to
me because I know for example there's a
company that's just set up. It's a US
company called Anderil A N D U R I L.
They have fantastic anti- drone
technology and including something
called the Fury which uh if you look on
their website demonstrates a capacity to
extremely high speed knock out
individual drones or UAS's that are
intercepted inside sensitive military
airspace. That's what these are
purposebuilt for. Your governments and
mine have funded these anti- drone,
anti-US operations at a cost of many
hundreds of millions, if not billions of
dollars over the last few years. And I
think we're entitled to ask, why the
hell isn't it working? If these
so-called drones are attempted to be
being intercepted by the Americans andor
the British and we know that the British
army has deployed special elite units
that are meant to be involved in counter
drone efforts, why haven't we seen one
brought down? There is, I admit, one
report by a local woman that says that
she's aware that a drone was brought
down, I think, over Raph Laken Heath,
RAF based Laken Heath, but if that's the
case, we've seen no official
confirmation of that. And it could very
well be that the reason why they're not
confirming it is because they don't want
to essentially put themselves in a
declaration of war with whatever the
foreign nation is that was responsible
for deploying this technology. Because
the moment that you do identify that
foreign adversary nation, you are
essentially declaring that they have
committed an act of war against your
nation. And with n with national
sensitivities the way they are at the
moment, the last thing I think either
Britain or the US want to do is
precipitate any kind of confrontation
with Russia or China. Could it be
perhaps that China has de developed
technologies that are far in advance of
what the Russians have and that what
they are trying to do is provoke a
conflict between the Russians and the
Western world? Is that possible? Would
they do such a dastardly thing?
Certainly, it's being suggested to me
that these drones, if that's what they
are, are more likely Chinese than
Russian. And apparently we know this
because of the very distinct audio
signatures on these purported craft. Add
to that the fact that don't forget just
a few weeks ago there was a very
extraordinary incident where a Chinese
vessel which is almost certainly linked
to the PLA the um Chinese army uh was
involved in dropping its anchor and
dragging its anchor and snagging and
severing very important internet cables
in and around Scandinavia. Now, that
incident still is largely unreported.
It's an effective active war by what we
suspect is a Chinese army vessel
controlled at least by one crew member
who is Russian. Why has there not been
any attempt to board that boat? And I
suspect the answer is because we don't
want to provoke international tensions
any more than they are at the moment.
So, let's put the drone issue to one
side for a moment.
Let's not ignore the fact that there
clearly is still, separately from the
drone issue, there have been for many
months now, and we've reported on this
in reality check, anomalous objects
clearly identified as anomalous by
pilots and military personnel operating
over very sensitive military facilities,
particularly in the United States. And
one of the um reports that u we did was
reports of anomalous objects being seen
by locals over Langley Air Force Base in
Virginia. And the Air Force of course
has persisted in maintaining that these
are drones. But not one shred of
evidence has been presented to supply
any proof at all that these are drones.
In fact, the Pentagon has conspicuously
failed to provide any proof at all to
back up its claim that these objects are
drones. Um, you might recall a few weeks
ago I did an interview with the um,
Tedesco brothers, John and Jerry
Tedesco, who do a lot of research off
Long Island and they are, I think
probably foremost as technical experts
in an understanding of anomalous objects
that are being seen on very sensitive
air routes in and out of JFK airport
coming into New York. and they're aware
of a lot of the orbs that are now being
seen in and around New Jersey off the
Long Island coast. And they continue to
maintain that these objects are not
drones. They do not comply. They're not
consistent with any known drone
technology. They do move in anomalous
ways. and what they're seeing and
recording on their hyperspectral cameras
and their numerous other sensor systems
that they've paid for themselves.
They're not US government funded. They
are raising a very serious question. And
I I note as this goes to air, it's just
been reported on NBC that the objects
are again being seen over New Jersey
this evening. And that's very
interesting because the FBI is now
involved. The FBI has approached John
and Jerry Tedesco. And I know that they
are taking an interest in the New Jersey
sightings as well. There are some very
sensitive homes under New Jersey,
including I think one associated with
the incoming president. I wonder if
that's just a coincidence. Is somebody
sending a message or something sending a
message? We simply don't know because
our governments aren't telling us. And
more importantly, our media is not
curious enough to continue asking the
question. And that's the issue. The
issue yet again is the failure of much
of the mainstream media to question the
drone assertion. If the Pentagon
spokesperson gets up and says that these
are drones being seen over US and UK and
other countries very sensitive military
facilities over the Queen Elizabeth
aircraft carrier in a dock in Hamburg
and Germany. That's a national security
threat. That's a bigger threat than any
kind of balloon being seen over the
continental USA in February 2023 as we
know. So why isn't it being aggressively
reported and investigated by the media?
Well, because much of the media allows
itself to be tamely led by the nose by
their intelligence sources. They don't
want to burn their sources who are
giving them cozy little stories about
Ukraine, about Russia, and they're
allowing themselves actively to be
misled. the same organizations that
misreported on CO and misreported on the
Iraq war and have misreported on
intelligence issues for much of the last
60 or 70 years. It's time for the public
to start asking questions itself to
start doing our own research, our own
independent investigation. And to that
effect, I want to commend some work done
by an organization called Enigma Labs
with whom I had a very brief flirting
association. I got to know them really
well in their very early days, but
they've done some great work. They've
been investigating the orbs and spheres
that have been seen over the continental
USA. And they made a point of mentioning
that in Arrow's November report, they
showed that orbs and spheres are
frequently reported with most sightings
occurring between 15,000 to 25,000 ft.
And what they went on to report that
they've been speaking regularly with
fighter pilots, active service fighter
pilots at US Air Force bases. And these
men and women are telling Enigma
anecdotally that the sightings of these
metallic looking spheres in particular
are concerningly still continuing often
multiple times a day they're appearing
when they're flying and doing training
exercises. They're saying, again,
consistent with what Arrow told the
Pentagon and told Congress, they're
appearing between 24,000 and 28,000 ft,
which is a lot higher than most
commercial drones. If this is a foreign
adversary actor, it's using technology
far beyond what we know commercial
drones are capable of. Now, we know that
those kind of long range, long-d
distanceance drones exist because the US
has been using such autonomous drones
for a very long time in warfare. But it
does raise the possibility or
probability, if this is a foreign
adversary, that these are extremely
grave incursions. But it gets more
interesting in what Enigma reveals. They
did an analysis on these spheres and
orbs to see what they could learn. and
they discovered that there's been an
incredible number. A total of 6,226
total orb or sphere sightings were ad
were submitted to the Enigma Skywatching
network between December 2022 to
September 2024. So that's just under 2
years, 6,226.
And when they ruled out ones that were a
little bit more uncertain, there were um
4,467
approved or orb sightings that they were
able to confirm were genuine sightings.
But this is the good part. When they
drilled down further, they found 322
metallic orb sightings.
They were metallic, metal, or silver
orbs.
Now, reality check fans will recall that
we've taken a very, very close interest
in these metallic orbs. I've reported on
a guy in Texas who claims that he has a
silver sphere which he has seen
operating and moving under its own
steam. And I've had since then a
ridiculous number of people contact me
from all over the world who tell me that
they've been seeing metallic spheres
across Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa,
India, Australia, and a lot of the
continental USA. But have a listen to
some of this more information from
Enigma because there's been a lot of
metallic spheres reported by military
pilots adjacent to or over very very
sensitive US continental USA military
bases. So, at the Naval Air Station
Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Enigma
reports on the 1st of August 2023, a
metallic sphere was seen flying low,
then disappeared into the sky. Near
Joint Base Lewis McCord in Washington
State in May 2023, a silver gray sphere
flying at low altitude. July 2024, a
3-fft high shiny oval. January 2024, a
silver ball following a plane. Several
sightings also near Eglund Air Force
Base, which we've reported on in
Florida. June the 4th, 2024. Silent
silver orbs in formation.
And again, uh June 12th, silent silver
craft appears after a flash. Now, John
and uh Jerry Tedesco, who we reported on
from Long Island, they got an intriguing
image of what looks like an orb
literally tailing a commercial aircraft
as it either exited or entered JFK
airport on the approaches to New York.
This is a concern. These are objects
operating inside highly sensitive
airspace. God help us if there's a
collision involving one of these objects
and a commercial or military aircraft.
That's why this is an issue. That's why
Ryan Graves, Americans for a Safe
Aerospace is such an important
initiative. And that's why civilian and
military pilots need to start worry stop
worrying about the stigma and start
reporting these objects more. So, it's
to be applauded, frankly, that Enigma is
getting reports like these. And I'd
certainly like to hear from anyone who's
seeing these metallic orbs in
particular. They're very interesting
because they have no visible means of
propulsion. They don't display a heat
signature showing either a propeller or
a jet turbine. Nobody can see a seam on
them. Nobody can explain how these
things propel themselves. But multiple
people are seeing them in our skies. Why
do we continue to ignore this as a
national security issue? We jump up and
down and get hysterical about Chinese
balloons entering American aerospace in
February 2023, but we don't talk about
metallic spheres. Why is the media
allowing itself to be so controlled and
gagged? Why doesn't somebody at the
White House briefings for the president
or the Pentagon briefings develop a
spine or a new pair and actually start
asking questions asking, "Well, hang on
a moment. What is all this? What are
these drones? If you say these are
drones, why do you say they are drones?
What evidence have you got they are
drones? If these are metallic orbs or
spheres being seen by your pilots, and
if you think that's nonsense, why are
you putting pilots in charge of 100
million aircraft if you think they're
lunatics? This is the issue. It's time
for the media to start asking seriously
aggressive and hard questions because we
are we are being misled and lied to.
That's the issue. So, please keep your
sightings coming in. I am overwhelmed.
I'm very very interested to hear more
and um I can tell you there's something
in this but at the moment I'm not ruling
out the likelihood that these are
foreign adversarial drones that have
developed some kind of advanced
technology that is able to operate with
impunity over some of the most sensitive
airspace in the world. If that's the
case it's a huge concern. And it's
actually, frankly, it's a bigger concern
if it's Russia or China than it is if
it's friendly aliens. Because if it was
aliens and if they were malevolent or
ill-disposed, I'm pretty sure they could
have wiped us out a while back. So, what
else are we talking about on Reality
Check this week? Well, as you know, I've
been in Egypt for the last few weeks.
It's been a fascinating journey and I've
got a lot to report and we're preparing
uh a couple of shows which we'll be
going to air in the next few weeks. But
in the interim, I thought it was time
because of the mounting number of
questions I'm getting on my website and
on my YouTube channel, I thought it was
time I started addressing some of the
questions that people have long been
asking. So, let's deal with some of
those, the Q&As's from our audience. The
first one is from at Zski
numeral 1. Do we know if these are
high-tech military drones and UAPs have
flashing lights? And no one is
questioning that. He makes the point.
Absolutely right. Look, we've kind of
addressed that already. Um, we we don't
know if these are high-tech military
drones. Uh, my sources are telling me
they are. I don't necessarily believe
them, and I think we should be
skeptical. Um, I mean, in one of the
cases I've seen, you've seen a F-16 jet
reportedly engaging with what looks like
a luminous orb, and presumably the jet
is operating at um near supersonic
speeds, and that orb was able to
outstrip the speed of that jet
considerably. Explain that please with
known drone technology.
One question that comes up next is from
AUG GGE6760.
Um, one question that is not asked is
who protects and conceals UFO and alien
evidence? Who does this and who carries
on with this suppression in successive
generations? Who heads and operates this
covert and secret organization?
Okay, let me be on the level here and
say that if you'd asked me that question
three or four years ago, I would have
thought you were a raving lunatic, a
tinfoil hat nutter. I now think your
question is entirely reasonable because
I do believe that there is a cabal of
individuals and they are individuals.
They're not departments or entities.
They are individuals, carefully selected
individuals who believe that they are
entrusted with a national secret and
they're determined to keep it even if
it's operating illegally in defiance of
the oversight rules of Congress. I think
the there are people in the US Air Force
who know full well that we are being
visited by a nonhuman intelligence. How
do we explain the statement that was
made by Dr. John Kosowski, the new and
very well spoken for uh incoming
director of Arrow, the all domain
anomaly resolution office, who gave
evidence to Congress in November,
asserting that there is no evidence of
extraterrestrial visitation to planet
Earth. Well, I want to make the point. I
think it's entirely possible that Dr.
John Cosloski is being lied to by people
within the program who know full well
what's going on. And I wouldn't be
surprised if since his November
appearance, Dr. Coslosski has been
apprised of much more interesting
information that perhaps has changed his
perception. And it would be interesting
to see him put under oath and questioned
more rigorously by a Congress that is
now more aggressively pursuing this
subject with its bit between its teeth.
I am told that there are individuals in
the US Air Force who have been
concealing this secret for years. It's
largely driven out of the US Air Force
uh because of the US Air Force's control
of the subject since the 1940s and
indeed probably a lot earlier. Another
thing I've learned very recently is that
it is very very likely that the US has
had possession of non-human technology
since even before 1941 Cape Gerardo and
possibly even before the magenta object
was retrieved by the Italians in the
1930s. I wouldn't be surprised if the US
has had technology since the turn of
last century. Go figure. But what has
happened, I believe, is that there is a
presidential executive action directive.
I think they're called peds. Forgive me
if I've got that acronym wrong. I really
don't care. I'm sure there will be
somebody who will pick me up on it. But
for those of you who were following
Michael Shelonburgger's evidence in the
Congress when he gave evidence under
oath to the Congress in November, he
referred to a program known as
Immaculate Constellation, which it is my
understanding is a very small part of a
whole series of secret codeame programs
that constitute what we would call the
legacy UAP program. But nonetheless,
it's a very significant one. And I am
now aware of who Mr. Shelonburgger's
source is. I realize now I was speaking
to that source many many months ago. I
wish them the best. I will be protecting
their confidentiality. But I can tell
you I can vouch for who they are and I
think the fact that they have come
forward is extraordinarily significant.
But anyway, just to make the point, when
Shelonburgger made the statements under
oath to Congress that he believed that
this immaculate constellation was a
program that was protected by secrecy by
the defense department, it was formally
denied by the Pentagon that Immaculate
Constellation is a special access
program controlled by the Department of
Defense. And you know what?
The Pentagon's spokeswoman was telling
the truth. And I suspect she knows full
well what the real story is. And the
real story I am told very very reliably
is that there is a presidential
order, action directive, whatever you
want to call it, that was signed in or
around 1954 by President Eisenhower that
enshrined the secrecy of the legacy UAP
retrieval and reverse engineering
program.
This has been kept a secret even from
Congress in breach by the way of article
one of the US Constitution which
requires that Congress have oversight of
everything it's paying for. This has
been done in breach of those
congressional oversight rules because of
this somewhat lame and I think
unsupportable presidential order since
the 1950s.
And I think that it's going to be a very
interesting day of reckoning when
Congress finally, if it ever does,
develops the spine to ask the question
of the White House, is there a present
presidential order which has essentially
allowed this issue to be kept secret at
White House level for many, many
decades. And if that's the case, how do
we justify that commanders in chief like
Barack Obama, like Jimmy Carter, like
Bill Clinton, notice they're all
Democrats, asked the hard question, is
there a secret UAP program? And they
were told there wasn't. Certainly Obama
was during his administration, and so
was Clinton, but they found out
differently subsequently. They know they
were being lied to and they were being
lied to because of this ridiculous
presidential executive order. On what
basis, you would ask yourself, and I'd
love a constitutional lawyer to answer
this question, on what basis could a
former president or a previous president
lock in a lie to all futures commander
and chief to stop them from being
briefed into this program? On what basis
was that a good idea? Last time I
checked, America is a democracy
nominally. On what basis could a
commanderin-chief requesting information
about the UAP legacy program be denied
that information? And that's what I'm
alleging happened and continues to
happen. Presidents have been lied to.
Congress has been lied to. That should
be an issue for the American public. And
by the way, the American public should
be asking themselves,
what about the JFK assassination?
Is there a link between the UAP issue
and JFK's murder by the National
Security State, which I'm in no doubt
happened? I do not for one moment
believe that Lee Harvey Oswald was a
lone assassin. And multiple sources in
the intelligence community tell me I'm
right. I think when we resolve the issue
of UAPs, when we blow open the JFK
files, I think we're going to solve both
mysteries.
Okay, moving on.
Next question
at D A R K at Dark982. Question from Mr.
Coulter. What is your take on why the
NHI do not just reveal themselves? Do
you agree with the idea that there is an
agreement for delayed or complete
non-disclosure?
Because if true, I would find that to be
somewhat confusing behavior on behalf of
the NHI. I also think that if they were
waiting for us to be ready that maybe we
wouldn't be seeing them in our skies or
maybe at all. Thanks for the work you do
and hoping to hear your thoughts. Okay,
Mr. Dark. Um,
I think there's a really interesting
explanation that I'm beginning to
hypothesize. This is only a speculative
hypothesis on my part, but it is based
on work that I am doing that is
increasingly focusing on what I believe
is a consciousness connection to the UAP
phenomenon. I do think that there is a
link between what we call psychic
phenomena, telepathy or psionics as is
the more neutral term that's used by the
military and the defense community. I do
believe that there is a connection
between human psionic abilities,
telepathic psychic abilities and
consciousness and that the UAP
phenomenon is tied into that. And I
suspect this is one of the largest
reasons for why this is being kept
secret and for why the NHI are not
overtly showing themselves. and my
growing hypothesis. It's just a
hypothesis because I've there's a few
things I can't tell you right now that
I'm going to be reporting on in coming
weeks. And I'm very excited to be
bringing you that story. But I do know
that the Air Force has been working on
psionics for many, many decades. They
never stopped investigating the power of
the human mind and consciousness ever
since the Stargate program and the
remote viewing program. I know it's been
poo pooed. I know there's a George
Clooney movie based on John Ronson's
book called The Men Who Stare at Goats.
And I know all the supposed debunkers
say it's BS, but I can tell you it's not
BS. I've seen it for myself and it's
real. And in fourthcoming weeks, you
will see why I say it's real.
And I believe the United States Air
Force has knowingly deceived Congress,
successive presidents, and the American
public, and the world about what it
knows for far too long. It's time for
this story to be told. Now, coming back
to the question from Mr. to arc.
I think the NHI are showing themselves
in our skies to twig our consciousness
to make us humans aware of capabilities
that many of us don't even realize we
have. And I've seen those capabilities
demonstrated in recent months. I know
they're real and I frankly don't give a
flying fig what the debunkers or the
skeptics or the trolls would say about
that. It's real and they will soon be
eating humble pie.
The capacity for the human mind to
engage externally
with some kind of uber consciousness has
been speculated about in science. Go and
have a look at the the work on
microtubules.
Let's have a look at what modern science
is speculating about a quantum
connection between the human brain and
an external consciousness.
That's where we're going in this. So,
what if UAPs are merely a manifestation
of something that is above and around
us, a consciousness? Some might call it
God. Yeah, I know this is heavy stuff.
But what if the purpose of its
engagement with the human race is to
slowly twig our awareness and to
encourage us to use abilities that we
don't even know we have? I'm very
interested in hearing from people who
were part of the gate program
20 to 30 years ago who found themselves
in rooms with US Air Force officers and
strange psychologists in white lab coats
showing them on occasion strange
apparently nonhuman objects. Yes, this
has been happening. Young kids,
pre-pubertal kids have been misused in
experimentation by our military in
experiments designed to develop an
understanding of how to engage with the
phenomenon with a consciousness. And I
think at the same time that NHI
consciousness is trying to engage with
humanity
individually. I've spoken to so many
people. I had a a message this morning
from one person who's an ex very senior
US Air Force person working in a very
sensitive area who told me that they had
psychical abilities and they'd never
spoken about it. But when they told me
about their sighting of a gigantic
craft, I said to them, "By any chance,
do you have psychic abilities? Have you
ever had a intuition or a precognition?"
And they said they were very moved by my
question because they'd never really
spoken about it, but yes, they have. And
everybody I talk to tells me about
intuition, precognition, some kind of
second sight, some kind of insight that
gives them an ability to understand or
engage with things in a way that humans
can't quite understand. And I think
that's what lies behind our
understanding or our growing
understanding of the phenomenon.
I think that if these are craft, if they
are craft at all, they are a
manifestation of a consciousness that is
trying to engage with humanity. Um, and
I think interestingly enough, the
evidence that I am acquiring suggests
that the craft can only be operated by
people with those psionic abilities.
Watch this space. More to come on this.
Now, the other question from Mr. dark
was are there agreements and are those
agreements perhaps constraining why and
what we can be told now that's a good
question um as you know if you were a
watcher of the interview I did with
David Grush back in June 2023
David Grush to a very limited extent
referred into what he was allowed to
reveal through his DOPSA his defense
office pre-publication security review
he referred to unspecified agreements
Now, I've been investigating that and I
do believe it's possible, plausible. I
haven't confirmed it that sections of
the US military concluded agreements
with a nonhuman intelligence. And I
wouldn't be surprised at all if there
was an agreement of nondisclosure.
Perhaps some kind of Star Trek like
prime directive where the NHI didn't
want humanity informed. wouldn't be
surprised at all if that was the case. I
haven't had it explicitly said to me,
but I have had multiple sources refer to
agreements.
Okay, so let's just examine that.
Firstly, if such an agreement was made,
how could it possibly be legal? How
could the whole planet be bound by an
agreement that a bunch of jumped up,
hubristic, arrogant men in the 1950s or
the 1940s concluded with a non-human
intelligence? Why would they have any
right to make a decision on humanity's
behalf? And moreover, if the Congress
and certain presidents were not properly
informed, as I am confident they were
not, and in complete breach of article
one of the US Constitution, then those
officers of the US Air Force are in
serious breach of their oath to the US
Constitution, which is an act of
treason.
Treason. That's what we're talking about
here.
So, if these people are aware that
people like myself and others are on
their tail and that disclosure is
imminent, that Congress is now getting
close. If I was you guys, I would be
thinking very seriously about coming
forward because you are going to face
treason charges if your government
doesn't decide to exonerate you or put
you before a truth and reconciliation
commission where you are given immunity
in return for telling the truth.
You face the very grave probability of
criminal charges. And yes, I do think
there are people who should be going to
jail as a result of what I've learned
about the legacy program.
Experimentation on children,
murder, intimidation,
bullying, threats. Not a good look,
guys.
Okay, moving on.
The next question is from Johnny M6338.
This is a long one, but it's a good one.
Ross, while I can understand and agree
with the need to keep the technology
portion of the information secure for
obvious reasons, why is it necessary to
overclassify the NHI biolog biological
materials and the scientific information
classified? That information is
essential to advancing our understanding
of astrobiology. That's essentially
blocking our scientific advancement,
which I don't believe any government has
the right to do. And I can't see how
releasing such information and samples
to the research community can in any way
jeopardize national security. Can you? I
mean, come on. We know they have these
materials. Yes, we do. And they know
that. We know that they do. So why would
any government, let alone our own,
deliberately withhold scientific
research advancement? Now, look, this
question goes on and on and on. It's
about 2,000 words, but I can answer it.
Um, I completely agree with you. I can
tell you uh Johnny that um I am in touch
with scientists inside the legacy UAP
retrieval program that is a program that
has retrieved nonhuman craft alien
spacecraft and that these people are
deeply frustrated that they cannot share
their science with other scientists and
with humanity in general. They also
think it is immoral that we do not know
and that the Pentagon and the US
government choose to lie to us. Um what
they want is for their science to be
shared with other scientists so that we
can achieve breakthroughs that allow the
materials science study of these objects
to get a breakthrough. Because my
understanding is that when they've
actually looked at these craft the
technology within them has often
defeated materials science. It's an
assembly at the atomic level of which we
are not yet capable. That's the issue.
But what we have learned is the ability
to psionically engage with non-human
technology and operate it to our own
advantage.
The fear that has been expressed to me
by scientists is that as h happens all
too often, America, Russia, and China
are all involved in a quiet cold war, as
David Grush admitted to me last year,
competing to develop these technologies
for military advantage. Now, I don't
want to condemn the military people that
are doing this. That's the way they
think. You know, when this was first
discovered and when the realization was
first achieved that we had technologies
that were far beyond known human
science, it was during the Cold War and
it was realized that the best way of
securing an advantage over our foreign
adversaries was to essentially develop
those technologies in secret. But I know
because I'm talking to people who know
all about it, the Russians have their
own reverse engineering program going
with their own retrieved technology and
so do the Chinese. And what is driving a
lot of the Bellico's rantings from the
American military at the moment towards
the Chinese is that the Chinese, I
suspect, are far more advanced than the
Americans in their development of the
material science technology. Oh, and
could this have something to do with the
foreign adversary drones hovering over
the United Kingdom and the United States
sensitive military facilities? Just
maybe it could. Have a close look at
some of those objects that have been
videoed in recent days that appear to
show blue plasmatic glows. Leave it with
you. So yes, I do think it's
unjustifiable that either the technology
or the biologics are being withheld from
the public and particularly from
science. But and again I can just hear
the outraged bellose ranters online
accusing me of covering up for the dark
state. Um the simple fact is I do think
that there are technologies that lie
behind this that ought properly be kept
secret. Just like with nuclear weapons,
I don't want to know. I shouldn't know
how to make a thermonuclear bomb. I
don't want to know how to make
scalar weapons. Remember that term
scalar weapons. Wouldn't that be
terrible if what apparently is the
subject of fictional speculation was in
fact real? And wouldn't it be terrible
if at least two of the nations on this
planet that constitute semi superpowers
so-called were in possession of such
scalar weapons? Wouldn't that be a
threat to humanity? And wouldn't it be
terrible if our first contact with a
non-human intelligence was to
essentially malign the technologies of
theirs that we've discovered for
developing an adversarial advantage over
foreign countries. That's the issue that
lies behind, I think, a lot of the
secrecy.
Johnny M6338
that is explaining why this is being
kept quiet. I hope that's a sufficient
answer to your incredibly detailed
question.
Okay, so uh kin tanch2601, I have two
questions. One, with all the advances in
photography technology, why can't we get
a good closeup of any of these UAPs?
And two, did they send any jets up to
intercept these unknowns? I don't
believe they were drones. I believe the
pilots say what they saw. And you're
dead right, Ken. We know because we've
heard the communications at least one of
the pilots described what he was seeing
as UAPs, unidentified anomalous
phenomena. So why does the US Air Force
and the British Air Force continue to
maintain that these are mere drones?
Perhaps they are drones, but whatever
they are, they represent an advancement
in technology that is far beyond what
we've known publicly to date. And that's
an issue of concern. Now, why do these
objects not show up clearly in
photographs? I think that was your first
question. I think one of the
explanations that's been offered to me
is that the very nature of the
propulsion system that these objects are
using, these craft are using, involves a
plasma, a distorting plasma that
actually glows around the object. That's
why you'll often see a blue plasma glow
around these spheres, orbs, triangles,
or discs. Apparently, that plasmatic
glow is the object flitting in and out
of spaceime,
which might explain why they are often
translucent or sort of semi-visible.
Um, uh, did they send any of their jets
up to intercept these unknowns? Yes,
they did. We know that they did because
we've seen videos of it from um sky
watchers in the United Kingdom. And
thank you very very much to those
stalwart people that have been going out
night overnight for the 16 plus days of
sightings over the United Kingdom who've
been capturing intriguing images of
objects being engaged with by her
majesty's jets and the jets of the US
Air Force.
Okay,
next question is
Thomas Boomer 9809. Bravo Ross, well
done, sir. Could you possibly visit
Skinwalker Ranch in the future? Oh boy,
I'd love to visit Skinwalker Ranch. And
for those of you who've watched Reality
Check in the past, you would know that
we interviewed Brendan Fugle a few
months ago and Brandon very kindly
extended an invitation to me and
NewsNation and Reality Check to come and
film at Skinwalker Ranch. And I will be
doing so. I would love to do so. I just
have to find the time to do it in
between dealing with tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands of emails. It's
just insane right now with all these
sightings off the charts.
I'm also very interested in areas like
Skinwalker Ranch outside of Utah. I
mean, Skinwalker is a fascinating
location, but I know it's not the only
one. I'm doing a documentary which will
be going to air on NewsNation and
hopefully the CW network in coming
months which will be exploring at least
one other site in the United States
which involves extraordinary anomalous
activity and possible interdimensional
portals. And I think there are sites
like this all over the world, including
here in Australia. And if anyone knows
about any of these, I'd love to hear
from you. I'm really interested in
hearing more about interdimensional
portals. You can get hold of me on my
Twitter site. There's a an email listed
there, mukraker, mu c k a k r at
protonmmail.com.
If you know anything about any of these
interdimensional sites where anomalous
activity is being seen, particularly
where there is a heavy military
presence, and I'm told there are often
heavy military presences around these
sites, I'd love to hear from you.
Okay. Uh Paul Fogerty Songs asks, "Hi
Ross, we've corresponded once before. I
wonder if you've looked at the
phenomenon of religion and compared its
acceptance by so many around the world
and yet UAP is treated in a totally
opposite way. Love to hear your
thoughts. Thanks Paul. Well, yeah, I
mean we have done reality check episodes
on this, notably with a theologian
called Paul Thigpen talking about
excerpts from the Bible and other
religious texts which do appear to refer
to things that I certainly interpret,
Paul doesn't necessarily, as UAP. uh
Paul takes a very literal interpretation
that these are angels and demons and who
knows he might be right. Certainly there
are people in the air force of very
evangelical Christian bent who think
that the phenomenon ought not to be
being investigated because it does
involve angels or demons. Um I don't
know. I simply don't know. What I don't
like though is the notion that a
religion would tell us that we're not
allowed to investigate. Anything that
assumes blind faith is totally
antithetical to good science. And I'm
sorry if that puts me in contradiction
with people of religious faith, but I'm
sorry. I just think we should question.
We should always ask. And if a religion
was to punish us for asking a question,
then there's something wrong with that
religion. I never as a child accepted
the idea that we should unquestioningly
show faith in the notion of a Christian
God and all of the ideas that went with
that. I used to get into terrible
trouble with my divinity teachers for
asking questions. And I don't see why we
should. Any good religion and any
compassionate god, if a god exists,
would surely understand that humans have
a right to ask questions.
Um, one of the other questions I've got
here is from CB Barry 4068. I'd ask,
"What's the best proof of Bigfoot or the
best evidence? I've looked for it and I
can't see any. It's not as though I'm
not open-minded to it. I just don't see
what others do." That's a good question,
Barry. I'm not necessarily a Bigfoot
believer, but I'm also not necessarily a
Bigfoot disbeliever. Coming back to a
moment to the idea of interdimensional
portals. One idea I've flirted with from
speaking to people like Brandon Fugal
and others who've worked in the NIDS and
ORAP investigations at Skinwalker Ranch
is that there do appear to have been
anomalous creatures, entities emerge
from apparent portals on that ranch that
were seen by reputable scientists. you
know, non-loopy individuals and that
these objects and entities did appear to
correspond to what we would call
Bigfoots. Is it possible that there is a
Bigfoot that essentially emerges from
interdimensional portals and comes into
our area to collect food or or game or
minerals of some kind? I have no idea,
but I wouldn't exclude that possibility.
Science is incre increasingly suggesting
that such portals do exist. We know that
black holes exist. Why is the idea of an
interdimensional portal something that
is so antithetical to good science?
Certainly, if you have a look at the
ancient Aboriginal rock paintings or the
rock art of indigenous Native Americans,
it's quite clear that they were
describing things that I would certainly
describe as portals. And I've had the
privilege of speaking to people of
Native American background and they
certainly describe portals existing
today. So I wouldn't rule out the
possibility of Bigfoot. It's just that
like you I haven't seen the evidence.
Okay, last couple of questions. Uh at
Wilhelm Hess 1348, is it just nuclear
weapons or nuclear atomic energy plants?
Reports have been made of hundreds of
UAP sightings at atomic energy plants.
Yep, you're quite right, Wilhelm. We are
not talking about UAPs just being seen
over nuclear weapons facilities like
Malmstrom Air Force Base as uh was
reported by numerous US Air Force former
personnel. We're talking about multiple
sightings often over the same facility,
repeatedly reported over many, many
years by staff at these facilities,
including power plants. And I commend
once again to people the fantastic book
by my friend and colleague Robert
Hastings, UFOs and Nukes. It's a
fantastic read. We interviewed Robert a
few months ago on Reality Check. He also
very kindly gave us the link to his
documentary that's linked on his show
and you will see there that he has
extensively reported the extraordinary
frequency of these anomalous objects
over almost every nuclear linked
facility in the United States. And I can
tell you because I'm in receipt of
information from countries like India,
Pakistan, France, Britain, China, there
are equally objects of an anomalous
nature being seen over nuclear
facilities in those countries as well.
It's not a uniquely US phenomenon.
Perhaps it's more reported and perhaps
more authoritarian countries make it
harder for their citizens to come
forward to talk about it, but it's
certainly happening all over the world.
Last question.
Uh
be
b nei
published, posted, shared, or otherwise
made public the tracings he made from
the crashed craft photos? It's been 45
years since he made the drawings. cuz
I'm wondering who else has seen them.
Okay, so what he's referring to there is
my friend and dear colleague Danny
Shien, Daniel Shien, a civil rights
attorney of Renown, who heads the
Paradigm
uh new paradigm institute out of
Washington DC, which is a lobby group
for UAP Transparency that he works on
with Jim Garrison and Tyler Zeratnik.
And they're doing a sterling job
exposing the UFO coverup, which is a UFO
coverup. And what Danny's referring to
there is a seinal incident which
happened to him as a young lawyer. He
had an association uh because of his
background working with the Jesuits and
the Vatican church. Um he was known to
the White House as somebody uh with
connections to the Vatican. And because
of that, perhaps he was approached by a
woman called Marcia Smith, who was with
the Congressional Research Service,
which had been tasked by Presidentelect
Jimmy Carter, to investigate the UAP
phenomenon. It's a great story. I
suggest you read about it in my book or
watch one of Danny's interviews about it
online, including the one I did with
Danny many months ago. What you'll find
is that Danny tells the story of how he
was briefed into the fact that George
Bush senior before he became president
when he was the director of the CIA was
apparently one of the gatekeepers of the
legacy program secrets. And when Jimmy
Carter as presidentele before he was
inaugurated was um asking for a briefing
on UAPs, he was formally refused a
briefing by George Bush Senior. This
isn't something that George Bush Senior
in his lifetime ever denied. It's never
been denied by anybody. I've given
plenty of people connected with him an
opportunity to deny it. It's a
fascinating story. Marcia Smith won't
comment, but Danny Shien says that
eventually he was approached by Marcia
because of his work that he'd done with
NASA
and he was asked to help her investigate
the UAP phenomenon. He asked for access
to the Blue Book Files, the Hidden
Project Blue Book Files. And incredibly,
on a quiet Saturday morning uh on a
holiday weekend in America, he was told
to go to an uncompleted um office of the
National Archives or the Library of
Congress, the Madison building as it's
now known. And there in an uncompleted
basement, he was met by men in black
suits and given access to archives of
microfish. And when he searched those
microfish in impatience he started
looking through the voluminous files for
any kind of photograph. And what he saw
was a photograph of a craft which had
strange markings on the side. And
although Danny hadn't been allowed to
take in a pen and paper, he'd sneaked
one in and he surreptitiously traced
those symbols onto the back of his
shorthand pad and sneaked it out past
the men in black. Now, incredibly and
frustratingly, and I've badgered Danny
to death about this, he lost the
tracings. He lost the tracings. So the
reason why he can't say what they mean
after 45 plus years is because he just
doesn't know. He's never been able to
recover the tracings. But what is
interesting is that when he did his
recollection of those tracings, what he
drew bore a very close resemblance to
the symbols described by an airman
called Jim Penniston, who said that this
was what he saw on the side of a similar
craft at the Raft Bentwaters base
Christmas 1980, which is another story
entirely. I've probably gone on for far
too long. I think we've crossed the
hour. we have. But I hope you enjoyed
this edition of um Reality Check. I'll
try and answer more Q&As's in the future
to come. I can tell you we've got some
very, very interesting programs to come
on my visit to Egypt, and we've got some
sensational stories to rock the new year
with in 2025. I'm looking forward to
seeing President Trump honor his promise
to investigate the deep state because oh
boy there is one and the UAP mystery is
central to it. Crack the deep state you
crack the UAP mystery. It's very very
important if any of you are asking what
you can do. Keep the pressure on your
elected representatives. Let them know
this matters because truth will out and
we'll be here on Reality Check to keep
you informed. Thanks very much.
>> Tonight, a nation on edge.
>> What is going on in New Jersey?
>> That's the question on the minds of
Americans.
>> It was the size of a school bus.
Literally the size of a twocar garage.
as a national security threat looms in
the skies.
>> This is a truly bizarre story and series
of events. Bottom line is that the FBI
is utterly clueless about what is
occurring.
>> Lawmakers fed up with a lack of answers
from the federal government.
>> They're saying no threat to Americans.
>> They're saying no threat, but how the
hell do they know? They don't know
anything. They don't know what it is.
They don't know where it come from.
>> I do think it's ridiculous that they're

comments uh about that.
>> Rich McHugh on the ground as deputies
take action.

>> Hello and welcome to this NewsNation
Prime Time special investigating the
drones mystery. unfolding in our skies.
For months now, there have been mystery
objects hovering over US airspace,
including over sensitive US military
facilities and increasingly over crowded
civilian areas such as New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and other parts across the
continental USA. Tonight, we're going to
try and get answers for you. My name is
Ross Kulhart. I'm based in Australia and
it's part of the reason why we're
telling you this story because it's a
worldwide phenomenon. It's not just
happening in the US. It's happening in
almost every country in the world. And
what's becoming patently clear is the
White House, the FBI, and all of the
investigative agencies have no answers.
So tonight, we're on the ground trying
to get you those answers. Our
correspondent Rich McHugh has been on
the ground in New Jersey all week
talking to people, including gathering
this fiery exchange. I walked out cuz it
it was it was worthless. It was the
biggest amateur hour presentation I've
ever seen about anything. Okay, it was
ridiculous. There were no answers. Uh
every question that was asked by the a
member of the state legislature, great
questions, no answers, no resolution.
They don't know where the drones are
coming from. They don't know who's doing
it. They don't know why they're doing
it. But they say there's no credible
threat. It was annoying to be there.
Here's the most frustrating part. The
Colonel of State Police said that he had
a helicopter of his flying over above
one of these drones, a six-foot drone or
something. I can't remember exactly what
he said. And he just he felt unsafe for
his helicopter. So, he just let it go.
Just let it go. Where'd it go? Who
knows? You know, didn't want to follow
it cuz he didn't feel safe. That is that
not the most ridiculous thing you've
ever heard? It was just excuse after
excuse and we know nothing. It was
infuriating and I got up and I walked
out. You've been in the service, right?
>> Yeah, I was an attack helicopter pilot,
Apache helicopter pilot in the army, and
I helped stand up the initial um uh
unmanned aircraft training battalion in
the aviation sector of the Army. So, I
know a little bit about what I'm talking
about. And these guys are not doing the
job they need to do to figure out what's
going on. And that is the Department of
Homeland Security, the FBI, and the
state police. And Rich McHugh's also
been spending time with local law
enforcement who are searching for
answers and not getting many answers at
all from the federal government.
Thanks, Ross. You know, when this story
first appeared a few weeks ago, as a a
resident of New Jersey and as a
journalist here, I didn't pay it much
attention. I thought it was a bunch of
knuckleheads and this would be all kind
of uh, you know, exposed by now with a
laugh. But the experience I had uh
changed the way I feel about this
completely. The the what we saw was more
sophisticated than I think anything I've
ever seen before. Take a look.
>> One, two, three, four, five, at least
five lights, six lights.
>> I didn't believe what I was seeing, but
what was I seeing? We're here in central
Jersey. We've been looking for the past
hour. I think we've seen about 40 or 50
of these drones. In fact, there's one
over my shoulder right there.
One after another after another, these
drones appeared in the night sky. If you
look real close, they look like
fixedwing aircraft about 8 to 10 ft
wide, colorful, white blinking lights.
>> That is not a plane.
>> Definitely not an airplane. But what was
it?
Hours earlier, I was invited to join the
Ocean County Sheriff's Department.
They launched their own drones to see if
they could intercept the mysterious
aircraft New Jersey residents have been
reporting in recent weeks. The
department says these mystery drones
evade detection because they don't give
off heat like regular drones.
>> Why do you think that is?
>> We don't know. It's just something that
we haven't, you know, it's not something
that we've had our hands on. It's not
something that we've experienced.
>> Something they hadn't experienced until
now. One of their officers called 911
after seeing 50 of them come off the
ocean.
>> Advised after we made contact with that
officer that there were 50 that came off
the ocean.
>> 50
>> 50. That was my reaction also. There
were 50 that were coming off the ocean.
>> And this is a sworn officer.
>> Sworn officer. Yes. We contacted state
police. We contacted the FBI. We
contacted the Coast Guard. At which
point the Coast Guard went out with
their boat and they reported seeing 13
on their boat and then the Coast Guard
also advised that they went over them
about 300 feet and had a wingspan of
about 8 ft.
>> I see one right here.
>> Did I see the same thing that officer
saw? I'm still not sure. What I can show
you is this video. What I can tell you
is I've never seen anything like it
before.
>> Wow.
>> And more than a month since these
reports started, the federal government
doesn't know what they are either.
What's your message to the White House?
>> My message is come to the Jersey Shore.
I know it's winter time, but uh come see
what we see and then, you know, maybe
they'll have a better appreciation for
why our residents are concerned.
>> Now, the Ocean County Sheriff has this
industrial-grade drone they put up. They
said they were tracking one of these
drones, but that drone easily outran
theirs uh and disappeared, which is if
this is not the military, uh then it's
even more terrifying and we need
answers. Now, back to you.
>> We're crossing to Joe Khil, White House
correspondent, and he's there in the
halls of Congress looking for answers.
Ross, if you thought that lawmakers,
both senators and house members on
Capitol Hill, would have more
information than the general public at
home, think again. Yes, they are privy
to classified and private briefings
sometimes, but in this case, they're
telling me they are also being kept in
the dark and don't have any real clarity
here.
>> That's not a plane.
>> What are they? Where are they coming
from? Do they pose a threat? And why
haven't we brought one down yet? All
questions the public might have watching
these drone videos over New Jersey and
part of New York. Questions that even
lawmakers on Capitol Hill who are privy
to classified and sensitive information
are asking too. We see them. We don't
know where they came from or who is
controlling them. What are the rules of
engagement? When when are they perceived
as a threat that can be engaged? Um and
I am seeking clarity on that.
Congressman Adam Smith, the top ranking
Democrat on the House Armed Services
Committee, says he got a private
briefing this week on the situation. But
like dozens of others, NewsNation has
interviewed or spoken to, still has
several outstanding questions about the
nature of these drone sightings.
>> Afternoon everybody.
>> From the White House podium, National
Security Council spokesman Admiral John
Kirby tried to offer some clarity. We
have no evidence at this time that the
reported drone sightings pose a national
security or a public safety threat or
have a foreign nexus.
>> Kirby also said neither the White House
nor local law enforcement have
corroborated any of the sightings
independently, adding some sightings
have turned out to be lawful manned
aircraft rather than mysterious drones.
>> Comments for which he got push back. at
how can you credibly tell people that
there is no public safety threat,
there's no national security threat,
that there's no reason to believe that a
foreign government is involved
>> because the analysis thus far in an
investigation that is ongoing has not
revealed any national security or
malicious intent or criminal activity.
>> No matter what the aircraft are,
lawmakers in both the House and Senate
tell News Nation the focus should shift
to what the Pentagon should do about it.
You've always got to kind of strike the
balance.
>> North Carolina Senator Tom Tillis tells
us, "Of course the military should be
mindful of residential areas, but if the
drones can safely be taken down, they
should be."
>> I personally believe that any drone
that's in the skies uh should be able to
be taken down if there's not some way to
authenticate them. Even a small four or
five pound drone can represent a serious
threat. So, we got to have we've got to
have situational awareness. This week in
a House Armed Services hearing, several
House members pressed officials from the
FBI and National Security Sphere about
why action hasn't already been taken.
>> What if they were carrying chemical
weapons or something? We just don't I
mean, this could be already this could
be a much worse conversation we could be
having right now because these things
have been flying all over New York, New
Jersey, over military installations.
>> I know you have the capability. You've
put out press releases to identify and
bring down drones.
Why can't you deploy them at least to
the ocean? Bring one of these down, find
out who's doing it.
>> In the void of real information from the
White House or the Pentagon, some have
been led to speculate. Congressman Jeff
Van Drew made waves suggesting the
drones came from Iran, only to later
walk it back, saying that's only an
assessment without definitive evidence
from highlevel officials with whom
Vandrew says he has spoken. Here's what
he told us.
>> Highlevel individuals
>> who have top security clearances who say
what they believe it very well may be a
foreign adversary.
>> Not definitively.
>> No, not you have to have proof. We had
to get one. We got to shoot one of these
things down or take it down and find out
what it is they're recording, what
they're doing, how it's made, where it's
from.
>> And several lawmakers are now trying to
get off the sidelines and get more
directly involved in some kind of
response. The new senator from New
Jersey, Andy Kim, actually went along
with police and followed some of these
drones himself, recording them and
saying they are not on the flight
tracker app, meaning they're not manned
aircraft. They are mysterious drones to
which we still don't know an origin.
Ross.
>> Okay. I'm now going to bring in the
mayor of Mine Hill Township in northern
New Jersey, Sam Morris. He's about an
hour's drive from uh downtown New York,
and he's got some very interesting
perspectives on the local concern, the
mounting local concern in and around New
Jersey about these anomalous objects.
Are you seeing any objects? I'm I'm
being careful not to call them drones.
Are you seeing any objects over any
sensitive military facilities in your
area?
>> Uh yeah, we are. We are about 5 miles
from Pikatini Arsenal, which is a
weapons development center uh here in
North Jersey. We're an hour and a half
from uh what used to be called Fort
Dicks um Meguire Air Force Base. And
we're hearing that there are sight there
are sightings of these things over all
the bases. there's no um uh delineation
or respect for those boundaries
whatsoever.
>> Now sir, obviously there's been very
careful statements including
non-statements from the Pentagon on this
so far. I'm I'm incredulous to be
perfectly honest that there's been no
definitive statement from the Pentagon
one way or the other about what they can
tell us once and for all about these
objects. Does that concern you? Does it
concern you that we're just not getting
answers at the moment?
>> That is it. It's not only concerning,
it's the absolute crux of the problem.
Um I I I have a what what started all
this on Sunday was about 25 fellow
mayors of mine and I county decided we
kind of were fed up with no answers. So
we issued a press release. Sunday
morning, we issued a letter to the
governor and legislators and federal
officials on Sunday evening and started
intentionally stirring this up strictly
over the fact that we're getting
nothing. Um, we understand as mayors, we
understand as elected officials, we're
not involved in police or military
operations. We understand that that they
we stay far away from those things
because uh for safety reasons, security
reasons, but to not at least let us know
that they know what is going on. Hey, we
know what's going on, you guys, and
you're going to have to trust us, but
this is not unknown to us. They are
essentially stating it's unknown to them
to the FAA to the uh Homeland Security
and to the Air Force and FBI are saying
we we don't know.
>> The official line consistently from any
of the agencies has been that these are
drones that were led to believe that
potentially these are either um drones
being directed by some unfriendly actor
from a foreign adversary nation. But the
the consistent line has been that we
know that these are drones. Are you
satisfied on the basis of the answers or
the non-answers you're getting from any
of these agencies that they actually
know for sure that these are drones?
>> No, no one is. No elected officials that
I talked to uh you know they're they're
either colleagues or friends or you know
we we all know each other. We try to
work well with each other regardless of
party. None of us know anything. And
while we understand that we have to have
some faith, right? We have to have some
understanding that that the people who
should know these things do know,
they're saying they don't. The FBI is
has put out that they don't they don't
really know what's going on. Um
governor's office um and I take the
governor at his word that he he's also
very frustrated. Um so that is what's
disconcerting. If if I could elaborate,
what's what's upsetting the average
resident and and me personally and
others I know personally is there's
something over our heads physically,
right? And and these things don't weigh
5 ounces. They can weigh up to 300 lb.
And if they lost power and fell on us or
fell on your car windshield driving down
the road or fell on your house from 400
feet, it's coming through your roof,
it's coming through your car, it's
coming through your deck, it's going to
hit you and hurt you uh with good
probability. And yet we're being told we
really have no idea what's going on up
there, but they're supposed to know
what's going on up there. That's their
job. Well, Mayor Sam Morris, we hope we
can help get you some answers, but thank
you so much for talking to Reality Check
and News Nation, and we look forward to
talking to you again. Thank you.
>> Thank you so much.
>> Up next, our favorite civilian
scientists, John and Jerry Tedesco, tell
us what the FBI is telling them they
need to hear. And also, the Hill
correspondent Merrick von Renenamp gives
us a historical perspective on these
unusual objects in our skies.
[Music]
I'd now like to welcome some good
friends of Reality Check, John and Jerry
Tedesco, my favorite citizen scientists.
You'll remember them from a Reality
Check episode a month or so ago where we
brought them on to talk about the
extraordinary work they've been doing
off the coast of Long Island where they
both live. And what they've been doing
is with their own gear that they've
bought at their own huge expense,
they've been observing anomalous
phenomena off the coast of Long Island
ever since, I think about 2 years ago.
John and Jerry, welcome back to Reality
Check. What can you tell us about your
impressions of what's been recorded over
New Jersey in the last few weeks?
>> It's Hello, Russ.
I'm happy to be here.
>> Um, I'll let you go.
>> It's it's it's crazy. Uh many of some of
the uh a good number of the objects are
similar to some of the things we were
seeing off the coast or or like these
these uh uh twinkling lights kind of
rotating lights. Then there's the this
then there's the other mixed bag where
you see um something that resembles
navigation lights. They're drone like
like objects or what appear to look like
drones,
>> right? And the question is is whether or
not it's the same thing whether you know
that all of the stuff that people are
are observing are they are they in fact
two different objects to you know two
different sources of you know uh uh as
far as where they come from or is it uh
or is it or is it the same or is it or
is it um you know maybe a um a US
response to it you know having drone
activity out there drone like
>> so kind of recon or surveillance.
>> Yeah. So, I know you guys, it's a
delicate subject because of course the
the the contact from government agencies
is always slightly covert and discreet,
but I know you guys from our previous
conversations have been approached by
the FBI and that there's an FBI team
that's long been investigating the UAP
sightings in and around uh that part of
America. Um, have you been in touch with
the FBI and Homeland Security in recent
weeks or recent days after these
anomalous strange incidents over New
Jersey?
>> We we have um there there's not
unfortunately there's not a lot, you
know, that we can share publicly.
>> We could say it was it's been
productive.
>> Yeah, but it's been productive and it's
been and there's definitely a genuine
concern out there about about this
stuff.
>> And a representative, a senior
representative of the FBI, Mr. Wheeler
has admitted they don't know what these
objects are.
>> That's
>> which is that's a breathtaking
admission.
>> It's that's very unsettling.
>> Yeah, that's that's that's quite that's
an oddity. That's an oddity.
>> So, one of the other things that you
guys have kindly given to us just in the
last few hours are videos. Can you talk
to the videos that you've included in
what you've sent to us?
>> You want to mention the first video?
Right. So, uh, the the first let me just
pull that up because I we just had we
had just sent it off and I believe the
first video um is a is a dark object um
what we're considering dark objects
because of uh the way they're presenting
uh to uh to our eyes, our hyperspectral
equipment that we're looking at them. Um
there are some objects that can be seen
visibly uh you know and it's uh you know
the colorful lighting uh bright luminous
um presentation. These objects they
can't be seen with the naked eye and in
some cases they can't be seen with night
vision equipment. You have to go deep
within the night vision spectrum in
order to see them. And and we noticed
that um um over the last year uh of
examining and investigating some of
these uh some of these um um aerial
objects, the the uh presentation is very
very difficult even in um even in the
night vision cameras and the night
vision goggles. Um you really got to you
know uh you focus your eyes on them. You
you and it's got to be some degree of
motion. If there's if there's no motion,
you probably wouldn't be able to pick it
out. There's um they seem to be um lack
of a better term I almost like they're
seem to be absorbing light. Um there's
they're not reflecting light at all.
There are some where they come up
they're darker than the rest of the
environment
>> almost like a black body source
>> like a black body source.
>> And so this is what you've captured
presumably with your hyperspectral
camera. Is that right?
>> Exactly. This is with a a near infrared
camera in the night vision cameras. And
I want to mention something else where
John says that it's even difficult to
see some of some of these dark body we
call them dark bodied objects or maybe
it's some kind of black body uh a black
body uh coating on it or something that
that absorbs light doesn't reflect light
very well. uh we were using shortwave
infrared
>> that goes much deeper into the infrared
in order even to even to notice these to
see these right or we and
>> some at times we would uh we had an
object that uh we were focused on in the
sky off the coast of Long Island and
there was another second object sitting
right next to it. We didn't notice it
until we hit it with a uh a high
intensity torch and it actually evaded
the torch, but we didn't even see it in
the near IR. We
>> that that that evasion issue brings me
to something that I think even the New
Jersey governor Murphy has acknowledged.
Um he's he's been quoted as saying the
drones are very sophisticated. He says
the minute you get eyes on them, they go
dark. You're seeing the same thing,
>> right?
>> Yeah. That's Yeah. and and you know
we're trying to understand the statement
that he made you know what aspect of it
that uh it's evading whether or not it's
somebody you know pointing a light up to
it or is it just you know once you're
making contact with these things they
just they just kind of evade uh you know
evade your space you evade your
>> well it's how far how much you're
talking the minute you get eyes on what
does that mean does it mean that they
they that a helicopter approached them
or they shine this a search light on it
even if it goes dark let's say it shuts
it all it lights off this this radar you
could detect them by radar or he could
use a search light. So I mean how dark
what is exactly is he talking about
that's the question right we're seeing
we're seeing the the we're seeing these
object actually change the spectral
range
>> as scientists do you believe that what
you are seeing is potentially evidence
of a nonhuman intelligence
>> yeah I think we have to consider that
it's something that needs to be
considered I mean we have to collect
more data but I mean there's there's
some bizarre features of these objects
or at least the technology is is quite
different from from what we've seen
previously And it certainly doesn't
align with current day technology
>> spectral the changes in spectr spectral
signatures and the the the sudden
appearances and disappearances and some
of the uh some of the uh the flight
behaviors are very strange.
>> I'm looking forward to catching up with
you in person when I get to America next
year. Uh thank you once again for giving
us your insights on the weird weird
sightings over New Jersey.
>> That sounds good Russ. We welcome you
out.
I now want to bring in Marik von
Reninkamp who's a correspondent with the
Hill. He's also got an interesting
background in national security having
worked for the State Department. Let's
cross to Merrick. Now this is a
historical problem, isn't it?
>> Very much so. Um not only does it go
back several years, it goes back
decades. And um you know I've been
looking at some very fascinating old
government records that um I can just
think of one series of incidents that
Jay Ellen Heinik actually wrote about in
his book The UFO Experience. And there
there are some really astounding
government documents that um outline
exactly what we're seeing. Unknown
objects with blinking red, green, white
lights hovering, moving up and down
rapidly over nuclear missile silos um in
Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska. And oh
by the way, that exact same pattern and
series of events occurred in 2000 in
late 2019 and 2020. Um where hundreds
hundreds of people were seeing these
objects. Um
>> this is Oh gosh, I'm so pleased you
mentioned this. So this is the Colorado
swarms. Is that right? The Midwest
swarms.
>> Correct. This is this is really
interesting to me because I've needled
people in the intelligence community
about those so-called swarms which were
seen by police, by military, local TV
reporters and everybody just goes, they
clam up. They won't talk about it. And I
I don't know why. I mean, the
interesting thing is you're saying that
the decades old J. Allen Heinneck
sightings and the Colorado swarms,
they're they're not just similar to,
they're describing objects that are
identical to these objects. Now, if you
look back to emails that um that have
been released through the Freedom of
Information Act, I'm going to quote
directly. Um a Chase County, Nebraska,
this is from 2019 2020. A Chase County,
Nebraska sheriff deputy reported
observing 30 to 50 flying independently
of each other with a larger quote mother
ship hovering for hours directly from
the uh from the memos, from the law
enforcement memos. We'll do one more
just very quickly. Um, in Kansas 2019
2020, a law enforcement officer observed
quote 10 to 15 drones that flew all
kinds of patterns around a stationary
drone. End quote. It flew right over
him. Uh, he had night vision on,
couldn't see it because of the bright
lights. Um, but quote, "It made
absolutely no sound at all even though
the wind was calm." End quote. Um so
that that kind of that similar flight
dynamic that that pattern that we're
seeing um gives me at least moderate
confidence that the objects that we that
were observed in 2019 and 2020 are the
same if not similar to uh what we're
seeing in New Jersey. Now Merrick,
you've been very prominent in commenting
on the growing prepoundonderance of
evidence to suggest that possibility the
possibility that the explanation for at
least some of the anomalous objects that
have been seen over the United States in
the last 70 to 80 years is perhaps
nonhuman.
Are we talking potentially that these
drones might in fact be a non-human
intelligence?
>> Boy, we're we're we're touching the
third rail here. Um, you know, it it's
it's tough to it it's it's tough to
assess, right? Because there are
consistent reports of rotors, fixedwing,
right, noises and and um capabilities
that appear consistent with pretty
standard human technology. Merrick von
Renenamp from The Hill. Thank you so
much for joining us. Coming up, my
colleague and co-host Chris Cuomo had an
interview with some of the biggest names
in this UAP issue. That's next.
[Music]
A lot of these drones, like the ones
we're showing right now, you see
navigation lights on them. You see a red
and a green. Uh, you know, you know this
from from boating and down, you know, so
they have the same things. Aircraft are
the same thing that boats do. They have
a red and a green. So, it's not like
they're from some outer atmosphere. Uh,
let me start with you, Mr. Melon. Uh, do
you believe that there are more and that
it's understood and explainable?
>> I believe there are more. I think it's
important for people to understand that
this has been going on since at least
2017, which is to say these smaller,
brightly lit drone-like vehicles
violating restricted US military
airspace in sensitive areas around
power, nuclear power facilities, nuclear
weapons storage facilities. A year ago
today roughly this was Langley Air Force
Base was taken offline by drones and
that continued for that was exactly a
year ago this month and that was about a
year after there was a similar sort of
pattern in the western United States for
several months near some of our ICBM
fields. So it's troubling that after all
this time we still haven't captured any
of these things. We still haven't
brought them down. We still don't know
where they're coming from. Uh we are
really in a position of ignorance uh
here and hopefully this will maybe at
long last after all these prior events
and the Chinese balloon uh get some
people to take a hard look at what do we
need to do to get our hands on one of
these things so we can get to the bottom
of this.
>> Right.
>> I mean look Chris, you know better than
I do, but I don't know that they haven't
gotten any of them. I would read it
another way. Just as somebody who's been
in the business of deception detection
for 25 years, that you know that
calmness of them being not concerned
about it is usually a function of having
information. And Ryan, you and I have
talked many times about how many uh
stories you've heard about what they did
take down or what they found on the
ground and programs that use a lot of
money to use special operators to go and
recover these things. But SUVsized
drones, I can't find those on the
commercial market. I've been looking for
days. How do you explain that part? You
think people just get the size wrong,
Ryan?
>> Well, you know, there always is some
uncertainty when it comes to judging a
moving object in the sky, especially at
night, and especially as a single source
of light. But these things appear to be
close enough to the ground where I think
I have pretty high confidence in the
size predictions that they're
estimating, give or take 20%. But, you
know, these sizes and these types of
behaviors are something that we've seen
and we've talked about, Chris, over the
years, starting in Virginia Beach,
working its way further north into the
Langley area, and perhaps now into New
Jersey.
>> I don't think we can conclusively say
that they're inherently linked
necessarily, but with the mixed messages
that we're getting between the
legislative branch and between the
executive branch, it really feels like
the Biden administration is gaslighting
us on the seriousness of this issue.
These are bigger, they're more
sophisticated, and they're in places
that are invading people's privacy, and
some of it is sensitive space. What are
you going to do about it?
>> You know, I think that in general, uh,
once President Trump gets back in, I
think that they need to via executive
order and then also have a talk probably
with joint chiefs that if you have
something of this size and magnitude
that's going into restricted airspace,
it should be an automatic shootown
notice. Meaning that, you know, there's
no questions asked, you go, and you get
it. And I think part of the issues that
we saw with what happened with the
Chinese spy balloon that traversed
literally the United States and then you
know there was rumors that it was
collecting information all of that. The
point is is that it should have been
taken down day one. They should not have
allowed that to occur. So I think that's
the first part. The second part is
though from a government perspective is
you know we keep funding the DoD. keep
funding studies and programs, but we
really need to focus on what we can do
to come up with radar systems that can
get detect this because frankly I think
we're used to more um of a an ancient
way of warfare and that you know we're
looking at picking up large aircraft
versus some of these drones that might
be smaller and also too might be flying
at lower airspaces. So, I mean, it's
going to be a lot to unpack there, but I
do think it's ridiculous that they're
not shooting these things down or at
least trying to capture them, to study
them, and that that they would gaslight
Americans. You can clearly see that
that's a drone. So, to say otherwise is
just it's a farce.
>> Actually, this is one of the very
reasons why I decided to testify before
Congress a few weeks ago, because quite
frankly, we don't really have control of
our US airspace. We don't have awareness
of water in our skies.
Do you believe that the FBI has been
looking for a month and doesn't have any
answer about what these are when there's
so many?
>> Well, I've worked with the FBI in the
past and and they they tend to be very
very competent when they're doing
investigations. I do believe they have
some answers. I don't think they have
all the answers yet. What further makes
this more complicated, you have an issue
where these things are being seen over
civilian airspace. So, you have
jurisdictional issues, right? You have
from a federal perspective, you have FBI
leading a law enforcement investigation,
but you also have the Department of
Defense. You have folks like the US Air
Force and Office of Special
Investigations. You have DHS and even
the FAA. And so all these federal
agencies, forget about even the state
and local agencies are are trying to
work together and try to deconlict
what's in the skies. And unfortunately,
um they just don't seem to have a common
operating picture right now of exactly
what we're dealing with. Coming up, the
New Jersey witness who says he saw an
object the size of a school bus.
[Music]
This week, my colleague Dan Abrams
obtained a very interesting interview
with a New Jersey local who saw and
filmed an object he says was the size of
a school bus. It's very interesting in
light of asurances from the White House
that most of what they're seeing in New
Jersey are misidentified aircraft. Try
telling it to this local.
Well, I saw a drone. If it was a drone,
who knows what it was, but it was not
the drone you see people fly. There's
the picture. It was the size of a school
bus. Literally the size of my two-car
garage. Well, I have a onecar garage.
The size of a twocar garage.
and and what happened when you saw it or
you started taking pictures, etc.
>> Well, well, to back up a little bit, I'm
coming coming home from patrol live.
It's 12:30 at night and I get into
Montlair, New Jersey, and I see the full
moon and I'm like, well, it can't be a
full moon because the full moon was two
weeks ago. All of a sudden, it's getting
closer and closer. And then first, I
think it's a a a plane that a
helicopter. Then it's hovering right
over the woods as you're entering
Montlair. And it's a drone literally 40t
wide by 40t wide. Hovering right over
the woods. I pull over, get out of my
car, forget about the phone. I'm just
like looking at this thing wondering
what the heck it is. Then I said, "Oh, I
should take a picture." I grab my phone.
starts the second it like notices I'm
out there it just starts heading south
grab the picture it looks like the
picture looks like a dot looks like you
know at the very most like a plan N from
outer space flying saucer but when I got
a good close look at it when it was only
about 100 feet off the ground maybe 150
ft off the ground it looked like a drone
on steroids like literally a drone the
size of a garage
>> and you reported it to the authorities
>> I well I got home the first thing I did
is I googled I went on on X, I went on
Instagram, I like, is this a thing? And
I saw nothing except one little news
report from like Mars County patch about
some drones making noise and keeping
people up at night. Nothing. Then, so
the next morning, I called the FAA. I
called the FBI. And still to this day,
I've not gotten a response from either
of them.
>> Next up, we answer your questions. Why
can't we chase these objects back to
source? That's next.

Okay, so while we have this crazy
situation that the authorities are
saying, don't panic, don't panic,
everything's fine, and they have
absolutely no idea what's going on. It's
quite clear from your questions that
you're concerned. So, I've decided it'd
be quite important for us to try and
respond to some of the questions that
people are asking. So, we'll start off
with the first question. How can the
governor, Homeland, FBI say there is no
public safety concern with these drones,
but they don't know who they are, where
they're coming from? If they don't know
those simple facts, how can they
possibly know their intent? What if they
are programmed to go kamicazi on a
future date? It's a big national
security threat. And that's from at the
Frier, Eli. Well, I can tell you I
completely agree with that analysis.
They simply can't give any assurance
that there is no threat to national
security. And possibly the best reason
to show that is the statement that was
made by retired fourstar general Barry
McAffrey who told NBC News on the 8th of
December. When you see something of this
capacity, he's talking about the drones,
you wonder why it would be needed and
what they are doing. It implies a heavy
payload. And he went on to describe
these uncrrewed aerial vehicles, these
UAVs, these drones, or should we just
say these objects as a quote significant
threat to US national security. Quote,
"What concerns us mostly," said a
sheriff for Ocean County, Michael
Mastinardi, is that at this point, no
one has seen any of this unit's taking
off or landing. Right now, we just want
to identify what it is. And as you
rightly point out, when you have these
objects hovering not only over civilian
areas in New Jersey, but also over some
of the most sensitive military
facilities in the United States, places
that without naming names, I happen to
know there are nuclear weapons located.
This is a really grave issue. And as
this person speculates, you know, these
drones are large. They can potentially
carry a payload. What assurances do we
have that they're not being forward
deployed for some kind of future
operation? Okay, the next one from Odin
1028. Ross, I'd like to know how it's
possible that these things haven't been
tracked back to their source. Great
question. Seems to me that if they are
conventional, that is they do not
exhibit hypersonic speed or advanced
radar cloaking, it would be a simple
task. Absolutely. especially considering
how long they've been up at this at this
and they always seem to be in the same
place. Something doesn't add up here.
Well, look, I don't want to sound like
I'm blowing our own trumpet, but we
warned months ago that there was
something absolutely ridiculous about
the official drones explanation for
what's been seen over, for example, the
Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.
These drone sightings, so-called, go
back many, many months. In fact, they go
back years. And you know what? I think
has been happening here. I think that
the Department of Defense and the
various agencies like Homeland Security,
they've been hoping that this might
resolve itself. They've been using the
explanation that these are foreign
adversary drones, possibly Russian. And
the way it works for somebody like me as
a journalist, there's a lot of
backgrounding from intelligence
officials. So, they won't go on the
record, and the excuse is because they
don't want to escalate things with
Russia or China. But what they'll say
is, "Look, nudge nudge wink wink. We
adversary drones. They're Russian
organized crime gangs in the UK flying
them over UK bases. They're perhaps
Russian ships from across the over the
horizon deploying these drones into the
east coast of the United States. I'm
sorry that just doesn't wash. I'm
getting reports on these objects from
places like Arkansas, the Midwest over
military facilities close to adjacent to
military facilities. These objects are
being reported in New Zealand in my
country, Australia. A guy has just sent
me just overnight images of these
objects over Sydney airport. Nobody is
able to explain how a foreign adversary
power is able to deploy these objects
over so many countries in the world. Oh,
and by the way, I've had people from
Russia send me their descriptions of
what they're seeing in Russia, near
sensitive military bases in Russia. If
this is Russia, why are these objects
manifesting themselves over Russia? Same
with China. Coming up, you've heard the
evidence. Now, what do we think is
really going on? And why is every agency
of government so unforthcoming? That's
next.
So, thank you for joining us this
evening. You've heard the evidence.
You've seen the evidence from locals.
And frankly, the thing I find most
shocking is the inability of just about
every federal government agency to give
us any kind of an answer. the White
House, the Department of Defense, the
FBI, all of the agencies we entrust to
reassurers about national security and
public safety are not giving us any
confidence at all that they have any
answers. How can the White House
national security spokesman give any
assurance that there is no national
security or public safety threat when
frankly they admit they know absolutely
nothing at all? We're going to keep on
pursuing this issue for you like a dog
on a bone here on NewsNation and on my
show Reality Check, which you can also
find on YouTube. The conversation
continues. Go to @newsnation
on X, formerly known as Twitter, where I
will be holding a live spaces and we'll
keep you posted in coming days and weeks
as more comes to light. Thank you for
joining us. I'm Ross Koultart. See you
soon.
