TRUTH IS. 
>> OK, SO FOR MORE, WE'RE 
JOINED BY THE MAN HIHIMSELF. 
ROSS COLD, HARD TO NEWSNATION. 
SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 
INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, HOST 
OF THE REALITY CHECK PODCAST. 
ALWAYS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU. 
THANKS FOR JOINING US. THANK 
YOU. GOOD TO BE HERE. LET'S 
START WITH A CONVERSATION WITH 
CONGRESSMAN TIM BURCHETT. HE 
SPOKE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF 
5 TO 6 UNDERWATER ALIEN BASIS. 
HOW DID YOU COME BY THIS 
INFORMATION. HOW LEGITIMATE DO 
BELIEVE THESE CLAIMS COULD BE. 
IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT 
CORROBORATES THIS. 
>> IT'S A FUNNY GAME WORLD 
PLAYING REALLY IS NATASHA 
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THIS FUNNY 
GAME AT THE MOMENT WITH THE 
PENTAGON. CATEGORICALLY DENIES 
ANY KNOWLEDGE EXTRATERRESTRIAL 
ENGAGEMENT WITH THIS PLANET. 
YET THERE CONGRESSMAN WHO LIKE 
TO CHANGE THROUGHOUT KEELY 
VERY WELL INFORMED FROM SOME 
OF PRIVATE COMMITTEE HEARINGS. 
AND I SUSPECT THAT'S WHAT'S 
INFORMING HIM. HE'S SPEAKING 
TO A LOT OF THE PEOPLE I'VE 
BEEN SPEAKING COME FOR THE 
INSURER MILLET RE AND 
INTELLIGENCE SOURCES TELLING 
HIM MYSELF AND OTHERS THAT 
KNOWN HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IS 
ENGAGING WITH THIS PLANET AND 
MORE EITHER THE TAKING A VERY 
CLOSE INTEREST IN THE MILITARY 
FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE IN THE 
UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY 
NEW KIA WITH GUNS AND I THINK 
THAT'S WHY THERE'S A LOT OF 
ACTIVITY OFF CALIFORNIA 
BECAUSE THERE'S AN ENORMOUS 
NUMBER OF AEROSPACE COMPANIES 
AND OF INLAND. WE HAVE THE 
AREA 51 THE NEVADA TO STRANGE 
SAID DON'T THINK IT'S ANY 
SURPRISE. A LOT OF PEOPLE 
MIGHT THINK IT SOUNDS CRAZY, 
BUT FRANKLY INSIDE CONGRESS. 
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE 
REPRESENTATIVE BUCCI HEARING 
THINGS ENCLOSED COMMITTEE THAT 
CAN'T BE DISCUSSED PUBLICLY. 
AND I THINK THE GOVERNMENT, 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
REALLY HAS A BIT OF A WEIGHT 
ON ITS SHOULDERS TO MAKE A 
DECISION AT SOME STAGE SOON 
ABOUT WHETHER IT'S GOING TO 
COMPLAIN. WOW. SO, YOU KNOW, 
CONGRESSMAN MENTIONED HE'S 
HOPING FOR A ONE-ON-ONE WITH 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT UFO'S. 
>> DO ANTICIPATE ANYTHING 
COMING FROM THAT CONVERSATION. 
ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT THERE 
HASN'T BEEN MORE RELEASED 
SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE. 
>> LOOK, WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN, 
I THINK SINCE 2017 SINCE THE 
BIG NEW YORK TIMES REVELATIONS 
ABOUT A SECRET US 
INVESTIGATION AND THE 
PENTAGON, WE'RE ACTUALLY 
SEEING QUITE A LOT OF 
INFORMATION WE'VE HAD 
CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS I THINK 
FOR THE GLACIAL PACE WE SEE OF 
ANY REFORM AND ANY POLICY 
CHANGE IN IN WASHINGTON. WHAT 
WAS SEEN WITH YOU? A PIECE IS 
ACTUALLY HAPPENING PRETTY 
FAST. I DO THINK THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING THE 
ISSUE SERIOUSLY. I DON'T THINK 
THEY'RE INVOLVED IN ANY ACTIVE 
COVER UP. I THINK THAT BEING 
DISTRACTED BY THE MIDDLE EAST, 
THE ECONOMY AND THE WAR IN THE 
MIDDLE EAST, PARTICULARLY 
UKRAINE. BUT I THINK THERE 
PEOPLE IN THE ADMINISTRATION 
NOT WHO ARE NOT TUNING 
ATTENTION TO THE EU AP 
SUBJECT. THIS IS THE BIGGEST 
STORY IN HUMAN HISTORY. I KNOW 
IT'S TRUE. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
THE ADMINISTRATION KNOW ITS 
TRUE, INCLUDING I KNOW IT. 
MARCO RUBIO AS SECRETARY OF 
STATE ACTING NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISER THERE ARE PEOPLE NOW 
IN THE ADMINISTRATION AT IF 
BIA DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE LEVEL WHO ARE 
TAKING THIS ISSUE VERY 
SERIOUSLY INDEED. AND I MOVING 
BEHIND THE SCENES. OKAY. 
>> YOUR SPECIAL ALSO FEATURES 
A BOAT CAPTAIN WHO SAYS HE'S 
EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE YOU AP 
SIGHTINGS. HE TOOK THIS VIDEO. 
I WANT TO PULL IT UP HERE 
SHOWING A MYSTERIOUS ORB SENT 
A TRIANGULAR PATTERN THAT 
STAYED UP IN THE AIR FOR ABOUT 
10 MINUTES. HE WAS ALSO A 
WITNESS TO AN UNDERWATER 
EVENT. I WANT TO TAKE A QUICK 
LISTEN TO THAT TOGETHER. IT'S 
BASICALLY. 
>> AND ALONG THE LINE. WE 
DROVE OVER SOMETHING I'VE NO 
IDEA WHAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN. 
BUT AS WE DROVE OVER IT FOR 
THOSE FEW MOMENTS. FLASHLIGHTS 
UP AT US LIKE I'M TALKING MAKE 
IT LOOK LIKES LIKE BASEBALL 
STADIUM. LIGHTS IS SURROUNDING 
THE BOAT IS BEAMING UP ALL 
AROUND US. SAT THERE. THE REST 
TONIGHT WITH A GUN IN MY HAND 
WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO COME. 
CREEPING OUT OF THE WATER AS 
THAT SCARED. I GOT ON BECAUSE 
GARRETT EASY. BUT THAT WAS 
MOMENT.

FASCINATING ACCOUNT. ALSO 
TOTAL ASIDE HIS DOG IS THE 
CUTEST MOST ENDOWED DOG I'VE 
EVER IN MY BUT WHAT STANDS OUT 
TO YOU ABOUT THIS ACCOUNT, 
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR WITNESS 
ABOUT THE SIGHTING.

SIGHTINGS OF LIVES IN AND 
AROUND CATALINA REILAND 
PARTICULARLY MORE IMPORTANTLY 
AS WE SHOWED IN THE SHOT

A NORMALLY IS HAPPENING OFTEN 
ERA PLANES LOSE THE IDEA SPEED

THAT AREA. IT'S VERY DEEP.
