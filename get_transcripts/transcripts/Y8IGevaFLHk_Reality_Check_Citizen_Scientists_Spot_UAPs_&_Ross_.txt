Hello and welcome to Reality Check. I'm
Ross Kulart and today we have an
intriguing story. UAPs
recorded and analyzed off the coast of
Long Island, just to the east of New
York. Two twin brothers, Jerry and John
Tedesco, are Long Island natives. Both
of them are electrical engineers.
They're both passionately interested in
science. And as it happens, they also
have a very close interest in UFOs,
UAPs.
Now, they're concerned a few years ago
about possible cancer clusters on Long
Island. And so they build a mobile lab
in an RV to monitor atmospheric smog and
to also research electromagnetic
emissions such as those from cell phone
towers. But in 2021, as they're making
their research plan, they read the
report from the office of the director
of national intelligence. That's
America's intelligence boss, the chief
intelligence zar in the United States.
And the ODNI made an extraordinary
declaration back in 2021 that after 70
years of denial about the existence of
the reality of UFOs, not only did the
ODNI confirm they are real, they
acknowledged they are UAPs are a threat
to flight safety and a possible risk to
national security. And it fair it's fair
to say this finding by the ODNI sent
their research in a completely different
and as it happens very fruitful
direction. John and Jerry teamed up with
another Long Island native Donna Lee
Nardo a journalist investigator and
professional communications expert who's
also interested in science and UFOs.
They started in 2022 and they continued
through to July 2023. And in August this
year, they achieved the almost
impossible task of getting a field
research study on UFOs, UAPs off the
coast of Long Island, peer-reviewed and
published in the Open Journal of Applied
Sciences. Their report, which is now a
book called Nightcrawler, Eye on the
Sky, is groundbreaking. And I know their
research has captured the attention of
some very influential scientists and
officials, including in Homeland
Security and the FBI, who at the moment
do not publicly acknowledge their very,
very close interest in this subject.
They're looking much closer at the UAP
mystery than they currently care to
publicly admit. And if you acknowledge,
if you see just how close this site
where the Tedescos have been viewing
just off the coast of North Long Island
is to say the approaches to JFK
International Airport and of course one
of America's biggest cities, New York
City, you'd understand why there is a
public interest national security risk
here. So, the Journal of Applied
Sciences paper presents the findings
from their 10-month field study at the
Robert Moses State Park on the
Southshore of Long Island. Their
objective was to determine if unknown
aerial phenomena existed over this
coastal location and if so, to study it.
And boy, have they done well.
I want to tell you about a product that
happily is sponsoring reality check and
which also addresses some of the
egregious food that you Americans happen
to eat and it's all about the gut
cleanse biomplete 3. Uh the the theory
that is pushed by the gut cleanse
biomplete free product is that there is
a potential toxin in all of the quote
healthy foods that scientists have been
telling us to eat with a fraudulent food
pyramid for some considerable time. Um,
one day I will do a story on reality
check about the American ultrarocessed
food diet and why I fear for this
beautiful country that it seems to be
suffering from the appalling food that
it eats and it needs a fix. Well, maybe
that fix is the gut cleanse biomplete 3.
There's a Dr. Gundry, a world-renowned
cardiologist who is saying that is
there's a potential toxin in our food
that's causing huge digestive issues and
it's affecting millions of people
worldwide. The warning signs include
weight gain, fatigue, digestive
disorder, stiff joints, even skin
problems. And Dr. Gundry explains that
these side effects are often mistaken
for normal signs of aging because
digestive issues develop usually over a
matter of years and sometimes even
decades. And I can assure you that the
damage that we're talking about is
probably caused by these supposed health
foods and it's far from normal. The good
news is you can fix this problem from
your own home. It's very simple. You
just have to know which foods are
actually healthy and which contain this
hidden potential toxin. So you can find
this yourself at the gut
cleanseprotocol.com/
ross. That's gutcleansprotocol.com/ros.
And if you go there, you'll find that
after years of research, Dr. Gundry has
decided to release an informative video
to the public for free. and it's
uninterrupted showcasing exactly which
foods you need to avoid. Go find that
video at gut cleansprotocol.com/ros
and click on the link in the description
below. Okay, let's get into the show. So
guys, welcome to reality check. And I
suppose to kick off, how far away is
this site where you were doing your
study from the location that Navy pilots
off the east coast of the US were seeing
anomalous objects frequently and as I
understand it still do.
>> Well, first of all, it's it's a
privilege to be here, Ross, for all of
us. And um uh yes, so uh the Navy
sightings were um I believe down around
the Virginia area um and uh further down
I guess Jacksonville off the coast of
Jacksonville, Florida.
>> Uh whiskey uh
>> Whiskey 72 Virginia area,
>> right, is what they they classified it
as.
>> Training area. Um now, um the
information that we we have and what
we've heard back from Ryan Graves is
that, you know, this these things have
been spotted, uh literally 10 miles off
the shore of Virginia, uh and further
out. Um objects moving, you know, east
to west. Um I'm sorry, west to east in
this case. Nothing that moved back over
over land. Um, so we had chosen Robin
Moses State Park because the uh you know
the island extends literally from the
from the u uh the main coastline New
Jersey uh in the city about 140 150
miles um you know from the uh from the
from the from the coast and uh where
we're situated we're roughly about 55
miles at that point. So, we're we're
looking 55 miles out at sea uh in a
southwest uh direction and uh literally
about 55 miles from the deep water
trench. Uh so, we have a a pretty good
vantage point especially using our long
range sensors, the the Xband radar
system that we have that we that we got
FCC uh clearance for uh as experimental
use and some of the uh hyperspectral
cameras.
>> Let's cut to the quick. Donna, maybe you
can answer this. Yes.
>> Let's let's do some quick short answers.
Are these objects you all believe in
intelligently controlled on the basis of
the evidence you've uncovered?
>> I think that there is a possibility that
indeed they are. And I think John,
Jerry, and I feel that way.
>> Are they a technology?
>> I think that there's a possibility. That
is definitely among the
numerous possibilities. And I think
again that's a
a hypothesis that John Jerry and I share
>> and I'll throw this one open to all of
you. Is this evidence of a nonhuman
intelligence?
>> I think I think it's potential evidence
of non-human intelligence. I mean, it
appears to show awareness. It appears to
show some intelligent actions. Um uh at
times uh it it some occasionally you'll
see it uh meander along the shoreline
these objects or they'll loiter along
the shoreline but they also show we also
show an awareness of us being out there.
>> Yeah. And actually respond to some of
the things we're doing.
>> Right. Right. And we've used we've used
uh uh LAR. We've used long range torches
both visible light and uh invisible
light in the infrared. And we've had
we've had reactions. we have almost like
um a form of acknowledgement or
communications, you know.
>> Um
>> so, so when you say acknowledgement,
what do you mean? What happens?
>> So, in in one particular case, we had an
object that uh once we hit it with a
with a um uh infrared torch, uh we
noticed that in the night vision
cameras, this object suddenly moved its
position away from the torch.
>> It seems seem to the
>> It evaded the light. Yeah. And it did it
several times.
>> Uh look, the the my favorite video of
all of the ones you've got and uh it's
called the Peekaboo video.
>> Yes.
>> Um and there's a road sign. Is this shot
on infrared? There's a road sign and you
see a a whitish orb coming out from
behind the road sign. So obviously not
far away from you. It's on the beach and
it seems to be coming out peeking at you
and then tucking back behind the sign
again.
>> Yes. Yes, it's uh it was very unusual
that night. So we were just preparing
the instrumentation and setting up the
uh the infrared cameras and we noticed
in the recording that the cameras itself
uh had recorded an object that that uh
literally appeared from uh the right
side of the sign and as I moved the
camera back to that direction because I
you know I caught this in the camera at
the corner of my eye and I said I saw
something and I tracked this object as I
focused the camera on it. The object
moved suddenly behind the sign again.
And it did this several times. As I
moved the camera away, the object came
out of out from behind the sign and it
was basically chasing it back and forth.
>> So that's that's an object that appears
to know you're working with some kind of
camera technology. It knows it's being
monitored and it's trying to avoid being
captured on camera.
>> That's what we believe. Yes. Yes. that
it it did acknowledge, you know, that
there was being uh uh videotaped or it's
being being tracked in some way. And uh
it it did try to uh evade evade that
track
>> and it did it did this about four times.
>> And Ross, this was a few months into
phase one study. So these whatever this
is that we witnessed over and over again
at that site, it had come to know us,
but especially John because John torch
it with the with the with the high, you
know, heavy lights. Uh, and then these
objects sometimes, as you said before,
would react, blink, they would move
away. So, uh, I think that basically it
was trying to communicate or or give a
notice to John because it was John who
spotted it,
>> right?
>> So, what one thing I'm really interested
in is there's a video that isn't within
the period of your field study, but you
very kindly shared it with me. It was
shot I think on the 15th of July this
year and it appears to show a cub like
certainly polyhedral object and you hit
it with a lidar which is a laser that
can detect and range. It's a remote
sensing method. So you shine a lidar at
it. What happens? Describe it to me.
>> Yes. So uh what happened is the uh you
know we had u a refraction or reflection
at times from this object um and um the
odd part about it is that the uh
distance that was given back on the
reflection didn't really uh make a lot
of sense. It didn't correspond to an
object that I I initially thought was
about you know better than 500 meters
from where I was. Um, but the uh I hit
it twice in a clear line of sight and
the reflection back uh in both cases
showed about 45 ft from where I was
standing which which did make a whole
lot of sense.
>> Was it 45T away?
>> It was not 45 ft. It it it had to have
been much further than that. why I why I
got you know that kind of reflection
back um you know was is still kind of a
mystery and we're wondering whether you
know this has something to do with uh
gravitational lensing or some kind of
distortion you know around these objects
that is producing it. Now that's
interesting in the implications because
if it is gravitational lensing, it
suggests that whatever the object is, it
has a technology that's capable of
distorting spaceime, which of course is
the the the long speculated alcubia
theory for to explain how these objects
might be able to move.
>> Um, can I ask you this? Does the LAR
allow you to assess whether the object
had mass? Could it not just be a ball of
plasma or or perhaps some ball lightning
or something like that?
>> That's that's difficult to say. I mean,
you know, a reflection from the object
would indicate that there was some mass
there.
>> Uh but we don't know in what form. You
know, if it's uh you know, more of a a
gaseous state or if it's if it's there's
some solid to it. Um but uh you know,
there were times that we did get
reflections and other times we could get
a reflection. It actually looked like
the the LAR beam itself uh was never
really making contact
>> and um and almost in in a form of
distortion around it. It
>> it sounds to me like you've got a
non-human intelligence biting at your
heels underneath the table there. Is
that a little puppy or something you've
got under the desk?
>> Yes. Yes.
>> Just just dying to get out here. I
>> I feel the need to explain that to our
audience. Otherwise, they're going to
wonder what those strange noises are.
Sorry.
>> Um, can I just double check? There's an
aeronautical chart in what you sent me
which shows your area of interest and
there's a big circle in red. And the
thing I found interesting about this
chart is it highlights in my opinion why
UAP detection and monitoring matters and
why good science, good research like
yours into this phenomenon matters.
Because where you are located, your area
of interest signaled by that circle of
red on the chart,
>> that's that's one of the approach
routes, isn't it, into JFK. That's an
extraordinarily busy aircraft corridor.
I I don't understand how you guys can be
seeing dozens of weird anomalous objects
that apparently have mass moving around
in an aircraft corridor. And this isn't
a flight safety national security issue,
>> right? It's uh you know, we we've seen
this uh you know, since we started this
uh this research and uh you know, we've
been carefully examining the flight
corridor. Now, you have JFK to the west
of us and um you have other airports uh
you know, especially in Connecticut uh
you know, doing a flyover. You have you
have Macarthur airport. You have you
have uh LaGuardia as well uh to the
west. So you we have we have a very busy
corridor of flights. Um but we've also
seen these objects we've seen these
objects um in um in combination with
with air travel. You know we'll we'll be
out there with a hyperspectral cameras
and we'll record uh these objects that
seem to be at times in the flight paths
of these of these aircraft.
>> Well actually there is one object trying
>> Yeah. Well, there is the tic tac object
which is extraordinary. I mean, you you
basically show and it does. It looks
like a tic tac underneath an aircraft. A
cylindrical object passes right beside
an aircraft at speed during the day.
It's a very clear image. And the slow-mo
at around about 49 seconds shows how
close it came to the aircraft. I I held
my breath when I saw this because I
thought, one, you've captured a tic tac,
and two, it's right beside an aircraft.
I'm I'm not surprised that Homeland
Security and uh FBI and other agencies
are interested in your work. Another
interesting feature of that video is in
in one frame of it, we had noticed that
there was a flash and when we froze it
in that frame, you could see you could
see the object has a club shape to it.
The larger end in the direction of
travel and it had two lights on the
surface or two shiny uh reflective
surfaces or very reflective surf uh
reflective surfaces on on top of it. And
it would it only did this in one frame.
It looked like it changed its
orientation and and uh uh the these
these these two spots appear to be
lights on it, but it's very different
from from an aircraft. It's it's got an
odd shape to it. It's got it's got this
club shape to it,
>> right? And what Gerald said too, it's
it's only in one frame, you know, out of
that 45 seconds, it's only in one frame
of video that we saw this, you know, so
it's not navigation lights which have a
regular pattern to them, you know, flash
pattern. Um, you know, and that that's
predictable, you We'll see that with
most most aircraft.
This also had a a a reflective
silhouette to it almost like it was
appeared to be white and you could see
you could see the uh the uh the rising
sun underneath it. You could see the uh
you know the the orange glow from the
sun.
>> Give me a big picture here. You you did
this study over 10 months at this Robert
Moses State Park on Long Island just to
the east of New York. How many objects
of an anomalous nature did you see? And
what's your rough conclusion? I mean,
what what what do you think this is?
>> So, in this case here, we've seen one
that appear to be almost like a tic-tac
shape. Most of the objects we've been
seeing uh look like this, what we call
spheroids with a with a polyhedrin
center to it, something that looks like
a like a cube or a rotating cube of some
sort. So, so this is very similar to the
object described by FA18 pilot Ryan
Graves and his colleagues that were
being seen by Navy pilots off the east
coast just a bit further south off the
coast of Virginia. You're seeing are you
seeing Have you seen the phenomenon of
the I think it's the cube within the
sphere?
What we've been seeing is it's more uh
more of a polyhedral shape to it, but
depending on the uh on how many sides
this polyhedrin has. I mean, it could
you could have a side that looks that
looks perfectly square and lit up. And
if it's the more sides it has, the more
rounder it becomes. So, it could look
like a a a sphere around a around a
cube, right? And the spin rate is
variable, too. It's not uh you know
we've seen them rotate at a at a um uh
at a slow a relatively slow pace and
then other times we'll see them where
they they seem to they seem to almost
speed up. They they accelerate and when
they accelerate they they get brighter
and they almost look like a you know
they give off this intense light this
spheroid light which uh you know it's uh
the colors vary from from orange, white,
red, green we've seen
>> and um they can be they can be pretty
intense. Um,
>> can I ask is there a
>> do you ever see these objects with kind
of a plasmatic hue around them? Some
kind of aura around them? A lot of
scientists, a lot of scientists I've
spoken to say that if there is a
propulsion system, you might see a
purplish hue. Have you seen that?
>> Yes. Yes. As a matter of fact, we have
do with a video of one with a a bluish
or purplish hue around it.
>> Yeah, it's it's in a video, but we've
also have UVC detection on it. Uh now
UVC is an ultraviolet C-band uh
detector. These these are very sensitive
binary detectors and um we've had it out
there and uh in this particular case uh
while observing the object, our detector
went off several times indicating that
there was a there was a UV energy that
was coming off of this object. Uh UV is
is indicative of a plasma or a some kind
of a discharge, an arc of some sort
that's giving off this particular
wavelength. Did you pick up any gamma
radiation, any dangerous ionizing
radiation?
>> Nothing like that. We, you know, might
have been too far from it distance-wise,
but we were always monitoring for uh for
the higher energy radiation for alpha,
beta, gamma, and so forth. Um, that's
not something that we that we were able
to indicate.
>> Donna, can you do the broad brush for
me? I'm I'm really interested in getting
a summary, a short encapsulating
paragraph that summarizes the scope of
your work and how many objects, how many
anomalous events you recorded. Can you
give me that rough pen sketch? Well, I I
will say uh with evidence to back up 50
because we have approximately 50 video
clips of various phenomena that we put
into the bucket because of investigating
all other options that they're unknowns.
So, while we may not know for sure what
they are, we know they're not anything
that's prosaic. They're not they're not
not an airplane. It's it's we don't
think that any of them were drones at
least not drones in the normal sense
drone because no flashing lights no
sound you know John's acoustics Jerry's
acoustics would up
>> right and I what I do want to say too is
that you know we spent a good portion of
this research uh looking for prosaics
prosaic explanations for this stuff. So
we we examined, you know, a lot of the
flight travel, the different various
different aircrafts, the the engine
sounds, and uh and we we we categorized
a lot of that stuff.
>> Yeah.
>> And um like I said, we spent I would say
probably at least six months making the
determination whether or not it was a
commercial aircraft um or something that
we could, you know, a biomass of some
sort, you know, uh birds, bats, you
know, uh insects. So we tried to isolate
as much as we could uh before putting
this into that that other bucket. And
one of the first things we did is we did
an assessment of the scene. We we
actually mapped the flight corridor of
the airport which is 38 miles to the
west. So most of the time we would steer
away from that area if we would and most
time we would spend most of our
observations uh after 12 or most of the
airflights would diminish down through
virtually nothing
>> and that's still seeing these objects
>> phenomena was during that after 12
those.
>> Yes. Right. The bulk of it. Yes,
>> there was outliers. But one other thing
is John and Jerry when they first
started building the night crawler the
telemetry vehicle they the platform to
observe and and with all the sensors
that we take to these beach sites to uh
do study. Um John lives near an airport.
So John spent consider time also just
hovering around that area because you
can look up into the sky and they
studied the planes, they studied the
tracks, they studied the sounds, they
studied how it looks with this camera,
how it looks with the IR camera, how it
looks with the planetary camera. So they
had a pretty good idea of what uh would
be a plane in the sky before we even got
to Robert Moses skate park.
>> Right. From from our vantage point,
especially where we live, you know, it's
all you do is look at planes.
Yeah, it gave us an advantage.
>> Yeah,
>> even found some anomalies because they
were showing me charts before the
project got started. It was just in the
P ages. They were building the the first
night crawler platform and um they were
seeing things in in in the sky around
the airport that they were already able
to differentiate from a from a plane,
from a helicopter.
>> You know what I find hilarious is you
guys have essentially become the UAP
Ghostbusters vehicle. This this RV of
yours sounds legendary. Um t tell me
what you've got in there in the way of
scientific equipment. It's quite an
extraordinary vehicle I understand.
>> Yes. So it's uh you know it was quite a
creation from uh from some start to well
not quite finished yet but it's still
growing.
>> There was actually two versions of it.
>> Yeah. And this is the second version. Uh
the first version was actually built too
high. Um had too much weight. you know,
it's the the the vehicle could you
couldn't get out of its own way. Um, so
we ended up
>> we ended up with a with a with a regular
RV, a 30-foot, you know, RV,
>> and we uh kind of gutted it out. We put
the equipment in there. Um, actually
built a Faraday cage around it, believe
it or not. Uh, it's a metal mesh built
within the walls, the floors, the
ceiling, and once everything
>> just explain why you would build a
Faraday cage just for
>> our Yeah. Yeah. So, a Faraday cage was
basically to isolate the equipment from
any um uh external EMI external
emissions, radio emissions. Uh we wanted
to make sure that it wasn't influencing
our measurements. Um so, uh like I said,
once this thing is closed up there,
everything from the external, you know,
even cell phones, you know, your cell
phone signal would pretty much die out
once the door is closed. Um and this is
um uh this was necessary in order to
safeguard our data, you know. Um we we
collected a lot of data over that period
of time and uh we found early on that
even some of the acoustic data was being
interfered with with radio frequencies
because you got 5G cell towers down
there that are that are they're working
at these these you know momentary high
power levels these peak power levels and
they could actually uh induce uh a radio
frequency into a microphone and it would
sound like audio you know it's it sound
like it's an acoustic tone but it's not.
it's actually, you know, being picked up
by the EMI.
>> So, the crucially important thing here
is that like the US Navy with the Nimits
incident, you've not just taken video
and used the A1 human eyeball to witness
these objects. You've also used
hyperspectral imaging cameras. You've
got wideband marine radars, which you've
actually got two, so you can cross
reference. You can what do you what do
you call triangulate those radars? more
accurate image. Um you've got um
different types of UV camera, infrared
camera. Uh give me what else have you
got? Like I mean how much did this cost
you? It must have been a phenomenal
amount of money to even buy a
hyperspectral camera.
>> It was approximately uh probably about
close to $250,000.
>> Yeah, maybe a little bit more by this by
this time. It's probably after that
>> 275 but updating but it's of course we
we're continually updating you know the
course and a lot of it came out of my my
retirement you know
>> I was about to say what do your
long-suffering wives say about you
spending the retirement fund on this uh
UAP passion project
>> you better get busy with this project
luckily luckily we did get a funer that
helped us because that money was running
low we had did get a funer who believed
in what we were doing and uh
>> he funds us the rest of the way to to
finish up the phase one project.
>> Right. It was the same funer that that
helped with the Galileo project with
Harvard University.
>> Do do you want to acknowledge that funer
if they if they want to be publicly
acknowledged? I think it's important.
>> I would love to. I mean, you know, uh I
think he's a phenomenal phenomenal
person, you know. Um uh his name is
Eugene Jung and uh
>> great human being.
>> Yeah. great human being and and a and
and and he's he's well he's he's got a a
big interest in this stuff and and
science in general and promoting it and
uh and the cause and he's also been um
um you know very helpful during you know
the um uh you know the the the virus
outbreak you know that you know he's
helped a lot of different causes he's uh
but he's g he's given a lot he's given a
lot back to society
>> Donna
>> you know a lot of money was spent for
phase one study A lot of money is needed
to continue phase 2 and beyond. But
there are university endeavors right now
at the university level uh trying to
approach
some of the same uh objectives we we
have and we have results, we have data,
we have a published paper, we have a
book. Um and we're continuing to look
for funding for the phase two study
which we have a lot of new objectives
that we'd like to tackle. And uh we you
know some of these other university
endeavors are asking for millions have
received millions. And so we were able
to fulfill the phase one study with data
that was recognized in a scientific
journal
and has attracted the interest of the
FBI expressed an interest in our work.
Um state and local government has
expressed an interest in our work. First
responders we're working collaborating
with them. It goes on and on and on. And
we've updated the academic community who
who also has been very supportive.
>> But we've not received any funding the
same type of funding at the level of the
academic uh
>> right and and we remain transparent too
to to everything that we find any
finding that we have. It's it's it's uh
we're trying to be transparent and uh
you know we're we we like collaboration
and feedback from other you know from
academia especially you know the uh
there's other professionals. there's uh
we you know we work with pilots and and
of course you know law enforcement and
that sort of thing but uh you know it's
not something that you know we want to
keep under wraps and you know we we try
to get that information out there and we
and early on we did it through a book.
>> So to finish my point we do the these
types of studies evidently at a fraction
of the cost and and produce results we
hope also in in the second phase.
>> I totally agree with you Donna. I mean,
one of the reasons I'm so keen to get
you guys on is because what you've shown
is that good citizen science can
actually make breakthroughs. I find the
work that you've done very very
exciting. And I I want to get into the
nitty-gritty of that. Now, one of the
things that you talk about in your RF
report, your radio frequency report, is
that there's a spike at uh 4.06 GHz. And
it doesn't seem to be a broadband
frequency. It's not um anything like
Wi-Fi, 4G or 5G.
Do you think that spike is associated
with the anomalous phenomenon that
you've been videoing?
>> You know, it's it's hard to say. you
know, we're unfortunately we're, you
know, we we're we're nearby, you know,
uh cell towers, 5G cell towers that were
that are that giving out pretty pretty
strong uh signals and and u a lot of
them some of these signals are spread
spectrum. They're they random but there
there are a couple of signals that you
know during times of um um you know
higher traffic with the observations
we've noticed uh carriers around 1.6
gigahertz and 3 gigahertz you know and
these are the signals that we're really
uh kind of focusing on at this point. um
some of the other signals, you know, you
they they they you know, they could be
GPS there there is uh there there uh law
enforcement communications as well that
we that we're intercepting. But it's a
but it's at times it's very difficult to
isolate the noise the background noise
from all these other signals. Um like I
said, the ones that we're really focused
on right now is the is the is two in
particular which is the three and the
1.6. So you are seeing something in the
3 gigahertz range which of course is a
well-known mysterious range.
>> Yes. Yes. And and we're seeing it
correlates actually when we when these
objects seem to appear,
>> right?
>> So So the 3 gigahertz range that's been
I think it's also the range that's been
picked up at the Skinwalker Ranch in
Utah. You're seeing something anomalous
in that frequency range as well.
>> Right. Right. And what's what's what's
tricky about that signal too is that
there's some um there's some radar uh
you know especially where you know we're
close to the water there's ships that
use a very similar frequency range which
is Sband radar. Uh Sband radar is
anywhere between 2.9 and 3.1 GHz. So we
very careful as to try to isolate that
from these erroneous signals that we
that we've been getting. And um there
are times that these ships are not
within 36 miles of our location and
we're still receiving some of these
signals with those higher activity.
>> Y now I want to squeeze into this into
this program as many of the videos and
images as possible so that our audience
can see some of the excellent work that
you've done. You see four orb objects
over the ocean from the beach. Just talk
me through what we're seeing on that
video. Can you just describe it to me?
What what what what are we what are we
seeing on that video? One appears to be
in the water. There's an object either
in the water or just above it.
>> And then I think it's you, John. You you
say there's a shadow of something dark
that you can see at the back.
>> I believe that was Jerry. Yeah. Yeah.
>> That was actually Yeah, that particular
shadow is actually an artifact produced
by the IR. It's almost what the mountain
climbers called Brock inspectors, but in
our case, it's it's produced by an IR
instead of a fog. But the there was
something anomalous that happened. Tell
me what happened.
>> Yes. There's uh what you talked about
there was we actually saw um an orb of
light
one of the sphere we're talking about.
There was one hovering low over the
water. It was actually casting a
reflection on the water and was changing
its elevation periodically. It was also
changing its spin rate. As it as it spun
faster, it increased its luminosity. As
it decreased its spin rate, the
luminosity would drop and you would
almost start to see that polyhedral
appearance. There was also about four
other objects, four or five other
objects that appeared and all of them
were in different spectral ranges. The
only one that was visible was the one on
the water and this is what we thought
maybe some kind of signature management
or or their ability to change spectral
uh uh spectral. The the objects that
were that were basically over the over
the water uh you know uh low over the
horizon were in the infrared. uh they
were being detected in the infrared. Uh
they couldn't be seen visibly by any of
us. Uh the only object that we could see
uh clearly and um and was very visible
was the object that was over the water.
Uh we approximated was it was roughly
about 13 ft and it was casting a a light
uh that was u um you know the seas were
pretty calm at that point and you could
see this rotation of this light under
the object itself.
>> It was very intense. experience.
>> There's another video, video four. Uh
it's um an orb with satellites. Uh a big
purplish orb has a whole lot of little
orbs around it and they're strobing like
crazy. I mean, it's quite an
extraordinary video. Can you talk me
through that?
>> Yeah, that's one that would appeared off
the shoreline. Uh we noticed this large
the large orb in the middle was actually
uh we could actually uh make that out
visibly. It was back it was both in the
visible and IR range. the smaller orbs
or the smaller sat satellite orbs were
all in the infrared. They we couldn't
see with our eyes, right? And it's
something else I want to say too is that
we were tracking this on the main
monitor, the main the main video monitor
inside the RV. And what we do is we want
to make sure that this these are not,
you know, u star constellation, part of
a constellation, star pattern, you know.
So, we used, you know, uh stellarium
mapping and there's a couple of other
utilities we use as well out there in
the field. And what we'll do is we use a
dry erase marker. We'll actually mark
the positions on the monitor which is
which is fixed at that point and we'll
look for this change in in in the
movement of the stars you know with the
of course with the rotation of the
earth. You know these objects would
remain fixed for long periods of time
and uh we knew right away that they
weren't stars. It's I think uh there's
been researchers in the past that have
called them pseudo stars.
Now, the other thing I noticed about
that video is you describe an anomalous
battery drain on video 4. Yes.
>> So, what happened?
>> Uh, when we were out there, I mean,
these were relatively close to the
shoreline. They weren't that far. The we
uh most some so many hyperspectial
cameras we had had a full battery drain
and we had checked the batteries before
we went out there. So, that was
something we couldn't explain and that's
happened several times when we have
these encounts of encounters. Now this
this is obviously a very common
phenomenon with people who try to record
with cameras anomalous phenomena. It
seems to be able to screw back with us
by draining our electrical devices. How
how often did that happen to you?
>> Uh probably at least half a dozen times
maybe. Yeah, maybe over the the period
of two years at least at least six six
times that we we were pretty uh sure how
how charged with the charge state of the
batteries and um there's no reason that
the batteries should have discharged as
quickly as they did. You actually had a
time where we actually had a complete
power failure even the generator cut
out.
>> Yes.
>> Well, that's that famous scene in Close
Encounters, isn't it? Where where
everything goes dead.
Um, I have to admit there are times in
your videos where even you guys sound
like, you know, you're pretty seasoned
observers, all three of you, but there's
times when all of you sound a bit
freaked out as the objects are coming
towards you.
>> We were. It happened often. We were
spooked.
>> It's like an episode of Blair Witch
Project. It's quite funny because um uh
on on video 20, you see the three
objects in a distance. It's about 12:30
at night, so it's dark. It's the It's
the witching hour. And um I think John,
you say on the audio, we just had a
close encounter. It came right up to us
on the beach. We ran like a bunch ofies.
>> Excuse. It was an embarrassing It was an
embarrassing moment for us. Wasn't a
high point.
>> But the the the bit I liked was that was
effing unbelievable. Uh clearly it had a
huge effect on you. what you're seeing
with your eyeball is more dramatic than
what you're capturing with your camera.
>> Yes. Yes. That was uh that was an that
was an event that happened um in the
roughly in the end of the second month
of our research.
>> It was August 28th, 2022. I remember I
remember a date,
>> right? It happened just after midnight.
Uh it was 12:15 when we actually had the
encounter. But um that was a there was a
triangular formation of um we weren't
sure if it was a part of one object. But
I I would say that right now the
consensus is that there was three
separate objects. Well, we confirmed it
because when we watched that video uh uh
the second time around after we after
the recordings were made is we we panned
we had panned over to the right and the
the objects actually separated and they
rose in elevation. There was a bright
red flash and all the objects were gone
>> and they disappeared. Yeah. So, but they
remained stable out there for almost 45
minutes that that pattern and that night
um the we were had winds of wind gusts
of greater than 35 miles per hour. So,
you know, for something to remain as
stable as it was, I mean, it wasn't it
wasn't uh drones, it wasn't balloons, it
wasn't any of that stuff. These were in
fixed positions and even a helicopter,
you're going to have movement with with
those kind of winds. You're not going to
have something.
>> No sound at all. And uh and and nothing
visible. nothing in the visible light.
It was all in the infrared.
>> There's one particularly interesting
video. I think it's first shown in video
five. It's called merging sky objects
with cohion. And you see a large glowing
object that seems to be flickering and
then it moves up and perhaps into
another object that seems to be hidden
inside the cloud. Can you talk me
through that one?
>> Yes, that one caught us by surprise. We
were uh you know we were nearing an area
called Democrat Point. Um uh and uh I
had been videotaping uh an object up
there and um uh the object uh had it
seemed to have rotation to it. There was
it was giving off like a kaleidoscope of
color as it was rotating and uh tracking
the object. uh you know I realized that
there was another um source of light
that was coming down from the cloud
layers and it was getting it was getting
sharper and sharper and it seemed to
form um the same shape as the object
that that I was visualizing up to that
point and the object never really did
come down from the cloud layer but you
could see the brightness intensity of it
and then this this this object that I
had been tracking seemed like it cohesed
or fused with the other object and a uh
synchronized rotation together. Uh you
could see it was twice its size and they
were rotating in the same direction and
then both objects just moved up into the
cloud layers and that was it. We we
didn't see anything further. Um but we
went frame by frame. We analyzed the
tape the the the video on it and um um
I'm dating I'm dating myself. I keep
saying tape, you know, the digital
recording. And um you know, you could
see that, you know, within these frames,
you could see that these objects almost
if they if they weren't cohes, they're
extremely close together when they
synchronized rotation.
So, one of the questions I should have
asked you early on is you've got these
two radars and what's the benefit of
having two radars and and and a further
question on this question is how often
were you able to confirm that the
objects that you were seeing were solid
enough to register on radar?
>> I'll I'll start it out is we have two
two radars on top of the vehicle. We
have one in a horizontal axis, one on a
vertical axis. And the reason being is
we've got a better better cross-section
of the object. One gets higher
elevation, one that's vertically
mounted, one the horizontal one gets a
wider sweep an aszmouth. Yeah. So the
the the the Xband radar, what we want to
do is we want to capture uh distant
ships out there where we're going into
phase two and and um we're seeing some
anomalous uh reflections that um they're
they're they're called anomalous
propagations. Um there's there's
something that was discovered back in
the 20s of of a reflected signal using
you know uh radar system even the early
radar systems that would not lose energy
they would be reflected back and the
intensity was the same. Um if an if a if
a if a reflected uh radio wave would
bounced off in the ionosphere and came
back late the the intensity level the
energy levels would be uh quite a bit uh
you know um lower than the actual
transmitted transmitted signal. This is
something that we've been seeing on a
regular basis. C can I just can I just
ask though very quickly, have you been
able to get radar tracks of some of
these anomalous objects to confirm that
they are delivering a radar image?
They're solid enough to deliver a radar
image.
>> What we get is we get solid they they're
intermittent. It's the uh the context we
get, but they correlate with the with
what we're seeing on hyperspectral
cameras. They'll appear in the same
areas,
>> right? At times at times. And then
you'll see you'll see reflections uh in
totally different locations. Uh but they
they they don't remain they don't remain
with a continuous sweep. You know, it's
you'll see these objects that um uh
you'll see one sweep that the object
will be there. You and and they're
colorcoded. The the the screen itself,
the echo trails are red. You know, we
have red red defined as uh as a solid
reflection. uh when you're doing um uh
rain studies or you're doing uh
precipitation, you know, you'll have a
you'll have a a color maybe green or
orange indicating that there's that the
density is not there. And these objects
are solid. These are solid returns, but
they they're not there all the time.
>> That's that's what I was coming to. So,
these aren't rainclouds. They're not
biomes. They're not birds out over the
ocean. They're not insect swarms. um
you've been able to exclude those
prosaic explanations.
>> Yes.
>> Right. Right. And we'll we'll adjust the
clutter settings on the radar, make sure
that we're not getting sea clutter. You
know, sometimes wave heights can can
interfere with the radar radar signal.
We also can we're also able to tilt the
radar. We have an an actuator, an arm
that actually tilts the the antenna, the
radar antenna. So, we're looking
straight up into the sky at times. We
can adjust that level. The other thing
is we're also looking at the ADSB
software. So we're tracking you know uh
commercial traffic commercial uh traffic
uh transmissions. So we could we can
visualize that on on a monitor.
>> The other thing is for biomass we could
see that with hyperspectral cameras very
easily
>> and we're also tracking the uh merchant
uh ships out there as well with marine
marine apps.
>> It's called Maraps
>> Mar apps. So we're watching we're
watching for all these things and trying
to identify as much as we can identify.
I I really admire what you guys have
done, you know, because I've I've
actually priced a hyperspectral camera
and from memory, they're about $50,000.
You know, they're very they're a very
expensive piece of kit. You really have
put your heart and soul into this as a
scientific project, haven't you?
>> We have.
>> Yeah, we we've we put our best in it.
It's a big it's a big investment in in
equipment and uh a huge dedication. I
mean, just to be out there, you know,
for hours at a time, sometimes not
seeing anything. And it's a, you know,
you you got to be patient. You got to be
uh uh vigilant as far as
>> researchers like Donna and we get some
other researchers out there, but they're
not being paid. You're out there
volunteering their time for 12 hours all
night long. That's right. You know,
>> so listen, I I know you I know you boys
have had your own weird experience in
your youth. And I'm going to ask you
both whether you've ever seen a UFO
before this Long Island project. But I'm
going to go to Donna first. Donna, are
you an experiencer? if you had any
experience with the phenomenon yourself
before this research.
>> Absolutely. Uh right now I live on a
hill on Long Island uh
off the Northshore but not uh directly
on the Northshore and I've seen things
in the sky here. I've seen uh orbs of
many kinds uh luminous orbs in the
distance and I've also seen an uh people
just seeing a red orb. I don't see a red
orb. I saw a red orange orb that
actually appeared to travel through the
trees and I watched it from window to
window on the south side of my home and
I actually saw it. This was like uh
before 12 midnight and this was a few
years ago maybe 2015 and I actually saw
it land on the house kitty quarter to
mine across the street and I tried to
wake everyone in my household up and no
one cared. Everyone thought they were
dreaming or I was dreaming. And so
that's happened quite a few times where
I've seen orbs. Usually they are of the
luminescent variety, but this one was
red orange, like a fluorescent red
orange, and it was pretty sizable,
although I I don't I'm not adept at
sizing it correctly. Um, and then of
course I had a hitchhiker effect during
the course of study with John and uh
Jerry. Uh John did as well. And I saw
for the first time uh and uh a small orb
woke me up right in my bedroom which was
very dimly lit. And it wasn't a very
bright orb and it was a very small orb
about six inches in diameter. But I
opened my eyes and there it was, you
know, just a few feet from my face and I
watched it move across the wall from my
door to the closet area. And then I was
just
telepathically communicating with it
because I didn't know what else to do
and I thought that it was important
because I had not seen such a phenomena
before and I thought wow you know I'm
learning a lot about high strangeness
and it's really the more you open that
trap the more you see you notice maybe
because your mind is tuned into it and
um it it wasn't like I said the light
wasn't very light it had very low albido
but even though it had low albido it was
only there less than a minute and I saw
it actually dim further than it already
was and I and I was sad. This all
happened very quickly and I was sad
because I felt like it would whatever it
was was departing and which it did but I
I wished it a message. I said I hope you
know you come back and I I get to know
you know who or what you are. I didn't
know any other way to communicate with
it other than as a human.
>> Did it didn't it talk back
>> but object or an animate object? I'm not
sure. You didn't talk back, Donna?
>> No. And I didn't, you know, I don't
think I received any me I don't feel
I've received any return messages, but I
don't feel that I felt any negative
feeling in return. If anything, it was
lukewarm or positive. So, I'm still
hopeful and maybe tonight when I retire
and go to bed, I'll I'll wish it back.
Now, Jerry and John, there's a really
interesting story that I understand you
have from when you were younger boys as
twins, and there was a very strange
visitor came to your door. Are we
talking about a men in black? Well, you
know, something was interesting is I I
compare him to uh I don't know if you
ever saw The Exorcist, the the trailer
for The Exorcist when that the priest
shows up with the dark suit and the
fedora hat and he knocks at the door and
it's already foggy out of
it was it was a trailer for the ex the
uh the exorcist. But that's what this
guy looked like. He was in this dark
suit. He had a fedora hat and he claimed
he was working with an exterminating
company called Slugger.
The only thing is, if you can believe
that.
>> Yeah. The only thing is he he invite he
invited himself in. Of course, we were
young and we had a we had a a friend
over there that was older than we were
and uh and she she let him in. So, he he
sat himself down in the living room and
he started talking about he had a a a
suitcase full of uh uh materials on UFOs
and uh Edgar Casey and and and various
paranormal phenomena. And he started to
talk to us about the phenomenon. He
tried to he he would talk to he would
talk to my older brother and say that he
he saw him as a as a as a psychic
sensitive or or someone who was very
intuitive
>> and he he talked about uh paths we may
take in life
>> related to this and the odd thing about
it is none of us could remember any
physical attributes about about this
character couldn't remember what he
looked like
>> you know I remember the hat you know he
had removed his hat but I cannot
remember what he looked like and and
none of us We could
>> How old were you many times?
>> Um I would say probably seven maybe 70
years old at the time.
>> Seven or eight.
>> 708 was maybe 12 or
>> Yeah. And it was cool.
>> The cool bit I like is you did your own
research into slugger bug which is a
great name by the way for a pest
extermination service.
>> Is is there a slugger bug?
>> There's there was a slugger bug in in
Florida.
later. You decades later,
>> decades later in Florida, but nobody
nobody that name. And I know the
authorities were called in at that time,
you know, to to to investigate it. And
uh nobody else saw this character. And I
remember when he arrived, when he left,
we had quickly, you know, looked out the
windows in the door to see if he got
into a car and that that sort of thing.
We never we never did see what vehicle
he arrived in, whether whether he
walked. But if he walked, he walked very
fast.
>> Yeah. Like I said, not remembering the
attributes.
>> When you were twin boys, presumably
reading comics and watching bad TV. Were
you al also interested in UAPs? Did you
have any paranormal experiences as kids
apart from that weird Men and Trilby hat
Men in Black incident?
>> Yes, we have. you know, as as twins,
maybe maybe it's more an occurrence with
twins, but
>> you know, we've had we've had um uh
shared dreams. We've had premonitions
that uh um you know, I I I felt at the
time, I don't have them as as many many
of these things occurrences now, but as
a kid, I remember seeing things that a
day or two or a week later they would
they would come to be, you know. Um
>> can I ask you this? Do you do you think
the reason why the phenomenon has shown
itself to all three of you may have
something and I'm inviting you to
speculate. Do you think it may have
something to do with the fact that your
minds were twigged as young people with
the fact that there is something out
there that is anomalous and is
paranormal? Do you have to have a switch
flicked in your head to make you even
aware of the existence of this
phenomenon? That was that was an idea we
were considering
>> experience like Gary Nolan a lot of the
people who are in
>> That's true too. Yeah.
>> I was I was thinking of Gary I mean
Gary's I know Gary's come out and looked
at your project and been very impressed
and and he had his own paranormal
experience as a I think an 11year-old
newspaper boy. Um
>> uh he had a gigantic craft hover over
him and he had a kind of a condundolini
experience a vibration experience in his
bedroom. Um, what um what intrigues me
is the possibility that that you were
sought out by that weird character all
those years ago when you were
sevenyear-old boys and that that might
have directed the course of your
research. Did you ever think about that?
>> We've always we've always wondered about
that.
>> We we Yeah, we did actually wonder about
that. I mean, that kind of that kind of
got our interest going in in uh things
like UFOs or paranormal phenomena.
>> Yeah, it kind of paved the way. I mean
you know even looking into technology
and so forth you know uh the kind of
careers that we chose later on was
>> yeah the technical careers we wanted to
understand these things in some way
>> right and we've always had that interest
>> they tell this story because it's very
pivotal in their in their life and so
before they even knew that there would
be a night call nightcrawler research
platform they they told me this story
years ago uh so it made an impression on
them and I think it did fashion them to
have an interest in.
>> Yeah, I know this one will drive the
debunkers crazy, but I do wonder
sometimes whether there is a a
consciousness that's going around
twigging people like yourselves, you
know, inserting ideas into your head in
dreams or in um you know, semi-waking
states and and implanting the idea, you
know, you guys should take an interest
in UAPs, UFOs. I I I suspect it's not a
coincidence that you've got this
interest. One thing I want to move to is
the five observables. Alzando Lou
Alzando talks about the five
observables, the various phenomena, the
anomalous phenomena signs. And one of
the videos that you've got appears to
show one of those observables. Video
six, NIR, water orb and hovering orbs.
You see an orb seemingly moving in and
out of the water which suggests that
whatever these objects are, they're
transmedium. Do do you agree?
>> Yes. Because in we had a couple of
instances where where some of these
objects we had noted noted them touching
down on the water and they would seem to
pass through the water without
disturbing the water which was
interesting.
>> Yeah. And we recorded that several
times. you know they're uh you know you
know we we use in that case we use the
you know we have a camera one of the
hyperspectral cameras is is swire it's a
shortwave infrared and what that gives
us is it's it's it's uh the water has a
high absorption rate at that wavelength
so it comes up black there's nothing
else you can see uh other than the dark
ocean but if there's an object that is
that is on top of that water it's seen
very clearly in swire we can see that
object and if it's if it if it's uh sub
if it submerges like we believe it did,
it didn't disturb the water. It just it
just kind of shrunk in size and it was
it was it seemed to be under the water.
>> So you did you do think it actually went
into the water and showed no visible
what I'm looking for is it showed no
visible disturbance to the surface of
the water as it entered.
>> Exactly. That's that's what we noted. We
haven't seen any disturbance of the
water which was a very odd
>> there's another document which I think
is really important and it shows a
discshaped object almost a craft looking
object. It has the purplish glow that we
were talking about earlier. And if I'm
not mistaken in this still image it
shows a bright underlight. Do you know
the one I'm talking about? Is this I
think that's a still picture that looked
like a a square inside the uh the
circle.
>> Yes. Yes, that's right.
>> That's that's the one we uh that's the
the still frame.
>> Right. Okay. So, that was a still frame
that was from the observation in August
the August 28th. That was the um
encounter that we that we had at the
time. There was an object that under the
triangle. There was an object that
seemed to uh literally fall out of the
sky and and Donna observed it first and
we were able to track it uh with the
cameras, the the uh infrared cameras,
the night vision cameras. And uh this
object seemed to move closer to our
location to to the shoreline and then
back off again. And what we ended up
doing was we were hitting it with a um
uh a visible torch, a 100,000 lumen
light, and we were all able to see the
reflection. It was no longer infrared.
We could see the reflections from the
from the flashlight. And I was able to
take uh image, still images from it and
enhance those images. And it appears
like there's some kind of a a trans um
an opaque or translucent uh dome around
a polyhedral shape in the center of it.
That's that's what excited me about that
still video. And and you see a small orb
that comes out from a distant triangle
and it's coming towards you on the beach
>> and and John, you light it up with a
gigantically powerful torch.
>> Yes. And uh with the four there was four
of us out there that night. There was um
we had Donna, we had Sue, um Gerald and
myself. And uh we all had our
hyperspectral cameras, we had the night
vision cameras with us. And um once I
hit the once I hit the object, once I
hit the object with the light, everybody
was able to see these objects. And I I
think Donna can, you know, you you can
attest to that also that uh the light
the object was giving off a reflection.
Um that was
>> my goggles, my IR goggles failed.
Oh, that's right. Her her particular
>> Yeah. During that incident during an
incident with Donna's daughter, three of
three of our
one thing I want to caution is if you
talk over each other, you audio sound
dead in the other person. Can I just get
Donna's account, please?
>> Well, while while John and Jerry were
having this encounter, uh Sue, she's a
registered nurse, and I were prepping
the night crawler for for other uh you
know, other protocols. And we actually
at some point heard a scuffle and we
looked and we saw John and Jerry running
but not fast because they couldn't. It
was beach sand. They were running
through. We were parked right at the
opening of the cut and I knew and so did
Sue that some something had happened.
But we had no idea until John and Jerry
calmed down and told us what had
happened. That something had they had
spotted something in the sky. Something
came out of the water. They both, one
fell, then the other fell temporarily.
They could not move. Then they were able
to get up. They thought maybe this was a
weapon. They weren't sure. So they
wanted to get back to the Nightcrawler.
And so we saw them, you know, we heard
them huffing and puffing. Then we saw
them and we realized that they were
distressed. So something was up. And so
they updated us. And then I don't know,
we spent like maybe 10 minutes, 15
minutes discussing it. And then we all
hight tailed it back to the beach. And
we still saw that formation that those
three points of light, but not with the
eye at all, only with the working
cameras because my my goggles had failed
back at the night crawler for a reason I
don't know why. And then there were
other failures that night. So, uh you
you do get that you get the battery
drains and we did also experience
equipment failure for no other for no
reason.
>> And so, John and Jerry, that's where the
comment was made. You guys were
obviously very upset about what had
happened. You'd been paralyzed and so
that's why you ran like a bunch of
>> Yeah, exactly.
>> pretty. Yeah, I see. Pretty much.
>> So, describe to me describe to me, John
and Jerry, what happened when you were
actually paralyzed presumably by this
object that came towards the beach. It
it's I mean it's not it's not something
even today we can't really wrap our
heads around as far as you know uh what
what what came over us what what it was
that that that produced that effect you
know but it was a physical effect. It
was a was a biological effect. You know,
I tried to as I tried to move away from
it, you know, I had observed a a
rectangular beam of light that was being
um it seemed to reflect my IR
rangefinder on my Luna Lunar Optics uh
night vision. And every one second
flash, I could see this object getting
much closer to our location. Finally, it
overloaded the cameras. the the the
cameras were washed out with with it
looked to me like, you know, the
infrared light. Uh when I pulled the
camera down, I couldn't see anything
other than, you know, just sky. But but
in the cameras, the cameras were
actually overloaded by by some kind of
an infrared radiation, infrared energy.
And as I turned to to move away from the
shore, I I said to my brother, I said I
said, "It's on top of us." And I as I as
I turned, my my legs gave out. I
collapsed. I just collapsed onto the
sand and I couldn't coordinate my legs
to under me to to to pick myself back
up.
>> And this happened to both of you.
>> Yeah, I had when I heard John yell and
then he couldn't get out but he couldn't
move. I I didn't understand it. So I
gra, you know, tried to pull him back up
and he was starting to regain the
strength. It was lasted maybe less than
a minute the effect. Then I collapsed
and I lost all strength and muscle tone
in my legs. Um I couldn't yeah I
couldn't do the same. I couldn't
coordinate my legs underneath. I'd use
my arms to actually pull myself in the
sand. And while this was happening,
there was something happening to our
camera, which it the camera was working
intermittently, but it recorded an
event. It recorded something that
entered the optics
uh some sphere of light that when it got
beyond the iris of the camera, which is
was
>> which is bizarre because the iris the
iris, you know, I I was used to be a
camera technician. And I I I used to
repair these came service these cameras
before before engineering. And um the
intensity of the light, you know, with
the the iris motor, you have you have a
diaphragm in there that closes down. And
it closes down instantly if there's if
there's intense light to protect the
CCD. So it's it's it's a it's a loop
that the gain control that actually
shuts this stuff down and adjust the
light level coming in. This seemed to be
working. The iris motor seemed to be
working, but the the intensity of the
light was beyond it looked like it was
beyond the iris mode when we looked at
the the uh the playback. Uh almost
looked like there was an intense form of
light inside just beyond the iris mode.
>> So, you know what I mean by the sixth
observable? There's a lot of talk that
there's not five observables, there's
six. And the sixth observable is
biological effects. You guys may in fact
have suffered the biological effects of
a UAP. It could be.
>> That's what we Well, that's what we
believe.
>> Yeah. I mean
>> I mean there's no other there's there's
no other cause. I It doesn't even make
sense. The two of us experienced the
same thing. And it wasn't just bio
effects on us.
When we were looking at that object when
that object finally disappeared, there
were two crustaceations on the beach, a
a krill and a and a shrimp. They were
both glowing uh in intense luminosity in
the IR range. And we collected those two
specimens. They were they were a few
feet from where we experienced this
incident and they were supercharged with
this IR energy which makes no sense.
>> What could possibly cause that?
>> Well, well, that's the thing. It wasn't
it wasn't bioluminescence.
Bioluminescence occurs at at a frequency
of 450 to maybe 577 nanometers. That's
in the visible spectrum. These things
were
>> Yeah. the wavelength. These were in the
infrared and and that makes no sense
whatsoever.
>> So, they were dead. These creatures
>> they they were dead and uh we had
brought them back in desecrated. You
said
>> they were Yeah, we brought them back in
a specimen container and I had examined
them under a microscope. They were
desiccated. Both of them had large
openings in their thorax. It looked like
the internal organs of it looked like a
a a thermal expansion effect of of the
insides being bursted out.
So there are so many incidents and I I'm
I'm actually I could keep on going all
day guys, but you know honestly there
are so many incidents in what you've
described and shot in your videos that
there is one that intrigued me though
because it's actually not over the
beach. It's video 36 Hullbrook incident
and you see a huge light over a
backyard. What's that story?
>> Okay, so this is what we think is
another uh uh example of a of a
hitchhiker effect. And this time it was
videotaped on the cameras of the RV.
I'll let John explain.
>> Right. So, we had uh we had gone out
there earlier in the night and um had
returned home at I guess around 1:30 and
I live roughly about 25 minutes from
from the research location at Rob Moses
State Park. So, the vehicle had the
cameras running. There's there's four
different um cameras. They're night
vision cameras, fixed cameras uh on the
on the platform on on the uh RV. And
each one is at different positions. the
passenger side, the drivers, the front
and back. And um they were recording
overnight and within about two hours of
the vehicle being parked, you know, I
had turned in I had turned into bed and
uh we noticed that, you know, the next
day I had checked the the video because
it was giving an indication that it
recorded something. And I checked the
recording and uh it started out with uh
we have three street lights over the
vehicle. Uh one was in front um roughly
about 300 ft ahead. There was a street
light behind the vehicle directly behind
literally over the RV. And there was
another street light on the passenger
side that was probably another maybe 200
feet away from it. And all three street
lights shut down at the same time that
night. And you could see an interference
pattern developing in in the video
cameras. A a almost like a it's a radio
frequency interference of some sort,
electromagnetic interference. And you'd
see on the back of the um the frame
structure of the RV where the camera was
overlooking, you'd see a blue light
appear. And the blue light
uh grew got got brighter and brighter
turned into white light and um uh and it
would just it remained there for a
period of time and then you could see
slowly you could see the street lights
recover one after another very quickly
sequentially and the only thing I can do
that you know the these are I believe
they're sodium vapor lights and they
have on top of the uh top hats on the
these these um hoods of the of the of
the lamps there's a photo sensor And
that photo sensor is designed to uh
sense sunlight in the morning and shut
the lights down. So something in the um
I believe it was in the infrared
spectrum had triggered those those
sensors are also sensitive to the
infrared the near infrared. So it
tripped those sensors and all those all
light those lights shut down at the same
time.
>> Not only were you followed home by
whatever the phenomenon is,
>> it was also not visible. The only reason
you were able to see this is because you
had the cameras that can see in that
infrared spectrum.
>> Exactly.
>> Right. Exactly.
>> And another interesting thing is the
only way you can shut these these these
photo uh sensors down is you that light
has to be above those those hoods. The
hoods. Yeah. I mean the photo sensors
are straight up. They're they're they're
vertical. They're at a zenith to the
sky.
>> Right. Donna. Um, one of the things I'm
interested in is here are you guys off
the coast of Long Island gathering 50 at
least extraordinary videos of anomalous
incidents.
Have there been, and I know there has
been, there's been times where you've
wondered whether somebody else is taking
an interest in what you're recording.
Have there been unknown planes around
the area during the period when you've
been filming? perhaps also taking an
interest in the phenomenon that you're
observing.
>> Uh well, I would say none that we were
really able to identify. Although there
was one day, and this again was back in
August 2022. So that would be the second
month into the phase one study where
John witnessed some extraordinary
activity.
and John and Jerry and I, we had already
reported to the park police and other
local officials, local only, that we had
seen some strange things already in the
sky with IR equipment and did they know
what this could be? And we were looking
into what the drone laws were and and
that uh information. And John saw
some craft in the sky and he saw
search beams
that were focusing on the sky, not on
the ocean. So if it's Coast Guard, you
would be able to get radar hits. If it
was Coast Guard, they would be focusing
on the water. So we thought that that
was very unusual. And we thought, well,
what what timing? The week before we had
went to the park police and and let them
know that we are seeing something that
we have not yet been able to categorize
or identify.
>> John and Jerry, there's one video I'm
interested in, video nine, and it's the
16th of January, 2023, and there appears
to be an unknown plane adjacent to orbs
that you're taking an interest in. Do
you know the one I mean?
>> Is is that that's the uh was that the
tic tac? Yeah, the
>> that might been that might have been the
tic tac video.
>> No, it was a nighttime image and it
seems to be an aircraft that's adjacent
to orbs. So,
>> okay. Yeah, I think I think you're
talking about the aircraft that we had.
We used a 60 time zoom. We zoomed in on
it. It looked like a small dot of light.
We wanted to identify it. So, we at 60
time zoom, we could easily see an
aircraft and its navigation launcher.
So, we saw this aircraft and what we
noticed was about um four four orbs of
light uh almost look like fireballs that
were trailing it and we we had uh
watched to see if the orient if the uh
the aspect ratio would change so we see
maybe the the navigation lights were
hidden but these never showed any
navigation light these lights these four
orbs of light the plane though was very
obvious with the navigation light so
these things we couldn't identify right
and they were seem to be in the flight
path of the plane as So, that's the
thing that interests me about all of
this. Let's let's do a a closer if you
like because I've gone way over time,
but I've been so fascinated by what
you've told me and thank you so much for
sharing it. No problem.
>> What what I find fascinating about all
of this is we are talking about an
extraordinarily sensitive and busy area
of airspace in the continental United
States. It's probably one of the most
busy areas of airspace, both military
and civilian. Do you agree that
categorically what you are recording
raises flight safety and national
security issues?
>> Oh, absolutely. I believe so. There
there there was, you know, there's an
interesting incident that occurred um I
think it was during the 1990s, the
flight 800 uh crash.
>> I covered that story. TWWA 800. Yeah.
They they put the crash down to um kept
wiring arcing inside the fuel tank. I I
did a whole
Right. And that was never determined as
a certainty. That was that was the
educated guess of the uh the n the
national transportation safety board.
But the the the they know that the ex
the explosion that that that that
started the incident started in the
center fuel tank. Now the thing the
interesting thing is that can also
happen from an impact is that there were
there were like maybe 700 witnesses
approximately around that that number
who saw a flash of light heading up
towards the plane. Obviously they told
people that they were uh their can I
tell you boys I'm so pleased you raised
this because I was scared to raise it in
case I sound like a nutty conspiracy
theorist. I covered that story and I
interviewed people about the crash of
TWWA800 and I remember speaking to
people telling me that they saw a flash
of light coming up towards the aircraft
and it was very quickly shut down in the
NT NTSB investigation and there were you
know obviously there was this argument
that it was a problem with very badly
covered wiring. They they didn't have
Teflon coating on the wiring in the
proper way so it cracked and caused an
arc. But yes, there is a question mark
in my mind that this is the area for
where one of the most mysterious
aircraft crashes of all time took place
right in this flight path area and it's
never been properly explained. I I'm I I
I think we should just leave it as an
open question whether there was perhaps
a collision with an anomalous object.
>> It's certainly something that should be
considered as a possibility.
>> Yeah. I mean, it was within within about
seven less than seven miles of of where
we were.
>> And it's out it's out where we're seeing
these objects. And of course, you know,
could could have been a a collision,
maybe even accidental collision. It's
possible.
>> Sure. And I know you guys can't talk
about it because you've been asked not
to, but my own sources in the FBI are
telling me that the feds are taking a
very, very close interest in your work.
And uh I I I know you're talking about a
new phase to your study. What's next?
Are you going to go out on boats? Are
you going to be using drones? What's
what's the next phase of your study?
>> Well, John had summarized it. You could
probably
>> Yeah, we initiated a FA a phase. So, we
actually started, you know, of of
course, you know, you know, this is a
point now in time where, you know, we're
experiencing some funding issues and so
forth, getting getting the RV out there
and getting enough volunteers and so
forth to spend time with it. But, um,
you know, phase two is going to involved
um, which actually has involved already
is remotely operated, uh, hyperspectral
camera systems. So these camera systems
can be visualized or viewed from any
location and they're fully integrated
with a small millimeter wave radar
system,
>> right? And they all they all contain a
millimeter wave radar system which gives
a three mile range in the line of sight
and in the visual range of the cameras.
So as a detecting source um you also the
the cameras can be tracked there's
there's a pan and tilt operation on on
on some models of it. Um but uh they can
be put in areas that we have no access
to or we're not frequented to you know
or or popular areas you know uh maybe
areas that have higher incidences of
these uh sightings and utilized you know
to try to identify the possibility of
whether or not we need to send a
laboratory to that particular location
and do a full full length study. Um,
again, this is, you know, we're also
using extensive use of millimeter wave
radar because we kind of suspect that
what we're getting back on some of these
returns is that there's a delay in the
signal and and and and this is something
like I said, it's been it's been uh it's
been talked about since the 1920s. Uh
we're just wondering why and and we've
had a couple of really interesting radar
anomalies where we would use the
background ships in the background that
were basically 9 12 miles out and use
that as a reference and our returns
would show uh elongated track track
patterns almost like they were being
delayed because we we have a mechanical
circulating radar system. And just
to emphasize the point that you were
making, one possible explanation for
those delays is gravitational lensing.
>> Exactly. Exactly. That's who that's what
we're kind of suspecting this was this
point. So when
>> what would cause gravitational lensing?
Let's take this to its logical
conclusion. Some kind of propulsion
device back.
>> Some kind of propulsion system and and
which correlates we believe with these
odd frequencies that we've been getting
as well,
>> you know. So we're trying to put this
all together as a as a means of
detection of these objects, you know,
using, you know, fixed system
satellites, you know, using GPS locators
and that sort of thing because the same
would happen to any radio signal as well
as light, you know, in the full
electromagnetic spectrum. You know, we
can see the same distortion with LAR.
>> John, Jerry, and Donna, I just want to
take my hat off to you guys. What the
work that you have done is exceptional.
It's it's astonishing and it it
>> it exemplifies everything that I think
all of us want to see in citizen science
trying to validate and investigate the
phenomenon. So, congratulations to you
and I I think I speak for everybody
watching this. You know, we really are
excited by the work that you're doing.
If I can promote or assist in any way in
helping you get further publicity on
this issue, please let me know. I'm I'm
very very excited by the methodical
quality science that you've done here.
I'll be interested to see how the
Splenetic debunkers deal with your work
because you've done some phenomenal
research and my hearty congratulations
to you. I'll get spanked by News Nation
for letting this go on so long. But the
bottom line is I I've loved this
conversation and I want to do it. It's
>> a lot of fun.
>> Keep in we we appreciate all the
support. Yes, it's we're we're we're
very happy to be on your show and
participate in this. This is great.
>> Thank you so much for talking to Reality
Check and we'll have you back on again
soon. Thank you so much.
>> Good day and welcome to a special
edition of Reality Check coming to you
live from Cairo, Egypt. I didn't attend
today's hearing in the Congress for the
House Oversight and Accountability
Committee because I had a prior
engagement to be a host of a tour of
Egypt's ancient ruins. And it's a very
fascinating trip. I have to say I'm
really enjoying the experience. And
there is a definitive connection to the
UAP mystery because just like the UAP
mystery, the issue of the ancient
technologies, the mystery of the ancient
technologies of the ancient ruins of
Egypt uh are in plain sight and they
pose a conundrum, an inexplicable
conundrum. Who the hell built them? And
just like the UFO issue, there's a hell
of a lot of evidence that everybody's
been ignoring and sticking their head in
the sands on. Coming to today's hearing,
well, I wouldn't say it was
groundbreaking. I wouldn't say it was
momentous, but boy, there was something
special about I think a shift in the
room. I think there was a sense of
change in the determination and the
attitude of the Congress. It's quite
clear that a number of congressmen,
congressw women are determined to get to
the bottom of this UAP issue. And let's
put today's hearing in context before we
get into the nitty-gritty gritty detail
of the hearing. Let's put in context
that President elect Trump has announced
John Ratcliffe, the former director of
national intelligence, as his new head
of the CIA. And Ratcliffe has been
extremely outspoken on the subject of
UAPs. He's indicated very strongly that
he thinks that there needs to be greater
transparency and accountability. And
just in the last few minutes, I've heard
that uh Tulsi Gubbed from Colorado, the
representative from Colorado, has been
chosen by President Trump to be the
director of national intelligence.
That's quite a a momentous turn of
events. I I can imagine there are people
in the defense department and the CIA,
the CIA Office of Global Access in
particular, who are quaking in their
boots, turning on the shredders getting
ready for the imminent possibility of
demands by the Congress for information.
I mean, I I think the um the the simple
fact is that we're in a a position where
the maintaining of the status quo by
those who keep on wishing to keep this
secret is no longer sustainable. Um I I
get the impression that um uh not only
are Congress congressional
representatives getting frustrated and
impatient, they are they are actually at
the point now where they're determined
to get access to information. Um what
did I think of the speakers today? Look,
um I didn't hear anything new. Uh I I I
do think that frankly uh uh the the
issue will always be with the Serverise
and Accountability Committee public
hearings that nothing can be discussed
that hasn't been preapproved in a DOPSA
in a defense office pre-publication
security review. And um in this case,
you know, a lot of people are saying
online they're very frustrated that
there's been no more revelations from
Lou Alzando in particular, but the guy
is constrained by his Dopps. He's not
allowed to reveal anything that he's not
authorized to reveal. Otherwise, that
puts him in breach of his security oath.
Um just uh letting my producer Alex know
that if we are showing private chat
comments, I'm not getting any at the
moment. Um, I'm just having a look. Give
me 5 seconds. Ah, now I'm having a look.
Now I'm getting some.
So, um, let me quickly have a look at
what you guys are asking.
When is this thing to space supposed to
go to air? The Earth is bigger than we
know. Alzando is a shill like grush. Oh,
go away you boring I can't be
bothered with people who are insulting
to people who are patriots. Uh I I I
just don't think people realize the
depth and the level of the commitment
that these people
>> Are you read into secret UAP?
>> So that's an interview uh sorry that's
an exchange with Lou Alzando that my
colleague Alex has just put on the
screen. Let's have a listen to this.
This is one of the excerpts from Lou's
testimony today.
>> Okay.
>> Are you read into secret UAP crash
retrieval programs? Um, we would have to
have a conversation in a close session.
Ma'am, I signed documentation three
years ago that restricts my ability to
discuss specifically crash retrievalss.
Um, I submitted for my book through the
Doppser process, which took a year for
it to be reviewed. And what is in the
book is what I was told I'm allowed to
talk about.
>> Now, that I think even though Lou didn't
answer it, is probably the most
momentous question and answer of the
evening. Think about it. Why can't Lou
Alzando ask the qu answer the question,
was he read into a program involving
crash retrievals?
If he can't answer it, if he could
answer it, he'd probably say no.
If he can't answer it, it probably means
he'd have to say yes.
And my bet is that Lu Lzando was read
into a legacy retrieval program. I think
you should just ponder the significance
of that for a moment. Why would Lu
Lzando be read into a retrieval program?
There was another uh moment I think it
was Jared Moscowitz asked Alzando
what his most previous role was in the
defense department and it was a long-
winded title. I guess a lot of people
might have missed it but essentially he
was involved in the management of an SAP
and did you notice that it was at White
House level? Just have a think about
that. This is a person who who a lot of
people keep on dismissing in a really I
think quite disgraceful way. Lou is a
patriot. He's somebody who's sticking
his neck out for you to get the truth
and to get oversight by the Congress.
And frankly, I I don't think he deserves
to be treated with disrespect. Um let me
get on to some of these more of these
questions. Um
somebody says here, "I'm not really sure
what gold brought to the table today.
seemed like an opportunistic move to get
more funding for NASA. That's surfing
Steven. Look, yeah, I found I find of
all of the speakers, I find Michael Gold
the most underwhelming in terms of the
information that he actually had to
offer. But what I thought was the most
interesting thing that he said is that
there is an extensive archive that could
be drawn upon inside NASA that would
allow more insights to be obtained about
UAPs.
And that's to me an extraordinarily
important point to make because
NASA is an extraordinarily
well-resourced organization that has
deep space assets. It's got um long
range cameras. It's got assets that are
being deployed both looking out towards
space and back in towards the Earth. And
if the allegations contained in the
Immaculate Constellation document are
all true, and I strongly suspect they
are, then frankly the implications are
that we're picking up things on our
space sensor systems that are
extraordinarily important. And all that
is needed is a change of attitude inside
NASA to start taking this issue
seriously. And I I think that's the
significance of today's hearing that
that you're now seeing I think a kind of
a shift in the room. People are now
engaging in a way of data much of which
I believe will likely have information
that will
>> this is Michael Gold. He's the u former
member of the NASA team that
investigated the uh the UAP issue. And
frankly, I think they did a bit of a wet
lettuce of a report. But just here, have
a quick listen to what Michael Gold
said.
help inform UAP. We need only look and
again in an era with AI and ML, we can
relatively quickly and easily go through
it. So I think it's something that we
should encourage NASA to do.
I I I think NASA actually is a key to a
lot of this. I I personally believe from
my own sources that NASA or at least
individuals in NASA are colluding to
stop the public from knowing about
things that are seen by their space
sensor systems. Um I've actually seen it
myself. I had a visit to a space center
in the course of this year and in the
course of our visit um I was with
someone who who knew NASA very very well
and we were being given a VIP tour of a
NASA facility and in the course of that
tour we were looking at imagery from the
space station looking out towards outer
space and in the course of our
conversation with a very senior official
from NASA a number of eggshaped objects
drifted into view and I asked them. I
thought, "Oh, that must be the Starlink.
It must be Starlink satellites that have
recently been deployed." And I said,
"Oh, are they Starling satellites?" And
the person turned and looked very, very
surprised and uh said, "No, they're
not." Then he looked across to the
control room and they flicked a switch
and it immediately went to transmission
to the space station has been
interrupted. I I can't say definitively
what those objects were, but I think I
maybe have seen NASA turning off the
switch. Um, let me have a look here. Um,
>> hey Ross, this is your producer
Alexandra. Um, I've got a couple of
questions for you if you're ready for
me.
>> Sure. Far away.
>> Yeah. I think, um, a lot of people are
asking right now, what is the next step?
>> Okay. Well, that's a good starting
point. Look, today's hearing, I think,
was window dressing. It was uh an
opportunity, I think, for the
representatives in the lower house to
basically have their moment in the sun.
And good on Nancy Mace. I I I think
she's been fantastic. She showed fire in
uh in demonstrating her willingness to
engage on this issue. That to me is the
most important thing about this, that
we've now got representatives that have
got the bit between the teeth. They've
got red meat and they're ready to fire
on it. And that's that's significant.
What's going to happen now? I think we
should be watching what's coming up next
in the Senate because Senator Gillibrand
has indicated very strongly that she
thinks she wants a hearing uh after the
election, post election. Um I heard the
rumor that it might be as early as late
November. And uh I think a hearing of
her subcommittee of the Senate
Intelligence Committee could very well
be I think a a moment a momentous
change. Uh that's what I think comes
next. Um I'm working on something at the
moment that will be coming to air in
sometime hopefully towards the end of
this year that I hope will be making a
significant contribution. Um I'd like to
see also further delving into the
allegations raised in the immaculate
constellation report. Um, having seen
the report now, it's been tabled and,
uh, a copy of it has been posted by
Nancy Mace. Uh, and what's really
interesting about that report to me is
that it was vetted and approved for
release not by the defense department,
but by the Department of State. And that
told me something. it it indicated to me
for the first time something I've
suspected for a while that the source uh
is somebody I think I'm aware of uh who
operates in a particular government
department that may or may not be the
department of state. So, um I think if
that's the case, it's extraordinarily
significant and important and um I would
like to see those allegations in the
Immaculate Constellation report fully
investigated. Whoever's put that report
together has done a lot of information
dumping. There are even file numbers
that would allow any proactive searcher
to go and find the files that they are
referring to. That is extremely
important and I strongly suspect that
that person having been deposed in a
hearing having provided that evidence to
the uh Congress I strongly suspect that
that person has given much much much
more detail in private hearing. Just so
you know I'm I'm aware of individuals
who have given evidence particularly to
the Senate Intelligence Committee.
There's been a hell of a lot happening
behind the scenes in the last few
months. And I'm sorry, I know people get
frustrated about this. The simple fact
is that a lot of this evidence has to be
given in a secure skiff because these
people are patriots. They're national
security constrained employees often of
the defense department, former or
serving, and they don't want to breach
their security oath. But the interesting
thing is legally these committees,
particularly the Senate Intelligence
Committee, are allowed to hear their
evidence in a secure room, a skiff, a
secure facility that allows the evidence
to be heard with all the legal and u
secrecy protections and I know for a
fact that people have testified before
the Congress and particularly to the
Senate Intelligence Committee. Uh let's
have a look any more questions. I'm just
scrolling forward on an enormous list of
questions that I've got here in front of
me. Are there any that you think we
should be focusing on, Alex?
>> Yes. Uh, Ross, our team here at
NewsNation was talking about Alzando's
comments about seeing biologics from
before he was born. I see some other
people are asking about that, too.
Wondering if that could potentially be
some type of connection to Roswell.
>> Ah, well, that's speculative. I don't
know for sure. Um, but, uh, Lou is, and
he's acknowledged this to me in the
interview that he did for News Nation.
he is an experiencer and um I know that
he's had things that he doesn't want to
talk about publicly happen to him and um
so have interestingly enough a lot of
the people who've been involved in
investigating the UAP issue. Um the the
simple fact is that
um uh something is taking an interest in
the people who are investigating it and
that includes not just government
officials but frankly I think anyone who
engages with the phenomenon. There is
this thing called the hitchhiker
phenomenon. Uh talking of biologics by
the way did anyone catch the craziest
question of the evening? And I'm not
saying that in a pjorative way. um the
claims made by uh Congresswoman Lauren
Bobett from uh Colorado and she asked,
"There are rumors that have come up to
the hill of a secretive project within
the DoD involving the manipulation of
human genetics with what is described as
nonhuman genetic material potentially
for the enhancement of human
capabilities in hybrids. Are any of you
familiar with that?" Yes or no? No.
Nobody gave her any kind of wow answer.
But that is one hell of an allegation
that this is a an allegation that has
come to the attention uh of the hill of
the congress. Watch that space.
Um now anything more Alex that I should
know about? I'm finding it very hard to
monitor what the comments are.
>> Yes, we're getting a lot of comments
here. Somebody is asking the importance
of the documents submitted.
>> Oh, okay. So, this document, the
immaculate constellation document is not
an official government document. That's
been a misnomer. A lot of people have
thought that this was some kind of top
secret compartmentalized document. It is
a summary by someone I think I know know
now that I know that they um had the
clearance done by the Department of
State. Um and I think that that what
they have done is a summary of documents
that they became privy to in the course
of their work. There are a lot of people
who have contacted me and other
journalists including my friend and
colleague Michael Shelonburgger who are
aware of tangential issues relating to
the program because of the degree of
access they've had in the course of
their job. And some of them are too
frightened to talk about what they've
heard because look, to be honest with
you, they're patriots. They don't want
to jeopardize inadvertently by speaking
out about something, some kind of
program that they're frightened of
speaking about because it might actually
compromise sources or, you know, human
intelligence or methods and um means by
which we obtain this intelligence. And
that's something that we have to be
mindful of. Um I I do think we need to
be respectful of people for why they
decide not to speak about something. Um
so just to emphasize the immaculate
constellation document is not an
official government document but the do
the information within it I recognize a
lot of the names and terms and sensor
systems that that are described by that
person. they are extremely wellinformed
and uh if they are the person that I now
think I know who they are then they
deserve to be protected and they must be
listened to. Um I'm just looking at a
question here that somebody's asked
asked me and I think it's an important
question. Ross, do you think there is
some sort of fight between the
government and private technology
contractors about that UAP technology?
Bloody hell I do. Absolutely there is.
What's going on at the moment, and I
know this is going on, is you've got the
CIA, Office of Global Access, is running
a counter disinformation operation to
try and stop you, the public, from
knowing about this issue. We are now
very very close to this spilling. Um
there are a lot of people coming forward
to me and others saying what they know
and they're very very willing to testify
certainly in camera to the Congress
particularly to the Senate Intelligence
Committee. um speaking in public might
not be at this stage a really good idea
because frankly if they do try and speak
in public they they get constrained by
the national security oath that limits
what they can reveal within the
compartmented information that they're
allowed to discuss that's been approved
by say a DOPSer application what's
really significant about the Immaculate
Constellation document is that it was
not approved by the Department of
Defense and I just wonder if they've
been wrongfooted As I understand it,
when you do a DOPSA uh request, when
you're asking for permission to to speak
and make an application to the Defense
Office of Pre-Publication Security
Review, the equivalent in the State
Department, I don't know what its
systems are, but I presume it does what
the Defense Department does, which is
write to the affected agencies and ask
them whether they have any objections to
the release of this information and it's
really interesting that in the
immaculate constellation document
certain sensor systems capabilities have
been revealed. I'm told they are
particularly accurate. Um I can't speak
to all of the document because frankly
I'm just not across the detail of all of
it. Um a lot of people I notice it's
becoming very fashionable to take a kick
at Lua Lzando on the way through. I have
absolutely no time for those people.
They have no understanding of the
sacrifices that a patriot like Lou
Alzando is making. Um it's becoming a
bit of a boore, frankly, that people
feel that they can give a kicking to
Lou. And I think all they're doing,
frankly, is playing to the trolls who
have been played by disinformation
operatives within the defense
department, notably Susan Goff, who are
basically trying to shut down public
commentary on this issue by running a
diversion operation on Lu Alzando. Don't
buy it, guys. Really, don't buy it. You
know, you are being fooled. You are
deliberately being misled so that you
get off the trail. It's absolutely
imperative that you keep the heat up on
these buggers because if you don't,
they're going to cover it up again.
There is still, I think, a serious
possibility that even with the pressure
that's coming from Congress under Trump,
even with a DNI like John Ratcliffe and
um not not a DNI, a CIA director like
John Ratcliffe and an a DNI like Tulsi
Gabbar, there's still a possibility that
Trump might be intimidated by forces
within the defense and intelligence
community who impress upon him, as they
have done with other presidents, why
this information should not be released.
We've got to keep the heat up. Whatever
the information is, as I think it was
Louis Lzando said, no, it was Michael
Shelonburgger. Michael Shelonburgger
gave a great quote that I think I might
get Alex to run where he basically
talked about the the fact that the
public has a right to know this. Let's
have a listen to Michael Shelonburgger.
You got that one for us, Alex?
>> UATP task force. This is completely
absurd. It's nuts. this level of of
censorship of redaction on a document.
It shows the redaction of how many
reports they've collected for how many
years. Two of the three potential
explanations are blacked out. The
Pentagon,
the intelligence community is treating
us like children. It's time for us to
know the truth about this. I think that
we can handle it.
>> We can handle the truth. Uh, one of the
questions that I noticed somebody has
asked in the uh, questions is Ross, can
you reveal the large UAP building to
Shelonburgger so that he can go
anonymous?
It's a funny question. I can't reveal it
to Michael Shelonburgger, but I have
revealed it to people who are in a
position to have the clearances to be
allowed to know. Uh, and that has been
done. Uh, that's all I'm going to say.
Uh there are people who are in a
position to investigate this and I know
that they're in possession of the
information and I know that they're
investigating it.
>> Hey Ross, this is Alexandra again. A few
people on here are asking about David
Grush and why he wasn't at the hearing
today. Okay, look, frankly, again, with
David Grush, um, if David had been
called in a public hearing before the
House Oversight and Accountability
Committee, most of the time he would
have had to have done what Lou had to
do, which is say, "I'm really sorry, I
can't answer that question." Um, David's
trying to get approvals for further
information to be revealed in his new
DOPS applications. Um uh a lot of people
see that there's something sinister in
dosser allegation dopser applications
they think that somehow because he's
making applications to the defense
department to get permission to talk
about things that that's somehow some
kind of game where the defense
department is playing David. Not true.
The simple fact is David's only allowed
to reveal publicly in a public hearing
forum like the House Oversight and
Accountability Committee what he's
allowed to reveal. He can reveal I mean
technically legally David in a secure
skiff can go into the Senate
Intelligence Committee as he has done
and reveal all I don't mean to be
disrespectful to the people watching
this but you guys are largely irrelevant
to the processes of oversight and and
accountability in the Congress. The
Congress has checks and balances on
executive power. And because of the
nature of the intelligence community and
the secrets that have to be protected,
we do have to protect human sources. We
do have to protect sources and methods.
And as a professional journalist, I am
legally obliged, ethically obliged to
protect that as well.
But David can and has done testify in
camera to the Senate Intelligence
Committee and he has given hours and
hours and hours of evidence where he has
quite literally detailed where craft are
being hidden, who are hiding those
craft, the code names of the programs
that are being used to conceal those
craft. That detail has been provided to
the Senate Intelligence Committee. So,
if you've got frustration, if you're
really angry about why nothing's
proceeding with this, you should be
asking your congressional
representatives in both the House
Oversight Committee, um the House
Intelligence Committee, the Senate
Intelligence Committee, the Senate Armed
Services Committee, the House Armed
Services Committee. It's those
representatives in the Senate and the
House who know the information that has
been provided by David Grush and other
witnesses in camera where they're
legally allowed to do that. And you
should be asking the question of them,
why aren't you doing something with the
information that we know has been
provided in camera? David Grush has said
he's provided, I think, 14 hours or 11
hours of evidence. He's provided an
enormous amount of information. He's not
legally allowed to reveal all in a
public way that would allow uh potential
adversaries, Russia, China from getting
any kind of strategic advantage. And
there are good reasons for doing that.
Let me know if you've got any other
questions, Alex. Um I'm just pro um
going on down.
>> Yeah, Ross, this is Alex again. A few
people have asked where to watch the UAP
hearing from this morning. Um,
NewsNation did stream that on our
YouTube page. So, if you head over to
NewsNation YouTube, um, you can find
that under um, live replays. Uh, and
that's also where you'll be able to
find, uh, this live replay once we're
chatting here today.
>> Sure. Don't forget also a lot of people
are are asking, you know, where do we go
from here? You know, what what what came
out of today? Why was it significant? To
me, what was significant was that Lou
Alzando was able to give evidence under
oath.
He's told the Congress under oath. He's
subject now to criminal penalties if he
has lied, knowingly lied. He's told them
that he is aware of the existence of a
UAP craft retrieval program and reverse
engineering program.
Now, that is exactly what David Grush
testified to. That's extraordinarily
significant. You now have two people
with extremely detailed alleged
knowledge of this program testifying to
the Congress under oath that they are
aware of the existence of such a
program. Um, that's what Congress needs
to start now properly investigating.
Um,
I'm just scrolling down.
A lot of people here are making
insinuations about Michael Gold being a
plant. That's not the case at all. I
thought Michael Gold's enthusiasm for
the UAP subject was commendable. He's,
you know, he's somebody we should be
grateful for anyone who's prepared to
stick their head up above the parapit
and prepared to say, "Yeah, I'm a public
official. I'm I'm a public servant. I've
got security clearances and I'm prepared
to say I think that this should be
investigated and this is where you can
find this evidence." That's what Michael
Gold was doing. Good on him for speaking
about it.
um he wasn't hugely, you know,
overwhelming in what he revealed, but I
still think that it was significant that
he was prepared to testify.
I do agree here somebody Luna Castle
saying gold wasn't asked the questions
regarding NASA's UAP report that he
should have been, namely, were any
conclusions suppressed or was access to
relevant data blocked for any reason.
That is one very well-informed point. I
thought NASA report was just a piece of
limp lettuce. it was a joke and uh you
know I know for a fact that NASA's
sitting on evidence that it it knows
relates to the UAP subject. It may be
that not everybody at a very senior
level in NASA knows about it but there
are certainly gatekeepers for the legacy
program who are operating and in stealth
inside NASA monitoring what's being seen
and making sure that the um the UAP
program gets to know about it. You know
the interesting thing is um I've spoken
to very senior people in NASA uh both in
a former and serving capacity who tell
me that they are completely unaware of
any kind of UAP legacy program. They
haven't been briefed into it. And you
would think that they would have been,
but the interesting thing is my sources
tell me that two rungs below that very
senior person,
that person's a gatekeeper controlling
the flow of information on UAPs. That's
how they do this. Um, and I just think
that's outrageous. You know, why, for
example, couldn't a very senior person
in NASA know about the existence of a
non-human intelligence? Isn't that
directly relevant to the expenditure of
billions, if not trillions of taxpayer
dollars?
Oh, boring. Alzando is a counter
intelligence operative. Yeah, Alzando is
a trained counter intelligence
operative, but the person who wrote that
is smartly insinuating that he's trying
to dissemble and disinform. Grow up.
Um, we need firstirhand witness
testimony. Bring in the executives from
Lockheed, Boeing, Honeywell, Northrup,
Grumman, General is it General Dynamics.
Absolutely. I completely agree with
David who's made that point. We do need
to put these people under oath. And I've
forgotten who it was. It might have been
um Nancy Mace who suggested that it was
time for people to be subpoenaed,
potentially hostile witnesses to be
called before the Congress and put under
oath and asked the hard question.
Another person I'd add to that list is
Admiral Thomas Wilson, retired, the man
who received the uh alleged Wilson Davis
memo, who has so far denied the uh
accuracy of its contents. I'd like to
see him put under oath and see if he's
prepared to lie and commit perjury and
deceive the American public. I think
that would be a very interesting Q&A.
Um,
are aliens going to kill anyone? No, I
don't think that's true at all. I don't
see any indication at all of any
malevolence from what I hear from
people. Somebody says here, I was a bit
disheartened after this. It seemed to
falter. I agree. It lost puff halfway
through. Um, but they're making the
point that um, and this is M1. Hearing
about Gabbard being appointed will
hopefully put their feet to the fire. I
totally agree. I mean, it's pretty cool.
I mean, whatever you think of Donald
Trump, the fact that he's appointing
these people who are so definitively
pro- UAP disclosure to key positions
like the CIA director and the director
of national intelligence is going to put
the not just the wind of change, it's
going to put the blowtorrch of change
through the complacent
I I I can't say what I want to say
because I am so angry with these people.
I might swear and I know you Americans
don't like cussing. I I am so angry
about the arrogant hubristic jerks that
are controlling access to this
information. My understanding is that
they're relying on the legal
executive order dating back to I think
either 1952 or 1954 under Eisenhower.
The same Eisenhower who warned about the
threat of the growing power of the
military-industrial complex. Um, I don't
think, and I'm not offering a firm legal
opinion on this. I'm offering this in
without prejudice, but I don't think you
can plausibly argue that a president can
constrain other presidents from being
told the truth about a nonhuman
intelligence engaging with this planet.
And that's what we're talking about
here. Both um Bill Clinton, former
President Clinton and Barack Obama have
basically said that they were told that
Roswell was not the crash of an alien
spacecraft. I know that is a lie.
Whoever told those two presidents that
has lied and I think those people one
day should be hauled before these
congressional committees and made to
answer for their actions. And if they
have knowingly committed a lie to the
commanderin-chief of the United States,
I think they should be prosecuted and
criminally charged with treason.
And you know what? I wouldn't be
surprised if Donald Trump was thinking
along those lines. I hope he is. Maybe
that might scare these people into being
a little more forthcoming.
Uh, I'm scrolling down. Anything I need
to know, Alex, at your end? I'm trying
to catch up and read while I'm while I'm
talking.
>> No, Ross, it looks like you've answered
most of the questions. Obviously, we're
getting thousands at this point. Um, but
I think anything that's popped up,
you've pretty much addressed. Um,
you'd like to wrap up.
>> J of B. Ross, how important was it that
Lou was able to get the fact that UAP
have affected our nuclear weapons onto
the record? It was extremely important,
but obviously it's already a matter of
public record. Um, are some of the UAPs
people are seeing possibly living
biological systems? Oo, that's a very
interesting question.
If you look at the jellyfish UFO, what
the hell is that? And if you read, by
the way, read the Immaculate
Constellation document and you will see
a very detailed report, da about the
jellyfish UFO. Interesting. A lot of
people were pouring, how does one say
this politely? They were pouring shade
on the jellyfish UFO video, but um there
is a jellyfish UFO video described on
the border between the US and Mexico,
which was I think picked up by a
surveillance aircraft, and it is quite
clearly described in the Immaculate
Constellation document. Um I think that
deserves further investigation.
Um, here's Eduardo saying, "I hope Trump
fires those people making the
whistleblowers look bad and lie to the
public." I'm with you, Eduardo. The
people who are helping us reveal this
secret are patriots. One day, there is
going to be a reckoning, and I think I'm
beginning to think it's going to come a
lot sooner than we all expected because
of what's happening with um, uh,
President-elect Trump making these key
appointments. I'm getting more and more
optimistic as the week goes on. There
really are some momentous appointments.
I'm just going to have a look at a
couple more questions and if I can't see
anything here, I might call it a night.
Yeah. No. Um
Oh, Ross, I'm curious. Have you legit?
This is Jimmy's asking, have you
legitimized the source that there's a
UAP building
uh with Google Earth imagery or a
personal visit? I haven't done a
personal visit, but yes, I have seen
satellite imagery and moreover, I have
independently corroborated the accuracy
of what I'm alleging with multiple
sources. I'm in no doubt about it, guys.
Um,
yeah, I think we can call it. Um, uh, I
I thank you all for taking part in this
live Q&A. Um my summary is uh I don't
think this was a groundbreaking evening
or morning, but I do think that it was a
um an event that shows that the Congress
has got steely resolve. They've got the
bit between their teeth and they're
determined to keep on asking the
questions. What's up next? The Senate is
possibly or actually we're told it's
definitely having a hearing. And after
that, well, one of the things that was
flagged by Michael Gold, I noticed, was
that he's participated in a film that a
producer by the name of Dan Farah is
making, and he named himself Michael
Gold, Lu Lzando, and 30 other senior
officials as being involved in that
film. Now that Michael's talked about
it, I'm going to talk about it. I'm
aware of that film. I'm very excited
about it. I'm told there are some
extremely senior figures, including
former, very senior government
officials, making quite extraordinarily
declaratory statements about an NHI
presence on this planet. Thank you very
much for joining me on Reality Check. I
look forward to talking to you soon.
