Good day and welcome back to Reality
Check Q&A. After my little absence
trottting around South America and the
deep remote parts of the Pacific, I was
desperately trying to persuade my
reality check editors to allow me to
become the Rapanui Easter Island
correspondent for NewsNation, but they
saw right through me, didn't they,
Megan? They they politely declined and
told me to come back to work here in
Australia to answer all of your viewer
questions. Good day, Megan. How are you?
>> Hi, Ross. I'm happy to see you back in
the chair.
>> Nice to be back here. Nice to be back
here. And what a busy time. Goodness
gracious me. Is there going to be
disclosure? Is Mr. Trump going to make
an announcement? I have a funny feeling
it's all going to be a bit of a big
yawn. But let's give it a go, Megan, and
answer some of these viewer questions
about that.
>> That sounds good to me, Ross. We have a
lot of people who are wondering where
you were. So, I guess we will start with
your trip. We've got a post on X from
Gonzalo. He says, "After visiting the
tridactyl corpses and seeing the
problems the researchers at the
University of Eeka face with the
Peruvian government, do you notice how
similar it is to the issues in the US
disclosure effort except for there the
conflict is over physical evidence, not
whistleblowers?"
>> Okay, Gonzalo, let me be very clear. At
first, um, I was very, very skeptical
about the so-called tridactyl beings,
objects being real beings, because like
a lot of people, I'd swallowed
particularly the Reuters news report,
which suggested that there were
artificial toys, hoax objects that had
been intercepted at an airport on their
way out of Peru. and it put a stink over
the whole thing that quite frankly
suggested to me remotely that there was
something very smelly or suspicious
about these objects. Having seen them
for myself, I can't reach at this stage
a definitive conclusion. But what I can
tell my viewers and listeners is I do
not think these are hoax objects. I do
not think that they are some kind of
constructed artificial object. The scans
and indeed the visual inspections that
we were allowed to do in three separate
locations of three separate groups of
beings blew me away. Frankly, they are
real, whatever they are. Uh what needs
to be done and this is what we're hoping
we can do with the story that we will be
airing is find scientific researchers
who are rigorously independent and
determined to do the quality DNA and
other forensics testing that allows us
to confirm the already independently
researched findings that have been done
by US, Mexican, and Peruvian scientists,
suggesting there is indeed something
anomalous about these objects. And yes,
I do agree there is a similarity to the
way that the issue has been, how does
one say this? Sciopt disinformed. I have
no doubt at all that someone along the
way has been putting down poison for the
tridactyl story. I was as fooled as
everyone else. I'm not saying
definitively that they are alien beings
or indeed anything anomalous, but I
certainly agree that we've got over a
probitative hurdle, which means that
they should be properly rigorously
investigated. They deserve full
scientific investigation. And I'm in no
doubt whatsoever about the credibility,
the authenticity, and the sincerity of
the scientists that we met in IKEA,
Lemur, and Kusco. All of whom are
desperate to have the research that
they've done verified and independently
reviewed by some of the world's top
scientists. Um, I just wish the US
showed as much openmindedness about the
issue uh on other issues. uh with the
the subjects of UAP in the United
States. I can tell you that there are
good scientists in South America that
genuinely want this issue investigated.
They're not bludgeoning me or any other
researcher to reach a conclusion. What
they want is independent, verified,
peerreview research. By golly, that's
what we're going to try and help them
get. They deserve it. I I think they're
authentic and credible people. Let's see
whether the objects that they've got uh
can be prosaically explained or are they
as the evidence perhaps perhaps suggests
are they evidence of some perhaps
prehuman advanced technology
civilization or are they evidence of
some ev some civilization that existed
contiguously with humans which went
largely undiscovered. Some of the
evidence suggests they might have lived
through to as late as 800 AD, but some
of the evidence also suggests that they
may be as old as 13,000 plus years. It
is mindblowing. And I can tell you,
Megan, and dear Reality Check viewers,
it blew me away to hold those incredible
objects in my hands and look at the
complexity of their construction. They
are no way artificial objects. They are
not toys. They're not hoaxes. Whatever
they are, they're real and they need
investigation.
>> Well, we look forward to bringing
everybody four plus episodes of your
entire trip. Um,
>> maybe more. Maybe more.
>> Well, we're going to move on to another
huge story that happened while you were
gone. Age of Disclosure. It came out.
People are seeing it. We've got a
question on X from guitar and Jits.
Please ask him about Marco Rubio's
latest comments on the age of disclosure
from the Fox Handy interview with Marco
Rubio. His comments don't inspire any
confidence.
>> I agree. I mean, I think frankly uh
it's clear Marco Rubio in his interview
with Sean Hannity has acknowledged that
the interview was done he said three or
four years ago. That's not true. It was
about two years ago. My understanding is
it was the winter of 2023.
Um he knew full well what he was saying
and I'm told by people close to the
project that um uh he was fully aware of
the edits and how his views were being
represented. Uh it's perhaps unfortunate
that now that he's the acting national
security adviser as well as the
secretary of state I would find it very
hard to believe that Marco Rubio has not
been briefed readin i.e security briefed
into the legacy program. If he hasn't
been then that's another reason why the
Trump administration needs to take the
so-called deep state very very seriously
indeed.
I I was I was actually frustrated, I'll
be honest, with Sean Hennity's interview
because I was waiting for him to ask
Marco Rubio as acting national security
adviser, "Have you been briefed? Have
you been read in or told anything about
the UAP legacy program?" U uh what's his
name? Brett Bayer on Fox did an
excellent interview recently where he
went into some of the detail with um
Dave Grush about uh what Dave allegedly
discovered uh during his research into
the legacy program. There was an open
opportunity there for Fox to basically
ask the question which is Mr. Acting
National Security Adviser, Mr. the guy
who advises the president on national
security. Have you been briefed on UAPs?
And of course, we didn't get that
question asked. So, we didn't get that
answer. And it worries me because there
was the usual kind of nervous titter
that happens whenever questions get
asked about UAPs. And I don't know why
that's the case. The thing that got most
people excited about Marco Rubio's um
statements was that uh Michael
Shelonburgger, a friend of this show and
a friend of mine, did a very good piece
where he interviewed an anonymous senior
advisor to Marco Rubio who quotedly was
quoted as saying, "We are headed towards
massive disclosure."
Now, he didn't say who this adviser was.
Uh, it's not clear whether that
statement was authorized by Marco Rubio,
but I I have to be honest, I'm not
seeing even a whiff, a scaric, a hint of
anything coming from the Trump
administration on any imminent
disclosure. Uh, I don't think they're
actively avoiding the issue. The way
it's been explained to me, they've just
been overwhelmed in the first six to
eight months of their administration
with dealing with what they've had to
deal with. the Middle East, Ukraine, the
economy, uh, everything else that the
Trump administration's had on its plate,
maybe the subject of the biggest story
in human history, the greatest secret
that mankind has ever known has perhaps
been relegated to a lower priority. I
have no idea why. If I was Donald Trump
or Marco Rubio, the first thing I would
do when I got into office was bring in
the head of the DIA, the head of the
CIA's science and technology department,
and I would say, "You gentlemen will be
tried for treason if you don't tell me
the truth right now about UAPs. What do
we have? What do we know? And why
haven't we told the American public
about it?" And if they haven't asked
that question, that is a dereliction of
their responsibility as officers of
executive government that are entrusted
by the American people to protect the
American Constitution. Because
fundamentally at the heart of all of
this, Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, every
other member of the administration knows
that it is an article of the US
Constitution that requires that Congress
be informed about any expenditure that
has been done in its name. And if it's
true that there's been billions, perhaps
trillions of dollars expended on a
legacy UAP retrieval and reverse
engineering program, even if a president
has issued an executive order or a peed
a presidential emergency action
directive, that does not excuse the
obligation to notify Congress. And if
Marco Rubio has not asked the question
as acting national security adviser
about the legacy program, he bloody well
should be because this is the biggest
story in human history and the public
have a right to know.
>> Ross, I totally agree and I'm not one to
start a fight with Sean Hannity, but I
have the transcript in front of me and I
just want to point out one thing that I
would love to hear you touch on. The
very first question of the interview is
I want to start this out with a fun
question. So, it's just confusing to me.
Is the mainstream media starting to take
this topic seriously or do they still
need to kind of make a joke out of it
before they even start discussing it
with somebody like Marco Rubio?
>> That's what irritates me about this
whole subject. Why is it a fun question
when, as the age of disclosure
demonstrated, people like James Clapper,
people like Jay Stratton, um they've got
on the record, highly credible,
authentic, former senior government
officials. I think Jay's got the uh the
status of a vice admiral from his
civilian position as the head of the UAP
task force. This is not some
inconsequential role. These are people
saying they have in Jay's case direct
knowledge of the legacy retrieval and
reverse engineering program. Why? I I
don't want to buy a fight with Fox or
Sean Hannity. I I I actually quite like
a lot of the work that Fox has done
recently, but why be so flippant about a
subject that is so important? Why invite
the interviewe Marco Rubio to treat this
as a fun question? Why is it a fun
question? Why aren't we at the stage now
where when the age of disclosure movie
makes incredibly clear serious credible
people are saying this is a real
subject, an authentic subject for
investigation? Why invite such
flippency? I I I don't understand. I I
completely agree with you, Megan. It it
makes no sense to me that we would
invite an interviewee just to treat this
as a joke question.
Well, we would love to have him on. So,
open invitation for Marco Rubio for you.
>> Absolutely. I I would love to get him
on. And the first question I would ask
him is the question that should have
been asked, which is, Mr. Secretary of
State, Mr. Acting National Security
Adviser, you've been in office now for 9
10 months.
have you sought and received any
information at all on the legacy UAP
retrieval reverse engineering program?
And if his answer was no, I'd say why
not? Why not? And it does make me
wonder, I mean, I know a lot of people
are getting very cynical and very
skeptical about the Trump administration
and saying that Trump has wimped it.
David Grush um uh you know obviously
stuck his neck out recently on Fox News
by doing another interview with Brett
Bayer in the hope that we could push the
Trump administration to do something
about the UAP disclosure issue. Other
people have spoken more recently. The
age of disclosure is an enormous leap
forward in terms of adding credibility
to the issue. I'm very disappointed. I
don't see any evidence at all that the
Trump administration at executive level
in the White House is doing anything
about it. There is there is an ongoing
FBI and office of director of national
intelligence Tulsi Gabbard Cash Patel
investigation into alleged illegalities.
Uh no answers yet on what's coming out
of that but uh there is a deafening
silence from the White House. Is it as
I've been told that the president is too
scared to take this issue on? Has Donald
Trump wimped it? I'm not calling the
president a coward, but is he
intimidated by the national security
state? Has he been cowed by the deep
state? I wonder.
>> Well, our next question is in that
similar vein. This is from Marty and
email. Hi, Megan Ross. Appreciate your
efforts on this subject. As someone who
has been following this fascinating
mystery for over 30 plus, I'm starting
to feel we are on the brink of an
announcement, especially after hearing
the comment in the last week from
various individuals, David Grash, etc.
that efforts are ongoing in the Trump
White House. Ross, did you notice within
the end credits of Age of Disclosure,
Bob Fish was an adviser. Is that
significant? Also, when General Neil
McCassland mentioned in a leaked email
it was the end of the Cold War and we
discovered a life form, he might have
been referring to the NHI's taken back
to the US after the Virginhai UFO crash
in 1996.
That was not long after the Cold War had
ended. Thanks and keep up the good work.
>> Okay, now I might be wrong on this, but
I'm pretty sure cuz I wrote the book
about this. I'm pretty sure he didn't
say it was the end of the Cold War and
we found a life form. I think he said to
Tom Dong, and this is the quote, it was
the cold war and we found a life form.
Um, and that doesn't mean it was at the
end of the cold war. I don't think it
was the 1996 vaginha crash that he's
referring to. Um, I think General Neil
Mccasand when he was talking to Tom Dong
was probably talking about either
Roswell 1947 or Aztec which I think was
194849
I can't remember straight away but um
there were as we know alleged multiple
retrievals of craft in that period of
time in the late 40s early 50s. Um as
for Bob Fish Bob's a friend of mine we
keep in touch. Um, I don't think it's
significant that Bob was an adviser to
the age of disclosure. Uh, if I was um
Dan Farah and uh J Stratton and uh uh Lu
Lzando who were putting all this film
together, I would be basically um
wanting to draw on the best available
sources. And Bob's one of the people who
I highlighted in my book knew a great
deal. He was um revealed in the Podesta
emails that were leaked on Wikileaks. uh
to be someone who'd contacted uh Podesta
in the White House with information
about UAPs. Um but I I you know with the
greatest respect to Bob, I don't think
his information is any more revelatory
than what people like David Grush or J
Stratton or others have revealed. Um,
suffice to say, I just want to
emphasize, I think at the moment, what
the Trump administration is doing on
UAPs is a big fat nothing. And I worry
that we are having the wool pulled over
our eyes yet again by the national
security state that has been fighting a
viciferous war behind the scenes. A
lobbying battle with key senators, key
chairmen and women of various committees
to try and shut down public scrutiny of
the UAP issue. There are very brave and
courageous politicians who've stuck
their necks out and whistleblowers like
Dave Grush, Jay Stratton, Lu Lzando
who've really pushed hard for the White
House to do something about it. But I
have to say at the moment I think that
we are essentially being blown smoke and
mirrors. I I think the administration is
trying to ignore it. I don't know
whether it's just because it's
distracted by other events. I find it
very hard to believe that either Marco
Rubio or Donald Trump would not have
asked the question as soon as they got
into power. Frankly, they should have.
This is all about the concealment of
technologies,
of information,
of incredible knowledge, sacred
knowledge that the public, the human
race has a right to know. Unless there's
some good reason for the public not to
be told about it, I think the president
should be considering making an
announcement. And uh it would be a grave
disappointment if we came to the end of
2025, yet another year where a president
allows themselves to be snowed by the
national security state.
>> Okay, Ross, I've got another big
headline that we would like your input
on. The AP put this out. Malaysia's
transport ministry said Wednesday that a
private firm will resume a deep sea hunt
for Malaysia's airline Flight 370 later
this month, more than a decade after the
jet vanished without a trace. The search
will be carried out by a Texas-based
marine robotics firm, Ocean Infiniti,
which signed a no find, no fee contract
with Malaysia's government in March.
>> Well, it's good news. It's good news
that they're recommencing a search. My
worry is that they may [clears throat]
be looking in the wrong place. A lot of
this is based on I won't go into the
incredible detail of it, but essentially
it's um new types of data uh
investigating um uh electromagnetic
uh
radiation changes that occur when an
aircraft moves through space. U and it
means that they allegedly have been able
to plot or or harden up the location of
MH370 somewhere at the bottom allegedly
of the Indian Ocean. Um, I'll be
interested to see what they find and if
they find. I've done numerous stories on
MH370.
As viewers would know, I do not
subscribe to one conspiracy theory that
MH370 was um taken by orbs into some
kind of portal which uh is based on a
now discredited CGI. And at risk of
attracting the viciferousness of several
raving nutters on UAP media, I just
don't give that theory any currency at
all. But I do think that there's
something anomalous about the
disappearance of MH370.
It needs to be resolved. It's one of the
biggest aviation mysteries of all time.
And um I'm actually in touch with people
in Malaysia at the moment. I may be
bringing a future story to reality check
with some new information from Malaysian
researchers, which interestingly enough
suggests that MH370 may be in an
entirely different location from where
the Ocean Infinity people will be
searching. So, it'll be very interesting
to see what comes out of this search.
It's good news, though. Um, I just I
hope like hell for the families. I'm in
touch with two of the families. Uh
people forget that, you know, there are
loved ones who've been agonizing for 10
years now to get an answer about this
and it causes them real pain when there
is um a lot of wacky conspiracy theories
pedled about coverups and lies. So the
public do deserve answers, especially
the the people the families of those who
were lost.
>> Absolutely. Russ, we will go to our next
question posted on X. This is from Guy
Incognito. Who is the person you trust
the most in the government when it comes
to being open and honest about the
phenomenon and why?
>> Um, I can't name that person. In fact,
there's multiple people in government
who are helping me on a confidential
basis. Uh, I trust them the most because
they have been consistently accurate in
terms of what they've told me about the
legacy UAP retrieval and reverse
engineering program. They are patriots.
They think that there are crimes being
committed, illegalities being
perpetrated because of the continued
concealment of this program. They think
that there are sections of the Pentagon
and the intelligence community and
private aerospace who have exceeded
lawful authority and are basically
acting uh ultravar above the law and
they think it's time that they were
brought into check. Um uh I can't name
those people because to do so would be
to jeopardize their confidentiality. But
uh suffice to say there are real
patriots in the American government,
good people who recognize the public's
right to know um uh in government. I
guess if you would if you were to
nominate people in government, does it
constitute being in government to be
working as a staffer for a um a member
of Congress? If that was the case, I'd
nominate Dave Grush because David Grush
has consistently been, in my opinion,
the most accurate and the most truthful
reteller of what he knows. And um I just
hope that at some stage he gets the
vindication he deserves.
>> The first ever reality check disclosure
award goes to Dave Grush. [laughter]
>> All right, here's an email from Joe.
Goodday, Ross. If Brandon has direwolf
DNA, wouldn't it be the ultimate
evidence, not to mention a suite up
yours if he invested in producing a
clone? Love your work. Thanks, mate.
Joe.
>> Okay, just to give our audience some
background to this, a few months ago, I
did a reality check with Brendan Fugal
where we went through some of the
revelations from the latest Skinwalker
Ranch series. And unlike a lot of
people, I actually applaud the science
that's being done by the scientists on
Skinwalker Ranch. Um, I don't think it's
a government disinformation project and
I think they are doing good, solid work.
And I'm persuaded that Brandon is
genuine when he says that he will not
allow the people that are doing the
production to put in knowingly false
information. Um, I'd love to hear from
anyone, by the way, who you a lot of
people claim to me that there's stuff on
skinwalker that's false. I'd love to
hear your evidence. Um, the interview I
did with Brandon, we talked about the
fact that a partial dire wolf, potential
dire wolf carcass was found by a
riverbank on Skinw Walker Ranch. Why is
this significant? Well, firstly, it's
significant because there are allegedly
no wolves in Utah. Uh, more importantly,
the dire wolf died out 10,000 years ago.
It's not meant to exist currently. Um,
the bits that were found from memory, I
do recall it was a jawbone and some
other DNA material. It was DNA tested by
a company known as Colossal Bioscience.
Um, and yes, they are the people who are
going on to try to clone a new direwolf,
a modern-day direwolf. uh they made a
claim I think back in April this year
that they had successfully cloned or
were about to successfully clone but
there's some skepticism about that. What
can we say? I don't think we can
definitively say that what was recovered
at Skinwalker Ranch was a dire wolf. But
what they did find was that it was 30
No, it was less than that. It was about,
shout at me if I'm wrong, Brandon, but I
think it was 10% or 30% DNA of a wolf
and the remainder was some species
unknown to human science, which strongly
suggests it might be dire wolf. And I
also remember there was a biologist
zoologologist called um I can't remember
his first name Woodruff on the
Skinwalker Ranch episode who looked at
the uh structure of the jawbone of the
creature that was found and said it
looked like a spitting image of a
direwolf. So how did this happen? We
don't know. Uh but wouldn't it be cool
if they could uh create a direwolf from
that DNA? Um let's wait and see. I'd
like to see the evidence. Um, certainly
one cannot say categorically that it was
a direwolf that was recovered, but sure
as hell it's intriguing. If it wasn't,
what is it?
All right, we have another question
about Skinwalker Ranch. This is an email
from John. Hi Ross. Wouldn't Robert
Bigalow be a great person for Congress
to have to testify for a future UAP
hearing? If I'm not mistaken, Mr.
Piccolo has been involved in many
aspects of this field and his several
year ownership in research at Skinwalker
Ranch, the results of which have never
been released to the public could
provide a lot of information. Thanks and
keep up the good work.
Uh firstly I I would actually want to
underline I think the public owes a deep
debt of gratitude to Robert Bigalow for
funding the research that was done by
his firstly um NID's team the National
Institute of Discovery Science of which
Edgar Mitchell was a member a board
member they did some of the original
groundbreaking work into Skinwalker
Ranch and my understanding is he was
also then involved when the DIA came
into the ranch and um did some of their
investigations there and uh indeed he
may have been present when some of the
anomalous phenomena was observed. Um it
would be fantastic to get Robert Bigalow
to give evidence but I suspect he's
operating under the same constraints as
a lot of people from that event are.
They're under non-disclosure agreements
with the Defense Intelligence Agency
which funded the OSAP research. That
wouldn't block Robert Legalow, by the
way, from uh doing um an interview about
his National Institute of Discovery
Science research. And look, he's done a
couple of interviews over the years with
George Knapp, our friend and colleague.
U and I'd love to get him on reality
check. I've tried a few times. Um he uh
he's resistant to um intense
journalistic scrutiny I suspect because
there are a lot of questions curly
questions we could ask him about what
he's uncovered in his time there and
what conclusions he's reached. And don't
forget also that Robert Bigalow has also
been doing work into consciousness. Um
tragically I understand he lost his son.
Uh my deepest sympathies there sir. And
more importantly, he's taken an enormous
amount of effort to fund investigative
research into whether human
consciousness survives biological death.
And I strongly suspect it does. So yes,
he'd be a great interview uh along with
so many other people who should be
called. I'm constantly perplexed at the
people who are being called before the
congressional inquiries. And I don't
know why people like Robert Bigalow are
not being called in open public forum
and invited to give testimony under oath
in a full public hearing. It would be
great to hear him testify. He's a great
American. He's given an enormous amount,
much much more than people realize to
public understanding of anomalous
phenomena and uh he deserves credit for
that.
>> I agree, Ross. You know, I'm from Las
Vegas. So um the Big Lows are an amazing
family in
>> Oh, you're a Las Vegas girl. I thought
you were a California girl. I'm I'm
everywhere, Ross. I'm I'm everywhere.
[laughter]
But Vegas, yep, Vegas made, baby. Go
night.
>> Okay, I just want to give a quick plug
to the state of the world forum which is
being held online hosted by my friend
Jim Garrison and myself on the period
14th to the 17th of December this year.
Uh what is the state of the world forum?
Well, Jim Garrison is an amazing guy. He
uh worked for a long time with the New
Paradigm Institute with Danny Sheen and
he's moved very much more assertively
into consciousness studies. Uh Jim
wouldn't mind me saying he's a bit of an
old hippie and at the end of the cold
war he did something quite miraculous
between 1995 and 2000 he started up this
thing called the state of the world
forum where he got Mikall Gorbachef the
president of Russia and u secretary of
state James Baker um the Indian national
congress president Sonia Gandhi the
primatologist Jane Goodall noble
laureates South African president they
becki and an array of people to come and
speak at a forum that discussed the
state of the world at the end of the
cold war and what possibilities there
might be for peace in the world in the
emerging world order and 20 years on
Jim's decided to do it again and I'm
very privileged to be involved in this
on December the 14th and just to repeat
the link it's www.stateoftheorld.forum
forum on the 14th to the 17th of
December and it's centering around four
consequential truths. Accelerating
planetary ecological collapse,
increasing global and social
instability. Are we going to war? Is
World War II imminent? Exponential AI.
Are the computers going to kill us? And
my personal favorite and obsession,
cosmic intelligences are present on
Earth.
It's the first time that disclosure is
going to be integrated into a major
conference with other world issues and
we'll be running multiple forums
highlighting the latest for example
three atlas with professor Avi lobe UFOs
and nukes with Dr. Beatric Villerol, my
favorite astrophysicist,
and the interface between AI and
non-human intelligence with Pipper
Mongrren and numerous other speakers
speaking about consciousness and how we
can achieve world peace. It may be a
naive hope in these grim times as the
clock ticks ever closer to doomsday
midnight, but he is hoping that the
speakers including Diane Hennessy
Powell, Dr. Ravi lobe Kai Dickens from
telep telepathy tapes astrophysicist Dr.
Beatatric Villerol Dr. Rupert Shel
Sheldrake the biologist and
consciousness researcher former US
National Science Foundation program
director Dr. Anna Brady Estz experiencer
author Chris Bledzo economist
technologist Dr. Pipper Mongram and
former UAP task force collaborator Sarah
Gam. He is hoping we can arrive at a
solution for world peace and UFOs AI
NHI. Please go to

that'll be taking place from December
the 14th for 3 days. I hope to see you
there. Thank you so much for joining us
here on our first reality check Q&A.
Since I've come back from South America,
News Nation cruy rejected my bid to
become the Rapanui correspondent. I had
dreams of panina coladas and sacheting
beach holiday for the rest of my life.
It wasn't going to happen. But it's an
amazing story and we're looking forward
