What has happened at Pine Gap is it's
become an absolutely essential arm of
the Five Eyes Alliance. Um, I've seen uh
serendipitously uh I was taken through a
place called Garden Island in central
Sydney and I was uh at one stage
escorted by a very senior minister in
our government and taken somewhere where
I probably shouldn't and shown the feeds
coming into a naval facility in central
Sydney which are also the feeds I
understand that go through Pine Gap and
they were literally satellite feeds from
drones and from satellites in real time
coming in through Australia on their way
to America and they were mindblowing. Uh
it was quite extraordinary to see the
level to which Australia as an ally of
the United States is plugged in to the
intelligence feed from America. Okay.
