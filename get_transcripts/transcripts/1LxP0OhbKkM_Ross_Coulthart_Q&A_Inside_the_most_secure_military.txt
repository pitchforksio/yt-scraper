Well, good day and welcome back to
Reality Check Q&A, where you get to ask
me the hard questions. And here to grill
me today, of course, is Megan Order, my
friend and colleague. Hello, Megan. How
are you?
>> Just spectacular, Ross. How are you
today?
>> Well, we're in the middle of a drone
flap right now. So interesting things
going on, not just in Scandinavia
anymore, but across Western Europe.
Sightings all over the place. French
police boarding a u a Russian flagged
vessel which allegedly was involved in
the drones debacle. Of course, no
evidence yet. I'd like to see some hard
evidence that these drones are in fact
uh drones at all. We're still keeping an
open mind on whatever it was that was
hovering over Norway and Denmark.
Interesting day as well. Interesting to
see that the latest polling shows that
confidence in the media has fallen
plummeted to 28%
across all respondents. And if you're a
Republican, confidence in the news media
is at 8%. Now, we like to think here at
Reality Check on NewsNation that that's
because they're not covering the UAP
issue. And just following up on that,
you might remember a few weeks ago we
had uh Kase Best, a um former US Air
Force intelligence officer, telling us
about weird sightings he made near the
Shyen Mountain underground nuclear
defense complex in Colorado. Well, our
friend and colleague Brian Enton had a
wonderful opportunity recently to go to
the Shyen Mountain Complex, and he was
able to ask a general and a historian,
no less, are there any weird sightings
they've seen? And this was their answer.
>> Are there things that your sensors pick
up that you can't explain?
>> I thought you were going to ask me about
tracking Santa instead of UFOs, but uh
too. Yeah, we do that too. Um,
>> well, we try to detect everything and
then usually uh you know, we we filter
out what is uh is not a threat and then
we can capture and catalog everything
and if and if if there's something
unusual, you know, there's offices that
we can, you know, share that data with.
But I I have never seen anything that
that can't be explained.
>> Where did all the alien rumors come
from?
Probably Stargate might have a might
have a a little bit to go with that. I
think Star I think the the show Star the
movie Stargate had them go through the
Stargate in Gen.
>> And can you officially say no aliens?
>> I can officially say there's no nothing
in the historical record about aliens
being in here.
>> So as you'll see Megan, that was a
pretty naff response from both the
general and the historian. They're
obviously covering up.
Well, it was interesting to see, Ross,
and we have some video of this. They did
have little aliens um all around the
base and inside the mountain. So, it's
clear that they're aware of the rumors.
Um and it's also funny how the general
equates um asking about UFOs to asking
about Santa Claus.
>> It's kind of the default, isn't it? It's
kind of sad. There'll have to come a
moment one day when there's not the
default to ridicule and stigma and taboo
attached to the UAP subject. It does
deserve to be taken seriously because we
do know that Northcom NORAD has been
involved in sightings that cannot be
explained. I've told the story before
about objects that were detected near
the Arctic Circle. Uh jets were diverted
to go and have a look to see what they
were, but they moved incredibly fast and
got away before the jets could
intercept. And there are repeated
sightings that we know haven't been
being reported by Northcom NORAD until
very recently. And that was one of the
things that I understand the proposed
UAP Disclosure Act legislation was going
to try to remedy. Unfortunately, for the
third year running, the UAP disclosure
laws have been subverted from within
Congress. Unfortunately, it's looking
very, very likely that the proposed
amendments to the UAP Disclosure Act,
which come inside the Defense
Appropriations, are not going to pass
this year. And it would appear that
Republican Congress representatives have
been got at. It's a shameful episode,
and it shows who's really pulling the
strings in Congress. Are we ever going
to see UAP disclosure from within
government? I increasingly doubt it
unless President Trump shows real
leadership and steps up to the plate.
>> All right, Ross, we will go to our first
question and actually an interesting
theory from Evan. He says, "Thank you,
Ross and Megan, for all your hard work.
Watch you guys all the time." By the
way, Ross, your accent is so freaking
awesome. I hope one day I can shake your
hand, sir. Would be an honor. My
question whenever you have the time to
answer it is, what do you think about
the possibility that these drones could
actually be looking for their stolen
tech that we all know someone has? I
know they are all around the world, but
it's interesting that they are spotted
in localized areas like New Jersey. It's
not like we see them out over here in
Lexington, North Carolina. I mean, if we
have recovered tech from crash UFOs,
it's a safe bet that these aliens have
the ability to track their own tech,
just like our own military, where we are
not supposed to leave our military
high-tech equipment behind for
adversaries to possibly use or reverse
engineer. I'm surprised no one has
thought of this as a possibility. I'm
convinced that these drones are alien,
and if they were Russian or something
else, then I would expect our government
would have shot them down by now. Just
curious about your thoughts. Sincerely,
Evan.
Well, that's a really good question. U I
I have to say if they are looking for
their own tech, then there's a hell of a
lot of tech that they've had taken off
them that's hanging around the continent
of the United States. And just to
respond to your uh point about North
Carolina, there have been sightings in
and around North Carolina, repeated
sightings. I've spoken to people who've
been seeing these purported drones, but
even more interestingly, large black
triangle objects. Um, the uh gentleman
we interviewed a few weeks ago, Magic
Mike Batista, he lives very near Fort
Bragg in South Carolina. and uh he told
me about an incident that uh was
attended by among other people Fred
Baker, the u uh special forces soldier
now retired, who was with him when they
summoned allegedly a gigantic multiple
football fieldsiz triangular craft. And
that's a uh a sighting in South Carolina
that was witnessed by Fred to
corroborate what Magic Mike says he was
able to see. It's interesting because I
actually favor the explanation more
likely that what we're talking about
here is if it is non-human intelligence,
and I suspect some of it is, I suspect
they're taking an interest in weapons,
defense facilities, nuclear armed,
nuclearpowered facilities. and I hope
they're friendly. There's a great quote
from a uh an Australian journalist who
was investigating UAPs in New Zealand,
Quinton Fogerty, and he said, "Let's
hope they're friendly because whatever
they are, they're demonstrating um what
you might call ISR, intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance. Every
single nuclear site in the United States
has probably been visited by NHI, UAPs."
Robert Hastings wonderful book, UFOs and
Nukes, tells the story really well.
Robert set out to investigate sightings
that he heard about when he was sweeping
the floors at a US Air Force base and he
discovered over many decades that there
were people who'd seen objects over
nuclear weapons facilities, nuclear uh
power facilities in pretty much every
such facility in the United States. And
this is the same all around the world.
So, I favor the idea that whatever they
are, they're taking an interest in in
nuclear weapons because perhaps they're
concerned about our use of nuclear
weapons. Or worse still, perhaps they're
wrecking to find out where our most
powerful weapons are. I just don't know
the answer. But it's completely within
the realms of plausibility in my book
that if you're a non-human intelligence
coming back to this planet, you're
interested to know where your technology
is being stored by the United States.
And certainly there are a lot of
sightings over Tonipar, Area 51,
uh China Lake, all of those big national
security ranges that none of us are
allowed into. And I'd love to have a
look inside the dark caves and crevices
inside those facilities because I'm told
there are some very interesting things
locked away. I'd also be taking a very
close interest in Sedona, uh, which is
the place where we've told the story
previously of an alleged deep
underground military base.
>> All right, we will go to an email. This
is coming in from Renee. Dear Megan
Ross,
>> forgive me for interrupting, Megan. I
should say
>> I should say Melinda Leslie recently
told me she's the Sedona based UAP tour
guide uh who takes people out on night
vision goggle tour guides and Belinda
let me know just this week that the
frequency of UAPs being observed over
Secret Mountain at Sedona being escorted
by military helicopters it's completely
off the charts. She's saying she's never
seen such an intensity before. So
whatever these objects are, it's
happening much much more frequently.
>> All right. Well, this email that I'm
just about to read, this is some objects
being seen as well. So, dear Megan and
Ross, I live in the city named Ron
located at Borholm Island. We are part
of Denmark, although although we are
located south of Sweden. Three days ago,
I had two observations timing around 10
p.m. local time. One, I saw my I saw
from my yard a white sphere moving fast.
The best description I can think of is
like a billiard ball in the size and
color. Clearly much larger than the
planets and much smaller than the moon.
Color was white. It seemed to have its
own color, but nothing was raying. It
moved very fast. I saw it for less than
a second. I saw it from 90° to 120
degrees at the horizon. Then it
disappeared behind house roofs. um
height over ground no more than 100
meters moving in parallel with the earth
not falling I guess the distance between
500 to a thousand meters two later less
than an hour I observed from my first
floor window an object of the same size
as the stars it was blinking as stars do
but it was blinking red white green and
the object was steady not moving the
direction was toward the airport of
Borholm distance from my window 5
kilometers I think it might have been a
drone drones were observed over the
airport by other people that evening. I
follow your channel and never miss
anything from you guys. I saw what I saw
what I saw, but I have never heard of
anything in that size and color. The
nearest I can think of is the egg with
Jake Barber, but the size was too small
for that. So my question, have you any
knowledge about an object like this and
the coincidence with the drone
observations? Has anybody else had such
an observation?
>> Okay, it's really interesting, isn't it?
This is such clever psychological
operations. So the government started
using the language of drones. They
started immediately suggesting that
these objects were Russian. And they may
well be. But the simple fact is what
people are telling me they're seeing,
what has actually been videoed and
photographed are often not what look
like drones. And neither are they small
light aircraft as certain seagull
obsessed people are are suggesting.
What these people are telling me they've
seen and I've had hundreds of messages
from people with videos and photographs
is exactly what this correspondent
suggests. Orbs, spherical orblike
objects. And th this is very very
common. And I've had messages from
Norway, Denmark, Sweden, France, uh
Germany. People are telling me they're
seeing these weird spherical objects
often reasonably close, like within 150
ft.
There's no discernable noise. There's no
propeller. There's no jet. There's no
engine noise at all. These objects are
moving soundlessly.
when they do move, they kind of have a
glow from within. Um, and then sometimes
some people swear to me, and I' I've
I've seen video showing this, but it's
very very blurry, and quite frankly, it
doesn't really prove much at all. You
you you see an orb object, and then you
see it kind of change, and you see the
shape in some cases of a quadcopter or
what looks like an aircraft. And it
can't plausibly be an aircraft because
it's moving at maybe 10 kilometers an
hour, 10 miles an hour, just moving very
very slowly, impossibly slowly for a um
a jet aircraft. And nobody can explain
what this is. And the interesting thing
is the language that's been used of to
describe the objects that were over the
airport is drones. And this
correspondent immediately delineates
between what they're seeing and the
reported drones over the airport. And
frankly, I'm not buying that they're
different. I still think we need to
consider the possibility that they're
all one and the same objects, but that
they're capable of changing form. At the
moment, uh we're talking I think it's uh
early October.
There is no evidence at this stage even
though there's been a police raid on a
um a ship called the Borke or Bourke.
I've forgotten what it is, but it's a a
tanker that was boarded by French naval
forces with great publicity and
apparently the captain and the first
mate were arrested. There's no evidence
anywhere on that ship of drone
technology. Now admittedly, if it was
the dastardly Ruskies, they would have
thrown it overboard, I'm sure. But it's
just doesn't make any sense to me that
for over a week, we've had dozens and
dozens and dozens of sightings over
civilian and military airspace right
across the sway of Western Europe. And
not one of those objects has been able
to be tracked. Some of them have been
enormous. Some people have said that
they're the size of a large passenger
aircraft. Um, a lot of people have
described them as being roughly 5x 5 m
square. That's a significant object. It
would show up on radar even if it's made
of carbon fiber or plastic. Why are we
not able to track these objects and
follow them to source? And when they're
hovering over empty areas, as we know
they have been, why are they not able to
be brought down with high pulse
microwave or other counter UAS
technology? I'm not saying it's not the
Ruskies. I'm just saying show me the
evidence. And isn't it clever the way
that the word drones is used to
immediately plant in the mind of the
public the most plausible Okam's razor
explanation that this is just the
Russians. And I think there's a risk
behind that. The risk is escalation. The
risk is that the Russians get upset that
they're being accused incorrectly
perhaps of deploying these drones. And
frankly, we should ask, we should test
these claims that are being made. There
is no evidence at this stage that it's
the Russians. Um I do recall uh a drone
flap, I think it was back 2022, 2023
over Sweden and there was an arrest made
of a young Russian man and a lot was
made in the national media at the time
that he was linked to Putin through his
father because his father ran the
railways in Russia and he was arrested
and accused of spying using a drone. And
it turned out he was acquitted. Not
really widely reported. He was acquitted
because it wasn't able to be proven that
he knew that what he was doing was
illegal. He had a yacht. He put his
drone up over his yacht and he was
arrested for using his drone.
So, a lot of the evidence that's being
used to point at the Russians, yes, I
know the Russians are quite capable of
being duplicitous and dastardly and evil
and they will do terrible things if they
can get away with it. But in this case,
I just want to see evidence. Show me the
evidence and why can't we track or bring
down these objects? It doesn't make any
sense to me.
>> Okay, Russ, we were going to stick with
um questions about the egg. Deadrock um
reached out to me on X saying, "Ross,
can you provide any follow up on the egg
retrieval footage shown during your Jake
Barber interview?" I responded asking
what specifically would you like
information on? And he's saying, "We
know nothing." So any all info on date,
time, location, circumstances leading to
the landing, crash, retrieval carried
out by who, details of the egg itself,
who took it away, where was it taken,
etc.
>> Okay, think about what you're asking. If
I gave you the date, if I gave you the
location and the full details, then what
would happen? The people who provided me
that video might be implicated. So, one
of the things we have to do as
journalists is protect sources. And uh
yes, I'm absolutely convinced that the
egg video is authentic. It's genuine.
And it's very typical of the kind of
objects that Jake Barber has been on his
own admission involved in retrieving in
the location he euphemistically calls
the range. I can't tell you any more
than that because one of the obligations
we have as journalists is to protect our
sources. It took a hell of a lot to get
that video. It didn't come from Jake
Barber. It came from other sources. And
I know it's authentic and I'm afraid
you're just going to have to accept it.
What I find is very, very conspicuous is
the complete lack of comment from the
Defense Department or the intelligence
community or the government. They've
said nothing. And the reason why is
because they know it's genuine. And they
also know that we know a great deal
about the range, where it is, and who's
involved. And what really I think
frustrates me is Congress could do this.
Congress knows all this because they've
been told about all of this in secure
skiff hearings by Jake Barber. They've
got this information. So, why the hell
are we, how does one say this politely,
pussyfooting around by um not calling
people who should be called or allowing
people who are evading being called to
evade being called, we should just
subpoena these organizations. And that's
why it's a very good development that
Anna Paulina Luna, the chairwoman of the
oversight committee task force that's
investigating
um uh this issue. She's basically said
that they're going to start subpoenaing
witnesses possibly involuntarily and
they've sent out interrogatories
questions and one of the things they
should be asking about is questions
about these particular facilities where
Jake Barber has given firsthand evidence
of his direct knowledge of being
involved in retrievals. So I'm sorry I
can't give you dates. I can't give you
names. I can't tell you who's involved
because to do so is to compromise
sources. Um, I think it's an
extraordinary act of courage by Jake
Barber to have come out and said what he
said and done what he's done. And
frankly, the most conspicuous thing that
I can see is the failure by Congress to
pick up on those allegations and
actually do the job. I mean, we've just
had this depressing situation this week
where we've learned that for the third
year running, the UAP disclosure laws
are going to be gagged in the Congress.
It's not going to happen. We're not
going to get new laws that protect
whistleblowers coming through in the
defense appropriations legislation. And
that's a disgrace because the Republican
uh congressional representatives could
have voted for this and some of them
didn't. And they need to be held their
feet their feet need to be held to the
fire and asked why. And the reason why
is because they're little licks lap dog
puppies to the national security state.
Who's running America? Congress or the
national security state?
>> I know.
>> Um I will go to a question from
Shardwell also from X Ross. When Dylan
Borland says he knows about quote the
most important technology in this world
and it's not the craft itself. Is he
talking about scalar weapons?
>> He could be. I don't know. I haven't I
haven't spoken to Dylan. I'd love to
speak to him. Dylan, if you want to talk
to Reality Check, we'd love to have you
on. It's uh fantastic to see Dylan
giving evidence to the Congress at the
recent congressional hearing and it
would be wonderful to get him and Jeff
Masatelli onto the show to hear their
full stories. Um I I'm not sure. I think
he might have been referring more likely
to the energy systems which lie
potentially behind this retrieved
technology. If it is true, and I suspect
it is, that the United States has been
able to develop a knowledge or an
understanding of 0 point energy
extraction. Um, that's energy from the
quantum vacuum, which would be literally
an unlimited source of energy. Um, maybe
what he's referring to is the fact that
the United States is sitting on a
solution to the fossil fuel greenhouse
gas crisis and um he thinks it's as
outrageous as the rest of us do. If it's
true that this energy technology is
being suppressed, then that would
explain a great deal, but it could very
well be scalar weapons.
>> Okay, we have a question from Shaker
Head. Um, we have talked about Matthew
Brown's immaculate constellation before
and I did send this viewer a link to
that and we've briefly done it on the
Q&A, but he wants to know why hasn't
Matthew Brown's immaculate constellation
report on UAPs been discussed on reality
check? His insights were highlighted by
Rep. Nancy Mason deemed credible by
others. Is there a specific reason for
this omission?
>> Oh, interesting question. Um, look, to
be honest with you, um, I I've felt that
Matthew's been on so many shows. We try
and bring you programs that break news.
And, um, my friends and colleagues,
George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell over at
Weaponized, who've done a superb job
bringing Matthew's story uh, to public
attention. Um, uh, I'd love to have
Matthew on with Reality Check at some
stage. And I've really enjoyed and I
recommend to people that they read his
more expansive Substack essays that he's
been writing in recent times. Um, you
can go to Matthew Brown's Twitter and
you can find your way to his Substack
through there. Um, uh, I I would like to
see a more detailed government response
on Matthew Brown's comments about
Immaculate Constellation. Um, basically,
uh, you know, he's made these assertions
and the most conspicuous thing is the
complete absence of comment from
government as to the veracity of his
claims. Let's hear from government. Um,
I'm very careful on reality check to
make sure that we're not recycling
stories, just telling the same old
stories. We try and break news on
reality check. And I really admire and
respect Matthew and any other witness
who's had the courage to come forward.
I'd love to get him on reality check.
The simple fact is there's one of me and
there's only so many weeks in the year
and uh Megan and I are doing our darnest
to get on top of the number of people
who are already responding to us and
sending us information for potential
interviews. Um maybe we should. I'm very
happy to consider it.
>> Okay, we have a question coming in from
Anthony. Hello Megan and Ross. Hope
you're well. Ross, I have a question for
you that's a bit out there, but in your
years of researching UAP, have you ever
come across any link with wolfman,
werewolf, werewolf type entities
traveling in red orbshaped craft,
perhaps like those investigated by BASS?
I asked because in this channeling
session from 1976
when referencing a case in the book
silent invasion by Stan Gordon, it is
claimed that the craft encountered quote
was a thought form created by entities
of the astral plane. It had substance in
being in our world for a short time. It
conveyed the bodies of creatures which
are likened to what you call the
werewolf. These creatures emerged upon
the physical world. End quote.
I have heard accounts, witness accounts
of werewolf like creatures from the
skinwalker ranch. Of course, uh but I
don't think I've heard instances of
werewolf wolflike creatures flying in
orbs. I think there's two separate
things. There are accounts that I do
know of from the BASS investigations
which were the Defense Intelligence
Agency sponsored investigations at the
Skin Walker Ranch in the Uinta Basin in
Utah. And one of my favorite stories is
uh the Sherman family shooting with a
3030 rifle, which is quite a heavy
caliber rifle, at a gigantic wolf,
massive wolf that was allegedly six or
seven feet long in its body, just
sitting staring at them. And um Terry
Sherman apparently went inside. He
initially fired a pistol at it. Then he
went inside and grabbed his 3030 rifle
and fired several rounds at it. and he
and his wife Gwen basically said that it
made no discernable effect on the
creature and it just loped away. No
blood trail, nothing. It didn't seem to
be injured. Um, and there's been in the
skinwalker ranch a succession of such
sightings and weird experiences. The
whole skinwalker story involves
creatures that appear to turn into
wolves. Um, it's central to the George
Neap and Com Keller book, Hunt for the
Skinw Walker, uh, which I really
recommend. It's a great read. And it,
that book talks about a former DIA
official, James Lett's interest in the
ranch. And, um, Latky got involved, uh,
through the ORAP funding, um, with Bass
investigators
looking at similar crypted encounters.
And in those encounters, the Shermans
who were the previous owners of the
ranch before uh Robert Bigalow and then
more recently Brandon Fugal, they
reported these wolfmanlike figures and
they've been seen by the Ut Indians for
many many hundreds of years.
And it looks like a werewolf on steroids
allegedly. And and it's part of the
skinwalker legend. this massive howling
OB beast stalking livestock. Um
I I I wish I could see some of this. Um
uh it's been widely reported in the
Skinwalker Ranch. Um there have also
been orbs, red orbs reported by the
Shermans and I think also cited by the
um Nids and Bass team. Often they're
just one or three feet in diameter. They
maneuver silently. They they show heat
and apparently they've even caused burns
and electromagnetic interference.
There's one account that involves an
orb, a red orb hovering over cattle. And
there were mutilations that that
happened subsequently. It's not sure
whether they were connected, but they
were these surgically precise animal
mutilations, precise excisions without
blood. Um there's also um another orb,
I'm not sure if this one was red, that
was chased by dogs and they disappeared
into the bush barking after this orb and
they were never seen again. And the
interesting thing is these are
government scientists in some cases that
are actually reporting these sightings.
Um there's been huge craft reported over
the Uint basin, not all of them read.
Um,
uh, I'm just trying to remember what it
was. Um, in the I think it was the bass
analysis,
they suggested that there was something
interconnected. They James Latki's team
viewed the cryptids as perhaps some kind
of interdimensional manifestation
uh, tied to these probes. Um, their
report, which has been partially
released via FOI, includes ranch data on
biological effects from orbs involving
non-human entities. And I vaguely recall
there was a BAS employee who used the
pseudonym chip. And he confirmed in
interviews that there were links between
werewolves and orbs that were probed as
evidence of interdimensional incursions.
So yeah, I mean Skinwalker Ranch is a
hot bed for this, but I can tell you
I've also in my investigations here in
Australia, uh I've spoken to people uh
in the little town of Xmouth, far up on
the northwest coast of Australia near
the very mysterious what was once a US
base called the Harold Eye Halt Naval
Communications Station. And uh as well
as one woman telling me that she saw a
werewolf stealing her mangoes off her
mango tree, multiple people have told
me, including um council workers, people
who were working on the road in the
area, that they've seen loping hairy
wolflike creatures in the area. And
there have been red orbs reported over
that area as well. And I don't think
it's a coincidence that these are two
hotspots of paranormal activity. Maybe
there is some kind of portal at both of
these locations. There's a lot of
speculation of portals. Portals in
places like Sedona, places like
Northwest Cape in Australia and Utah,
the Uent Basin. So yeah, there are
definitely red orbs. There are
definitely allegations of werewolves,
wolflike creatures. I haven't heard any
specific mention of wolflike creatures
on craft, but I wouldn't be surprised.
All right, Russ, we have one more
question for today's Q&A. We need your
insight on the horrible breaking news
out of Australia of Nicole Kidman and
Keith Urban breaking up.
>> Look, it's very sad. We we were
devastated to hear this. Keith and uh
Nicole actually own a house about a
kilometer from where I'm sitting and
it's in the Southern Highlands uh just
south of Sydney, a beautiful big
rambling country house. A lot of us in
the area who know that they live there
and visit occasionally, we respect their
privacy and they've put these gigantic
earth berms around the property so that
um snappers photographers can't sneak
illicit shots of them. And frankly, I
feel so sorry for them. I think the
pressures of public life are such that
the intrusions on their privacy and
their time are such that it must weigh
on them and the kids. Um, uh, my wife
and, uh, daughter recently went to Keith
Urban's concert in Sydney, and they're
now realizing they'd missed out on
Breaking the Big Scoop. Because at the
very end of the concert, which was about
a month ago, he said, um, uh, thank you
very much for tonight's show. After the
week I've just had, I needed this. And
we now realize, of course, what he was
alluding to was that he was in the
middle of a breakup with Nicole. Um, uh,
I feel very sad about it to be honest. A
lot of people in Australia are very
proud of the relationships that
Australia has with the US and we like
seeing our native kin thrive. Nicole, of
course, was born in Hawaii, apparently,
so she's an American Australian, but we
still claim her as our own. And look,
Keith's a lovely man. He's a beautiful
human being. My favorite story about
Keith Urban is we did a story once on
the TV show I work for in Australia
about these little kids in a very remote
country school, Aboriginal kids who
loved music and they wrote Keith a
letter. And blow me down, he turned up
in a with a cargo hold full of guitars
and he bought every child in that class
a guitar and he sat with them on his own
back and played with them for a morning,
sang to them. Most beautiful thing that
he could possibly do. And there are
similar stories about Nicole. I feel for
both of them. Uh they're two wonderful
human beings who suffer the ignammonies
of living in the public gaze and I can
only imagine being apart from each other
for so long places huge stresses. I felt
the same way when I was working for 60
minutes Australia. I was on the road for
six or seven months of the year and it
placed huge huge stress on my
relationship. So, my heart goes out to
them and um
if you ever do get back together, your
neighbor says hi.
