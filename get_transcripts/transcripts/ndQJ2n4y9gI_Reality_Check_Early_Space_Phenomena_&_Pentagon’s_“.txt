Hello and welcome back to Reality Check.
I'm Ross Kulart and today we have a fun
guest. She's a good friend of mine, Dr.
Beatatric Villa. She's a Swedishbased
astronomer with a master's degree in
physics and a doctorate in astronomy.
And not only is she a brain box, she's
also very very interested in the subject
of ETSs. And she's spent a lot of time
leading two projects. the Vasco project,
which is the vanishing and appearing
sources during a century of observations
project, and the newly started Exo
probe, which is slowly setting up a
network of telescopes to search for ET
objects, locate them in 3D, and
characterize them. And both projects are
currently searching for nonhuman
artifacts and probes in the inner solar
system near the Earth. And if that's not
enough for her, she's far too busy for
her own good. In her free time, she has
also initiated the European UFO crash
retrieval initiative with the aim of
searching for crashed ET spaceships in
Europe, i.e. doing field trips looking
for crashed spaceships. I can tell you
Beatric Viller is a fascinating
interview. I really admire her
dedication as a scientist to covering an
issue that is so stigmatized and taboo.
Beatric, welcome to Reality Check.
>> Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.
So before we go any further, Beatric,
one of the things I love about the fact
is that you're in Sweden and everybody
in the debunking community always says
that there's nothing that happens in
euphology outside of North America. And
yet you guys at UPS, is it Upsala?
Upsala airport in Sweden have been being
buzzed recently by supposed drones. What
are they? Are we talking about something
anomalous?
>> That's a good question. And last year we
had some drones because that's what we
very often call UFOs in Sweden. Uh we
had some drones over the nuclear power
plant. So maybe it was two years ago
already. When I say last year, it could
also be the previous year. And in the
last three days, we also had drones at
the airport. And uh it was first three
days ago, then two days ago. And
yesterday when I was flying back from uh
UK to uh Sweden, there were also some
drones right before and they have uh
discussed this the Swedish police and
then they made a report to NATO and now
they have come out and said that there
is no evidence that there were any drone
sightings at all. So what to make of all
of that? We don't know. So, this is a
very similar situation to what we've
been seeing over many air force bases in
the United States. Often, there are
objects clearly reported by locals,
civilians, and military personnel on the
bases. They're called drones because
that's the useful explanation, and it's
also a more neutral one. But, um, is the
suspicion that there was something
anomalous happening oversala airport?
Well, I think those in the UFO community
are of course wondering if these are
UFOs rather than any drones.
>> So tell me, Betrus, are you a are you a
believer? Have you seen anything
anomalous yourself in your career?
>> I never seen a UFO. I just hope to see
one. Yesterday I was when I was flying
back from UK, I was hoping to see a UFO
um in the window. Of course, we were
flying through the clouds. I saw nothing
and it was dark uh outside and light
inside. So it was impossible to see
anything.
>> You're like me. I mean my friends who
have seen UFOs, they tell me that
whatever they are, the non-human
intelligences are doing this to keep me
skeptical. So So maybe it's the same
with you. Maybe you're more effective as
a scientist by being kept skeptical. So
let's let's talk about your projects.
The Vasco project. Can you explain it to
me please?
So um the vanishing and appearing
sources during a century of observation
project it started with a search for
vanishing stars uh in 2016. So we
started with the idea of that one could
look for some objects that let's say
some star that is there in in old images
and then one day they vanish because we
hope to see some kind of super advanced
civilization that just would go and kill
off a star or turn it into a black hole
or something like that. We never found
those things. But we found something
super interesting that was different and
that we found like some images where you
can see multiple objects that look like
star appearing and vanishing within half
an hour. Now that was something we
didn't expect to see and
um that was something also that we are
still working with because when you work
with the Vasco project the main thing is
that we use plates from the early 1950s
when there were no satellites in the
sky. This is like
um it's like imagine you have a sky that
is completely clean from all human
condemnation. No space debris because
today you have like millions of pieces
that are blinking uh blinking pieces of
space debris and uh you have so much of
garbage outside the earth while if you
go back to these early images it was
clean. So the very first human object in
space was the Russian Sputnik satellite.
That was 1957. Am I right?
>> Yes.
>> So before that there wouldn't have been
any artificial human objects in space.
Correct.
>> Exactly. Unless there were some black
programs that they will not tell us
about.
>> And what have you found? Obviously the
slides that you're talking about, these
are glass plate slides. What observatory
slides were you using?
>> So we were using um glass or like
digitized glass plates. So they have
actually digitized all these images or
not all many of them from the Palomar
Observatory which is in California. So
it's
>> so that's on the west coast of the
United States.
>> Exactly. And so we have used those uh
and we compared them to Pan Stars which
is uh from 2013 and 2015. uh 10 years
ago and we compared the images of the
sky and we looked for while we were
looking for vanishing stars. Suddenly
one day and this actually for as a fun
thing this happened exactly the same
week as the pandemic started in Europe
uh that I found this image of nine stars
that were there on the 12th of April
1950 and that were not there again and
couldn't be seen there half an hour
earlier either.
So some so some of these slides so some
of these slides were taken within half
an hour of each other. That that's the
really useful thing. You can actually
show a period of time where a bright
object or objects were in the in in the
sky somewhere in space above our planet
visible to a telescope and then half an
hour later they weren't there.
It looks like that and we want to know
whether this is a real observation
because uh one thing that people tell us
is like oh but maybe these are just some
kind of plate defects but when you think
about plate defects I mean a defect it's
something random that kind of a random
um thing that happens on the plate that
maybe in one case you will see something
that looks like a star but what we do is
that we actually measure the brightness
profiles of these object objects and we
compare them to the real stars in the
field and what you see on the nine stars
these nine transients is that they their
brightness profiles is identical of the
real stars in the field of uh that have
the same intensities as these stars. So
>> So what does that what does that mean?
Why is that relevant? Why is it
>> I think these are no plate defects.
That's what I think.
>> So a plate defect would have a different
brightness profile. it presumably be a
lot brighter
>> random shapes and maybe different
brightness profiles being like either
much let's say wobblier or you I mean
plate defics also string kind of strings
and streaks and anything is a random
thing I wouldn't expect to look
identical to stars so that's why I think
these are real observations
>> so you call these transients so they're
essentially transients because they're
objects that are appearing on a slide in
one exposure, but they're not there in
another.
>> Exactly. And if you would let let's say
if you would think that what you're
seeing is some kind of asteroid, then
the weird thing is that let's say if you
would have an asteroid that moves so
fast that it's there in one image and
not the other, it wouldn't leave a point
source that looks like a star. It would
leave a streak as it moves. And the same
with meteors.
>> So these were stationary objects.
They're not moving.
Whatever we see looks like indeed
stationary objects that are far away
from us.
>> Okay. So obviously what you and I are
really interested in is techno
signatures. The possibility that these
might be craft or maybe some kind of
Dyson sphere, something that's
emblematic of a technologically advanced
civilization.
Maybe a a spacecraft hovering in space
somewhere possibly in orbit. How do you
delineate between that extreme
possibility of a non-human intelligence
and other natural explanations? What are
the natural explanations that as an
astronomer you have to take into account
to consider are possible explanations?
>> So we have taken all kind of natural
explanations into account and looked at
it and there's no natural explanation
that can give you nine objects that
appear and vanish within half an hour.
uh so that's why the plate defect was
the only thing we could come up with as
a potential uh like a potential
explanation except for that I don't
think it is that because of the reasons
I already explained uh so one thing that
uh let's say if we would see this today
with the same instrumentation let's say
we use polymer today and we take the
glass plates then you would be able to
see this all the time because you have
satellites and you have space debris and
you'll have flat metallic surfaces that
will be reflecting the sunlight and give
off short uh glint subsecond uh solar
reflections that look like transients.
So if you see today it wouldn't be
magical but again this is 1950 so it's
something it it doesn't add up and
that's why I'm so interested. I want to
know are we seeing artificial objects
around the earth in 1950?
We live in one of the most advanced eras
in human history. We've never had as
many medical breakthroughs assisting our
health as we have in this current era.
And yet at this exact same time, there
are millions of Americans who are
suffering unhealthiness and obesity in
what is an epidemic of tragedy caused by
bad food. So what's going on? According
to a US boardcertified physician and
expert nutritionist, Dr. Amy Lee. One of
the major reasons is three harmful foods
that are being passed off as health
foods all over the country. And wait
till you hear this. Because these foods
can cause weight gain, clog your
digestive tract, deplete your energy,
and wreck your skin. They're actually
banned in other countries. They're
forbidden to be put into foods. Yet,
shockingly, they're still legal in the
United States. And it's time someone
shined a light on what they are. Dr. Amy
Lee does just that while explaining how
the side effects from these foods are
wreaking havoc on the health of millions
of Americans. The great news is it's
easy to stop and reverse this damage by
simply learning which of these foods to
avoid and how to spot them. And by doing
so, you can experience easier weight
loss, smooth digestion, and vibrant
energy. To find out these three fake
health foods, go to

Okay. So, let's before we get to the
issue of artificial objects or
potentially artificial objects, which is
by far the most exciting aspect of your
research, can I just explore with you
what might be some of the natural
explanations that you've had to consider
to to rule out those natural
explanations? I think one of them is
something called gravitational lensing.
when the gravity of an adjacent
celestial object somehow distorts light
and bends that light and obscures that
light. Can you explain that to me
please?
>> Yes. Uh so if if you would have a
gravitational lensing there
like effect from gravitational lensing
you could expect uh maybe some kind of
changes in all of all stars in that same
field. However, we only see of these
nine stars and all the other ones are
unaffected.
>> So, gravit
gravitational lensing out. Uh, what
about say a supernova or something like
that?
>> Well, it's extremely unlikely to have
nine supernova happening there all at
the same time. And also, they usually
take months is not half an hour.
And you've already explained that it
couldn't be a meteor or a comet because
if it was you would get a streak in the
exposure because it was moving. Is that
correct?
>> Exactly.
>> So what are the other is there any other
explanation natural explanation that as
good scientists we ought to be
considering?
>> Well, we were thinking about uh um for
example uh well we were thinking about
supernova. What else were we thinking
about? I already forgot everything we
were thinking about. But what we what we
did was that we looked at uh let's say a
phenomenon and we looked at the typical
rates. How how frequently does this
happen on the sky? And you can see that
all these things like supernoval and uh
microl lensing events all those are
happening far more rare and uh
definitely not in such a small area of
the sky. So we could just ignore all of
that.
>> So let me be very clear in this. So what
you see are nine objects in one
particular region of the night sky. It's
not disperate all over the visible
>> sky. So it was nine objects in one
particular region. Are you able to
isolate what area of space it was? Was
it in orbit? Was it far out? Are you
able to figure that out from the slides?
>> One image. And that's what's the problem
with the Vasco project. We have one
single image. You can't say how far out
it is. It could even be in principle
somewhere inside the atmosphere but very
very high up. It's just that um we can't
tell that from one single image. Imagine
if you would have some nine objects that
would pop into existence high up inside
the atmosphere. It could also look like
that. So we need actually that's why we
need exop probe where we can actually
localize them and tell the distance.
>> So I'll get to exop probe but I first
want to hear now. So, we've ruled out
all the possible natural explanations.
You're talking about nine transient
objects that appeared on a slide in I
think did you say 1950?
>> Uh that was 12th of April 1950.
>> 1950 and they're not there in a slide
half an hour later.
>> Exactly.
>> So,
>> maybe that's earlier actually. And then
we looked also 6 days later and we
looked 30 years later and we looked at
we even took the world's largest
telescope
the Grand Telescopio Canarius which is a
10.4 meter telescopes and we went super
deep and we looked at this this place
and there was nothing there and we said
okay here we use this very big telescope
and there's nothing on the place. So
>> and what do we know about the time the
date of when this exposure happened when
these nine objects appeared? Is there is
is is there any significance in that
date in 1950 at all?
>> We checked it. We didn't find anything
special on the 12th of April 1950.
>> So what was it, Beatatric?
>> I don't know. I wish I knew.
>> But but can we assume that one potential
plausible explanation is that whatever
they were, they were artificial?
>> Yes,
>> they were there. They were they were
capable whatever they were they were
there one minute when a slide was taken
and then half an hour later they weren't
there when another slide was taken.
>> Exactly. And if I can spin further on
your thoughts if I may. Um we have um uh
later we we kept on working with uh like
searching for new examples. For example,
um I was thinking about that one way how
you can actually show that it's not
plate defects is if you find several of
them that are aligned on a line because
that would be something that comes also
with the movement. And uh we wrote a
paper, we published it in actra
Astronautica about how to do this search
and the referees were happy with the way
how we suggested how one would search
for it with the statistics. And then
finally we made a search and we actually
found two examples that were
statistically significant where you can
see several along a line. So here is one
image and what you can see here is that
you have five objects that are aligned
along a narrow strip as you can see
here. And the probability to have this
by chance is 1 in 10,000. It's a
so-called uh 4.2 sigma statistical
significance on this detection.
>> And what does that mean for for a bear
with a very simple brain beer? What does
that mean? What what do we
>> the chance to get uh five transients uh
aligned on a line or just five objects
aligned on a line in such a image is 1
in 10,000 is very small and you can see
this example here and on top of that
>> could they be spacecraft I mean is it
plausible is it plausible
>> yeah I mean essentially what what lot
what's behind all of this is the
implication is that these are artificial
objects of some kind perhaps nonhuman
spacecraft
>> and to make it even better it happens on
a date but we didn't know that because
we posted it on archive with an first
with an error in the table where I had
the wrong date I converted it wrongly
now we have corrected it well still not
on archive but we already know that the
correct date is that it happened this
our best example on the 27th of July
1952 which to me when we when we wrote
the paper was an obscure date. However,
later my colleague Enrique Solano found
a beautiful example of three transients
that uh again like very they were the
brightest and most beautiful of all our
examples where you see three transients
appearing and vanishing again within
half an hour. Here you can see the three
beautiful stars. You see it in one image
but you don't see it in the other. And
this one happen happens on the 19th of
July 1952. And that is when a friend of
mine, David Altman, pointed out, hey, do
you know what this date is? I said, no,
I have no idea. Well, it's a very famous
date. Uh, this Washington DC UFO flap. I
said, oh, really? So, I went and looked
at that. Wow, that's a coincidence.
>> Can I can I This is just such a precious
piece of research. I love this. This is
good science finding something
potentially anomalous which cannot be
explained naturally. There's no prosaic
explanation that explains what we're
talking about here. So you've got two
dates in July of 1952.
One the week after the other. One's the
19th of July and the other's the 27th of
July. Correct.
>> Yes. And I had never heard about the
Washington DC flap when we found these
things. That's the best part.
>> And one of the greatest sightings in UFO
history. It's one of the most recorded
incidents in UFO history was the
notorious, as you say, Washington UFO
flap in 1952.
And it was when on two consecutive
weekends,
UFOs, apparent craft, certainly
intelligently guided objects of some
kind, were detected on multiple radar
systems, military and civilian, over
Washington. And it's funny because, you
know, everybody talks about why don't
the aliens come and land on the White
House lawn. In this case, they didn't
land on the White House lawn, but they
flew allegedly right across Washington
DC's very highly protected secure
airspace in a formation in a fleet. And
it really does beg the question, have
you inadvertently
with good science captured image of
something that was potentially either in
upper orbit or in orbit itself or near
Earth orbit, which may in fact have been
associated with these objects on those
exact same dates.
I wonder the same because I don't know
if this is some highly uh unusual
coincidences that we happen to find
these unusual extreme anomalies exactly
on these dates on these two dates
because if it would be one of them it
would be a coincidence when you have two
of them you have a bigger coincidence
and now of course I'm wondering if there
is much more that can be found in these
plates where you could actually find a
correlation with known UFO sightings and
that's something I hope or we're
actually working on right Oh. Um,
>> so big work.
>> Just explain this to me. So
are you able to say with any definitive
conclusion that these are artificial
objects? Like what conclusion
legitimately can we reach based on what
you know? You know that in a period
shortly before the 19th of July 1952 and
the 27th of July 1952, other photographs
were taken and those transient objects
were not there. But in those specific
dates which correlate to the Washington
flyover, they were there. I mean what
what's a legitimate scientific
conclusion to reach? You tell me.
>> I cannot make a conclusion of this yet.
What I can do is to form a hypothesis
and say that it seems that there is a
strong correlation between multiple
transients and UFO events and that in
case we can show this correlation in a
strong way, we would actually find
support for that we see uh artificial
object that UFOs are related to
artificial objects.
>> Wow.
I mean, you might have captured the
implication. The implication of this
though, Beatric, is that you may very
well have captured proof of perhaps some
kind of mother ship or perhaps these
craft that were flying over Washington
in orbit.
>> It's possible. I I but I would like to
find better proof to convince myself.
Now, are the images that you're talking
about, were they also from the Palomar
Observatory in California? And and
what's the likelihood that the field of
space seen over the western USA might be
relevant to what we're talking about,
which was over Washington DC in the
eastern USA?
>> Well, if they are outside the Earth,
then of course, if you have some mother
ship coming there, maybe you will see
something even from Palomar. But if it's
of course maybe it's more likely that
you're going to see it better if you are
at Harvard Observatory that is much
closer and that's where you had the
largest photographic plate collection in
the world.
>> Okay, so that's my next question. I mean
Harvard's just down the road in Boston.
Um is there any plates that you can look
at from that period to try to cross
reference and perhaps even triangulate
what it was that was seen from Palomar.
So two days ago I got an email from
Harvard emailing list that the dash
project now are are back on feet and
that's a project that has worked a lot
with um digitizing uh a lot of Harvard
plates that have been there. So Harvard
have been taking place for 150 years.
They have more than 500,000 plates. They
had a little bit of a special story, but
this plate collection is this plate
collection is extraordinary.
Um, the telescopes are smaller and don't
go as deep as the Palomar observatories,
but they have so much that you can build
light curves from.
>> Now, there's a bit of a story, isn't
there? While we're talking about
Harvard, there's a bit of a story about
Harvard because one of the chief
astronomers at Harvard for many years
was a guy called Donald Mensel. What can
you tell me about what you've discovered
happened at Harvard?
>> There's a little bit there are some
details that really make me wonder. To
start with, uh, about Donald Mensel, he
was very famous as a UFO debunker. Maybe
the most famous UFO debunker of his
time.
>> He was a scathing, let's be, let's be
cruel about it. He was a scathing
debunker. a person who really put the
boot in to anybody who suggested that
there was any truth at all to the idea
that UFOs might be nonhuman
intelligences. He ran a tough viciferous
campaign for many many years. And it
turns out he did in fact have very close
associations with the intelligence and
defense community in the US. That only
came out after his death. And even more
fun, he was uh the person that was in
contact with General Sam Ford when they
arranged this big press conference on
the 29th of July 1952 for the Washington
DC flap and he explained ah these are
just weather disturbances their radar
operators were incompetent and uh so he
was in close connection with the US Air
Force and now the interesting thing is
that two or three months later he
becomes uh director of Harvard and as a
first thing he does when he becomes as
director of Harvard is that he goes and
destroys onethird of the plate
collection. He asks his secretary to get
rid of the plates and some other place
he just uh throws into a basement when
the astronomers are complaining. So
there's a famous American astronomer
called Dory Tofflight that tells about
this entire uh situation with the
photographic plates when Donald Mansel
comes in as director and she became
persona nongata because she really
didn't get along with Dr. Menel and she
writes about it in a chapter in her
autobiography. So I really recommend
everyone who are interested to read
that. And even more interesting he not
only destroys onethird of the plates he
also destroys some of the log books and
for 15 years from 1953 to 1967 he stops
the survey. So the Harvard astronomical
survey doesn't anymore scar the sky. So
you have 15 years is called a mental gap
when it didn't scar the sky.
>> Beatus, why, okay, let's be fair about
this. Why would a scientist, a a person
dedicated to the study of astronomy, why
would they want to destroy onethird of
what I presume was a scientifically
priceless collection of images going
back many, many years? What what what's
the rationale for that?
>> I wonder the same. Some people will say
he was a theoretical physicist. Maybe it
has something to do with storage. But
for me, it's a completely insane thing
that someone would take all this work
that there so many hundreds of people
that dedicated themselves to do these
plates and would just destroy them.
There was there was not even any reason
to do it because they were so high
quality.
>> Has Harvard provided any explanation for
why Dr. Mensel did what he did?
I haven't heard anything from them, but
they themselves on their website talk
about the mental gap when it comes to
stopping the survey, which is two
different episodes. It's not the plate
destruction, but they refer to the
mental gap on their web page when he
just stopped the survey.
>> I mean, let's be honest about it. It's
quite sinister. I mean, you have a
person who was involved in personally
debunking the Washington flyover
incidents and trying to explain them
away as anomalous weather events, which
was manifestally untrue. and he's
involved in essentially destroying
evidence that might have allowed further
corroboration of that incident.
>> So it's it's even like some of the
things that I'm learning now, I'm
writing a new paper, is that there was a
exciting project called Moon Watch uh
that started in 57 at the same time as
they were uh as the first satellite was
launched. And so it was Mensel's ex-PhD
student. So they and also I think it was
his best friend if I understand that
from Stanton Friedman's works. Um so
Fred Whipple and Manel were close and
Fred Whipple started this moon watch
project which was about searching for
kind of all artificial objects. Um uh in
those times they were tracking
satellites and they had 12 station all
around the earth and a lot of citizen
scientists who are helping to track this
uh satellites and that is al also how
heck apparently came into this entire
topic because if I understand it
correctly he was working with a moon
watch. So I think Harvard in 50s must
have been amazingly interesting like for
astronomers to be at. Do we know what
slides were destroyed? Do we know for
sure if the 1952 slides that might have
been taken by the Harvard Observatory in
that period that you're talking about in
July 1952, were they destroyed by the
order?
>> I have no idea. I have no idea. I simply
don't know what was destroyed, what
wasn't destroyed, and what was the
reason behind. And I find it very weird
this sum of coincent coincidences that
lead up to u this destruction and add to
it that Mensel also had his famous
reputation in the UFO community. So I
mean he's a perfect arc villain.
>> We really don't know. So we really don't
know at the moment. Are there any Let me
ask you this way. Are there any slides
that you know of held by Harvard
University's astronomy section which
might allow you to look at that area of
night sky in that period of July 1957?
>> I have no idea. But what I would like to
do is of course to look at this dash
catalog now since it's up again this
database and investigate if there's some
material that can be helpful. So it
might be that they I mean we just don't
know yet because they haven't done the
digitization.
>> I think they are they are finalizing the
digitization now and they there have
been a lot of up and downs with the web
page. It has been off and then it has
been on off and on and now it should be
up again and I I'm very happy that they
have completed this project because I
think that collection is maybe one of
the most treasure it was called most
valuable data collections uh in
astronomy
>> but let's be blunt about this Beatric at
the heart of this there is clearly the
suspicion that one of the most prominent
UFO debunkers of the era
misused his position as the head
astronomer at Harvard to destroy
potential evidence of non-human
intelligence.
>> It's a possible explanation.
>> Wow, that's very serious. Um, let's talk
now about the exop probe project which
uh involves you setting up a proposed
network of telescopes to look for ET
objects. What is exop probe and how does
it work?
>> So Exoprobe, it has taken us a little
bit of a while to get it started because
uh when you buy a telescope through the
university, it usually takes one year
before you put the order until it
arrives uh at the observatory. So
imagine now we had the trouble with
these plates that we have one image
everywhere. So you can't say tell the
distance. You can't even for sure know
that it's real objects you are seeing
because you still wonder what if there's
some kind of error in the image that you
just didn't think about that would
produce something false. So you still
always play with this possibility that
what if it's not real and we don't want
to have that ambiguity anymore. So, Exop
Probe builds on that you you create a
network of telescope or you build it
over time this network of telescopes and
by having multiple telescopes watching
one region of the sky. You can directly
verify if something is real because you
will see it in more more than one
telescope
>> and I presume you could also you could
triangulate as well. Could you calculate
distance?
>> Exactly. So you can calculate this
distance if it's inside a solar system
you're going to be able to triangulate
it uh or like we like we talk about we
measure the parallax and uh you will get
the distance you can localize it in 3D
but also we have a telescope that is
taking spectrum in a wider field so you
directly characterize it the object so
you can do all so let's say you get
three transients appearing and vanishing
at the same time when you do the exop
probe you will be able to catch these
three transients you will be able to
localize them if they are let's say
inside a solar system you will directly
estimate where they are and you will get
a spectrum that will tell you if this is
a solar reflection that you're dealing
with or if it's some weird emission from
some something that you have never seen
and you see some weird lines and a very
weird spectrum and no matter what you
what you get you will get information
and that's what exoprobe is about and
the more telescopes you have the more
accurate uh the 3D localization. So, how
far apart do the telescopes have to be
to be able to triangulate? And I I just
for our audience's benefit, for those
who don't understand what I mean,
essentially if you if you know the
distance between the two telescopes on
Earth.
>> Yeah. So, we are interested.
>> So, we are interested in looking at
geocynchronous orbits uh and beyond. We
don't want to be too close to the earth.
And then I we are going to have two
telescopes separated by let's say 15
kilometers. We still need to get the
second telescope for this 15 km. And we
hope also in the future to get uh two
telescopes separated by 1,500 km, let's
say one in New Mexico, another in
California. And then you can see out to
let's say half the way to Mars uh and
look at objects that far out. And um I
think this is the range where we are
going to operate in like inner solar
system. So, so let's say there's, you
know, Zug from planet Zeta Reticuli is
chugging along in his hyperspectral
cruiser flying somewhere in our solar
system trying to avoid detection by us
humans because of the prime directive.
What your exop probe could do is it
could show how far away his craft is.
Uh, could you could you show anything
about the size of the craft? Could you
calculate the size of the object?
>> We could, but we would need more than
one detection and we would need to
establish a pattern more or less of this
object, how it's blinking, and then we
could estimate the size.
>> So, how many of these exop probe
telescopes do you have at the moment?
>> Right now, we have uh one single
telescope, the exop probe that we are
now installing, the first one. Then we
have our collaborators of space laser
awareness that are complementing with a
telescope for taking the spectrum. And
we are trying to of course to do
fundraising for the remaining
telescopes. We will or find people who
want to collaborate with us. That's
something also that we want to do. Maybe
someone who is in the New Mexico,
California area and has a telescope
plane wave wants to provide a third
telescope and a fourth so that we can
really um triangulate in good ways.
So betus potentially you are in a
position where with either the Vasco or
the exo probe you could uncover evidence
of a potential non-human intelligence uh
perhaps even in orbit.
>> Yes, I hope that we might and I hope
that we will. H
>> how would you ever be able to
definitively confirm? I mean obviously
you can show a transient with the vasco
and you can calculate obviously the size
of an object and the distance of an
object with the exo probe. What would be
the way of corroborating that it is in
fact something non-human that it's an
artificial object?
>> Well, let's say uh we know let's say we
know all the artificial objects that are
far out from the satellite orbits. we
know which objects human have sent. And
imagine you now find an object that is
unlisted and it's far away. It's let's
say it's uh somewhere halfway to Mars
and nobody knows what it is but you know
it's artificial and you and you can
guess that from the spectrum and then
you say okay this is unlisted nobody's
admitting to it this looks very
interesting let's try to communicate
with it you can try to communicate but
then you could also actually make a
space mission to go and fetch that
object and pick it up if you find
something really interesting
or maybe you see some fantastically
weird spectrum and weird emission, some
weird plasma, who knows what else.
>> Now, the third feather in your cap,
Beatric, is you've also been involved in
creating the European UFO Crash
Retrieval Initiative, which if anybody's
interested, it's um a website called
www.ecrinitiative.org.org.
Tell me about that.
>> So that's an idea um that we started
with in uh actually around the 16th of
December last year. It's just a hobby
thing. It's on a very let's say it's a
thing we do a bit in our free time and
we are we have created a database. Vasco
is hosting on the database where we um
encourage everyone in Europe to submit
uh what they know about crashed UFOs and
we really mean nonhuman objects. We
don't want to get any missiles or
something like that. It's interesting.
We have a number of people have
submitted the sightings. Then there are
some we also have an Australian sighting
but we know that Australia is part of
Eurovvision nowadays. And um
so we have been looking at them. We had
one one suggestion that was really good
that we later backtracked from we we
were thinking of doing a field trip to
somewhere in Europe where there was a a
leech uh crash UFO but then we actually
bailed out because of several
circumstances. We thought that maybe
we'll wait for something new.
I can imagine I can imagine you're
treading on toes here because I I I'm
aware of allegations of five eyes
countries i.e. UK, USA, Australia, New
Zealand, Canada being involved in
collaboration with European countries in
what are alleged retrievalss of nonhuman
craft. But I can imagine that's all very
very top secret. Aren't you treading on
toes here by soliciting public
information into your group for
information on crash retrievals? Well,
we only are asking for information about
uh flying saucers that have crashed and
according to the authorities there are
no uh aliens here on the earth. So they
shouldn't be bothered. We are not doing
anything that is bothering anyone. So if
they are right about that then all is
fine. It's a little bit interesting that
when I've been talking about this in
three different occasions, we were
hacked within two days the web page.
>> You think you think the intelligence
services are taking a closer interest
than they care to admit in what you're
doing?
>> I guess we will discover after the
interview.
>> Can I ask you this? Have you had
convincing evidence presented to you by
good sources suggesting that there is
possible UFO crashes and retrievals that
have taken place in Europe?
>> I haven't been convinced yet by what we
have uh received and I hope that we'll
get something better. So
>> have you have you been invited by any
political group or political
organization? Are there any governments
taking any interest in your work?
Um I was uh at the European Parliament
on the 20th of March uh presenting
uh there was a small meeting at the
European Parliament organized by
Francisco Gueredo where I talked about
uh science and UFOs. I also presented
some of these from the Washington flap.
I thought that this has to be known.
>> U and Francisco Guerrero is a a
Portuguese member of the European
Parliament. I think he's soon to leave
the parliament. He's not he's not
renewing his um tenure there, but he's
taken a very close interest in the
phenomenon and the possibility that
there have been cover-ups, governments
involved in retrievalss of non-human
craft that have been kept secret from
the public. What was the reception you
received inside the parliament? Was it
just Mr. Guerrero or did you get other
members of parliament taking an
interest? Um
I didn't uh uh uh what's called talk too
much to people afterwards. So I kind of
I think people were very positive inside
the room. Uh I also were contacted
afterwards by
uh some people including someone from
the European Commission who wanted to
talk to me after this. So I think there
were there was some interest but there
is still a stigma. So people are quite
shy about it.
Is there an interest though? I mean,
this this is what I'm drilling for. I
mean, there's there's a lot of
debunker suggestions that this is all
nonsense that the Pentagon has suggested
there is nothing to all of this nonsense
about UFOs, that David Grush is
obviously batshit crazy. Um, the whole
thing is a joke and we should all just
go back to our lives and ignore this
nonsense about UFOs. Is that the
impression you're getting from the
European political leadership?
>> Um, well, I don't know anything about
the European politics because I don't
follow politics at all. But my
impression is that there is far too much
of interest from
certain groups of people
that are professional into the topic in
order to dismiss everything. And I think
I I prefer to leave it at that and not
not go deeper into what I mean. I I I
can say it has
>> changed my life in some ways digging
into this topic. So I was a hard kind of
very agnostic two years ago and now I
believe much more that this is a topic
that has to be
>> what what what has convinced you? What
what has been the moment the tipping
point the um you know the moment when
you realized I really do need to take
this seriously? Well, there were several
things that happened to me. The first
the Washington uh plates of course is
was a very big thing like realizing
these weird coincidences realizing the
thing with mental. A third thing is that
I was one of those who was fed with the
stigma in some ways like I grew I was
marinated in the stigma as a scientist
for a long time and I thought that oh
all the people who work with UFOs are a
little bit weird or crazy because I seen
this you know they show you some TV
documentary series in Sweden and you
look at these people say oh you know I
don't have much in common with them you
think a little and then you realize you
meet the people who work with UFOs
school and it's super talented,
brilliant, smart, successful,
much more healthier in all possible ways
than normal academics. I seriously
believe that there's a much uh like
healthier attitude to life among the
eupfologists and among the academics.
And
>> a lot of a lot of those people are
scientists too, aren't they? I mean
there's a lot of people in science who
you and I know who are taking a very
close interest in this subject but they
don't want to flag publicly their
interest. Um a lot of scientists are
engaging with this phenomenon like never
before. Is that your experience?
>> Exactly. It's a lot of scientists who
are very engaged in that. Um it's it's
really a lot of scientists. I think
there is also some intelligence services
interested in scientists who work on
that and I will not say anything more
about it but um that has also been
something that has made me think that it
seems to be really serious and people
don't understand how serious it is. So I
suspect I might be wrong but my
impression at this moment is that
the stigma has been really I support the
people who who think that the stigma was
uh carefully designed and where stigma
didn't help to stop the scientist enter
the parties to stop to try to slow down
the scientists. That's my impression.
Can I ask you this? As as a scientist
and especially as a female scientist
working in this field, have you been
subjected to if you like stigmatizing
treatment? Have you been ostracized in
any way by your professional colleagues?
>> Yes. And it's a longer story. I don't
know if there's time to take it but um
um so
it's for me started in 2021 in May 20 or
actually end of May or beginning of June
2021 uh when we found these nine
transients
and as uh I published it and one of my
um colleagues was uh is or my second
author on that paper is Marcy. So Jeff
Marcy is a very very famous astronomer
from the exoplanet community because he
together with the dear Kos and and um um
now I I I lose the names. Michelle Mayor
the exoplanet guys who got the Nobel
Prize. He actually discovered the first
exoplanets and they were like all
working on this um first exoplanets and
he was nominated for Nobel Prize.
However, in 2015, 3 months after he gets
uh this hundred u million dollar grant,
which is the largest grant ever to
search for um extraterrestrial
intelligence, 3 months after he suddenly
gets into sexual harassment scandal. I
didn't know him that time, but uh he got
into this uh scandal and but he kept on
working. He published papers. He
retired. He retired and left his
position. he left this breakthrough list
and that he was supposed to lead the
SETI uh program and kept kind of
publishing. But however, exactly that
week as we got our nine transients paper
accepted. By pure coincidence, the
National Academy of Sciences announced
that they are removing Jeff as a first
person ever from the National Academy of
Sciences and they do a press
announcement. So it's written in the
science journal, it's a nature journal.
And then suddenly everyone jump on me uh
for how can you work with Jeff
and I start getting excluded from from
conferences. I get horrible social media
comments. Uh I get unpleasant phone
calls. Uh it has been so many things
happening since I've been blocked from
conferences. Basically my astronomy
career was kind of has been closing at
that time. But the problem here is like
like for example
uh I had one offer that came from the
seti institute about like applying to
become affiliate. If you become
affiliate it means you can get grants
and this came at the same time as they
knew that they would be getting $200
million. So it was a great career
opportunity to become an affiliate and
later maybe see if I could get some
support. But then they asked me or told
me that if I wanted to become an
affiliate, I had to drop Jeff Marcy from
all papers and from collaborations. And
I just couldn't do that. It just wasn't
the right thing to do. This is my
collaborator. And for me, I'm a really a
human rights believer. For me, human
rights is something so important. I
believe in the right for a due process.
Jeff Marson never had a due process. He
was never in court. And I believe in the
right for redemption. even if someone
did something bad 20 years ago, they
shouldn't be hunted forever. And these
two things and and the right to be
treated with dignity. And since I'm a
human rights um activist in that way, I
just couldn't accept this offer from the
set institute. And since then of course
I get rejected from conferences and um
they have been it's astronomy professors
doing that and I keep resisting what
they want me to do and I will keep
working with Jeff as long as we enjoy
the collaboration.
>> Do you believe that you are being
ostracized
because of your stand on searching for
extraterrestrial intelligence in part? I
I think both things enter here and it's
also possible that there is that some
academics who are
working who are emotional about that I
work with Jeff also are being useful to
some other parties who don't want people
to work with UFOs. I don't know. I think
it's such a mess there. I I know you
recently prepared a paper for an
international conference on astrobiology
and the future of life and I was sorry
to hear it was rejected and the real the
really puzzling aspect about it was that
you'd written an abstract about your
esco exop probe and vasco projects where
you're searching for alien artifacts
near earth and that was sent to a
conference I think it was in Houston
which is essentially looking at the
issue of techno signature i.e. ET
signatures.
Were you rejected? Is that correct that
you were knocked back for a paper with
that conference?
>> Yes. But a miracle happened. One hour
ago, I received a new email where they
changed their mind and they're inviting
me now.
>> Oh, fantastic. That's great news about
it. So, they inviting me for a poster
and I will accept it and I'm very
grateful for that. There was a change in
the decision.
>> Oh, that's wonderful. things can be it
shows that things can be changed and
things can be improved and I'm happy
that they made that decision at the
organizing committee. Thank you.
>> Ultimately what you're all about as far
as I can see Beatric is good solid
science and there shouldn't be areas of
science should there where we fear to
tread because of stigma and taboo. Do
you agree?
>> I completely agree. I don't I I strongly
believe in academic freedom and I
believe in the freedom of the thought.
If someone tells me that something is
forbidden and I mean if you look at the
city thing I mean where it's okay to
look for signatures far far away but
it's not okay to look inside the solar
system. I mean that's a ridiculous
thing. It's so limited by human
imagination
that yeah I don't see a reason for
stigma. But but really at the heart of
this, you have a suspicion, don't you,
that one of the reasons that you were
ostracized by some in astronomy is
because you've been looking perhaps a
little bit close to home.
>> Yes. I think u I wonder if this story
would have happened if we would have
never found these nine transients and
just kept on searching for vanishing
stars and publishing something
completely different. Zero results. I
really wonder if it if all these things
that would have happened.
>> It really does make me wonder though,
Beatatric, whether there's other cases
that we could look for. I mean, it's
quite exciting the idea that there might
be in the archives of astronomical
observatories all around the world.
Evidence that it can be digitized and
then matched with today's imagery to see
those evidences of transients, objects
that were in our night sky that are no
longer there. It really does beg the
question if all along there's been
evidence sitting right under our noses
that might corroborate things that we're
only now in the process of beginning to
understand. It's a very exciting area of
science. I think it's fascinating that
you're doing it.
>> I think so too. And I what what I
suspect is that many times there is
evidence there right under the nose but
people scientists maybe when they see
something unexpected in many ways they
react with oh it has to be wrong because
this I mean I get if you get marinated
in the stigma your instinct is to reject
anything that is anomalous and
>> and you're you're looking I understand
for funding for your exop probe project.
you need help getting the funding to do
the exop probe research. Is that
correct?
>> Uh well, I have two years now of um that
I'm paid to work on exop probe. But yes,
in order to be able to triangulate, we
would need funding maybe for one or two
additional telescopes or we would need
collaborators who would want to step in
and join us in these searches that have
access to these telescopes. So it's the
alternative also.
>> Well, Dr. Beatatric Viller, I I think
everybody watching this would think that
the work that you're doing is
commendable and you've grown you've
shown great scientific rigor in doing
the work that you're doing. So
congratulations on on the work that
you've done to date and we wish you the
very best for your future projects.
>> Thank you.
>> And thank you very much for joining
reality check. Dr. Beatatric Villerol,
thanks for joining us. We look forward
to having you back sometime soon when
you've got more exciting discoveries to
tell us about.
>> I look forward a lot to Thank you a lot
for inviting me. It was a pleasure to
talk.
[Music]
>> Hello and welcome back to Reality Check.
Now, this week we have a very
interesting guest with some very
interesting new information about what's
really been going on behind the scenes
in Congress on the issue of UAPs. I have
two words to say to you viewers.
Immaculate constellation.
So, Michael Shelonburgger is a
professor, author, and journalist who's
been very outspoken on issues such as
free speech, censorship, homelessness in
the environment. Most recently, he's
been warning of the dangers of the
encroaching threat of censorship by
governments, media companies, and NOS.
But it was Michael's sources on the
subject of UAP's UFOs that first caught
our attention in September last year
when he published a story revealing 30
whistleblowers working for the federal
government or government contractors had
come forward to give evidence or
protected disclosures to the office of
the intelligence community inspector
general or the DoD's inspector general,
the defense inspector general or to
Congress. And in that article, he
disclosed how testimony included both
first and secondhand accounts of crash
retrievalss of UAP craft, reverse
engineering programs by the US, the
Russians, and the Chinese government,
and the testing of materials obtained
from retrieved craft, active and ongoing
government disinformation operations,
kinetic military action with UAPs,
contact and collaboration, ation with
non-human intelligences and the
successful reverse engineering of a
triangle-shaped craft with
unconventional propulsion.
Now, it was Michael who had interviews
with some of those anonymous
whistleblowers back in September 23, and
his story was full of truth bombs. How
Stephanie O. Sullivan, for example, a
former associate deputy director of the
CIA and principal national principal
deputy director of national intelligence
in the office of the director of
national intelligence is aware of a UAP
crash retrieval program and reverse
engineering program. And Michael sources
said sheets denied its existence to
Senator Marco Rubio in a private
meeting. Well, he's back. Michael,
welcome to Reality Check and I'm honored
to have you on, sir. Let's talk about
this great article you've got this week,
which is Pentagon is illegally hiding
secret UFO programs from Congress,
sources allege. Tell me more, sir.
>> Hey, great to be with you, Ross. Yeah,
this is an incredible story. So, a new
whistleblower has come forward with a
written report that this person has
shared with some members of Congress and
with me and the report is quite
extraordinary. It says that there is an
unagnowledged
special access program called Immaculate
Constellation which is the parent
program is the language used for exactly
what you said UAP crash retrieval uh
reverse engineering and apparently a
very large database of high quality
photographs, videos, infrared videos uh
apparently much more sophisticated
documentation of many more UAP
encounters than have been released. And
so without the article is really about
the allegation that this program exists
and that it has been withheld from
Congress
illegally. I think it's important for
viewers to understand that the first
article of the United States
Constitution
requires congressional oversight of all
of the activities of the executive
branch of the United States government.
So whether or not you think there are
extra terrestrials or nonhuman
intelligence or anything, even if you
think that all of this is just some sort
of advanced craft, the allegation here
by a new whistleblower verified by other
sources in a position to know is that uh
the Pentagon has the defense department
has has withheld kept secret this
information from Congress, which is a
viol violation of the constitution and
illegal. So I think that what we're
looking at here is really a story about
the abuse of power including in
potential disinformation from the
Pentagon just as much as it is this
large this other question of what
exactly are people seeing in UAPs?
Now, Michael, this is clearly all
rubbish because the Pentagon has assured
us as recently as May this year that
there is no evidence that any nonhuman,
alien, or extraterrestrial intelligence
has visited Earth. And that's a formal
finding by the ARO office, the all
domain anomaly resolution office, which
is the Pentagon's UFO investigation
office. Um, it assessed the that the
quote inaccurate claim that the US
government is reverse engineering
extraterrestrial technology and in and
is hiding it from Congress is in large
part the result of circular reporting
from a group of individuals who believe
this to be the case despite the lack of
any evidence. So where's your evidence?
Yeah. And I think it's important for
readers or listeners to know that the uh
all anomaly
uh um res or is sorry the all domain
anomaly resolution
>> it's a stupid name. Let's just be honest
about it Michael. It's a stupid bloody
name. This is the this was created by
Congress, particularly Senators uh
Gillibrand and Senator Rubio to get to
the bottom of the phenomenon and and
find out what the defense department
knows. They put out that report which
you quoted from that is a very thin
report. I mean, anybody who is familiar
with the uh case studies on UAP
sightings over the last particularly
since World War II, but over time knows
that that is a very thin report. It's a
dismissive report. It doesn't seriously
deal with many cases. Um, I think that
there is the potential for a significant
amount of circular reporting. As a
journalist, you're always worried about
that. This new whistleblower is not part
of that circular reporting. I'm
confident of that. Uh they also these
this person does not know did not know
the other individuals who verified the
name of this program. So I do believe
this and I have checked the credentials
of this whistleblower. They are who they
say they are and so it is not part of
that. it does not fit the theory of
social contagion. I think the other
thing Sorry, go ahead.
>> No, so I I just wanted to double check.
Let's talk first about what you can tell
me about the credentials of your
whistleblower without compromising any
of your sources. So clearly you have
somebody in Congress who has briefed you
on the contents of this whistleblower
report and they've told you who this
whistleblower is. Uh, have you been able
to speak to that whistleblower yourself?
>> Yes, I am in direct contact with the
whistleblower. I have verified uh I've
interviewed the person several times. I
have verified their credentials and who
they are. Um, either in government or as
a government contractor. I'm not going
to say which just to keep the universe
of potential positions large as I'm also
not revealing their gender or anything
else about them to protect them. I I
think you know and your viewers may know
witnesses and whistleblowers on this
topic like other topics but on this
topic they're very scared and their fear
is very palpable. I don't think that
they're faking it or that they're lying
about their fear. I'm also comfortable
saying that this person discovered this
material uh accidentally. This was not
something that they had expected to
encounter. They encountered a large body
of information that they describe as a
database of this information that's
available to others in the intelligence
community in the defense community. So
there are, you know, other we've heard
about that this these databases must
exist. But the allegation here is that
there is a significant body of evidence
that has not been made available to
Congress in violation of the
Constitution. A significant body of
evidence that was not included in that
Arrow report to the public and to
Congress. And so that's a serious
allegation in and of itself. So I think
before we get to what is the phenomenon
and that's a very important
conversation. Uh this is a sto in some
ways this is a process story it's an
abuse of power story and it's pointing
to the inadequacy of whistleblower
protections
large at large in the US government.
That's also something verified to me by
people uh in Congress uh either as
members or as staffers who say that they
understand why whistleblowers don't feel
comfortable because they don't have the
protections they need in order to come
forward. So I think the the burden is on
Congress to protect these brave
individuals who are understandably
scared to go public because they have
had their security clearances, their
professions and in some cases according
to some people their lives threatened.
>> Now Michael, when I did the introduction
to you earlier, I very specifically used
a section of your first article from
September 2023
where you named Stephanie O. Sullivan, a
former associate deputy director of the
CIA and principal deputy director of
national intelligence in the office of
the director of national intelligence.
And you stated that she was aware of a
UAP crash retrieval and reverse
engineering program, but that she had
denied its existence to Senator Marco
Rubio. Now I
>> which is illegal which is illegal. I I
want to focus on that for a moment
because of something I know that I'm not
going to discuss in detail here. You've
had no reason, have you, to doubt the
accuracy of that assertion at all.
>> None.
>> The allegation on its face is that an
officer of the US government has lied
criminally to a senator of the United
States.
>> Yes. A very serious accusation. You
know, the thing I find incredible is you
made that allegation back in September
last year, like a year ago,
>> and absolutely nothing has happened as a
result of it. It's the I I guess what I
find depressing is the lack of interest
from Congress, at least publicly. You
know, we get the odd quotes from um
Ascapole Matt Lazlo as he doors stops
politicians and they say, you know,
we've got UFO hearings coming and you
know, obviously we're keen to get to the
bottom of this, but where is the vigor?
Where is the understanding of the degree
of criminality that you talked about in
your original article and you're now
talking about in this new article?
Because what we are talking about here
is a constitutional travesty. It's a
breach of, as you say, article one of
the United States Constitution.
That's right, Ross. And I, you know, I
should say for viewers who don't know,
um, my bread and butter has been on
covering abuses of power. We've covered
abuses of power, including the
weaponization and politicization of the
FBI, the CIA, the Department of Homeland
Security, on free speech issues, but
also on retaliations against
whistleblowers. This is absolutely a
nonpartisan issue. It doesn't matter
your politics. You do not want the aent
the the investigative security police
functions of your government being
weaponized uh for private interests or
political interests. That's a very very
dangerous moment. That's how you get to
totalitarianism. So for me this is fun.
This is first and foremost a story about
abuses of power. You might think that
that what people are seeing these UAPs
are are just new military craft and it
should be kept secret from the American
people. That's fine if you think that.
Um but they still are required by the
Constitution to inform members of
Congress about those programs. I note in
my article that uh yes for super secret
programs you don't notify every member
of Congress but there is something
called the gang of eight which are the
uh committee chairman and the ranking
minority leader on the house and senate
uh defense and intelligence committees.
uh they are absolutely a requirement to
tell them both about unacnowledged
special access programs of which
Immaculate Constellation is allegedly
one as well as to notify them of CIA
covert operations and other intelligence
community operations including
potentially the retrieval or reverse
engineering of exotic craft to use the
jargon in congressional legislation But
look, the bottom line here is that
Congress needs to show some backbone.
The inspector general of the
intelligence community said that
whistleblower David Grush's testimony
was both urgent and credible. In July of
2022, well, it's over two and a half.
It's two two over two years ago. Uh Gush
has testified in front of Congress.
What's happening? I I think that
ultimately it's up to, you know,
journalists like you and me and these
brave whistleblowers to to and the
public to demand that Congress act and
do its job and demand transparency and
accountability by the intelligence
community that from various on various
issues, not just UAPs, is uh is out of
control as as outside of of
congressional supervision. So your
understanding from your source is that
Immaculate Constellation is the code
name for this unacnowledged
special access program, the USAP. Now,
let's get into the nerdy talk about what
security classifications mean. There's
special access programs, which are
secrets that are protected, top secret
clearance secrets. Then you've got
unacnowledged special access programs.
And then you have another category of
waved unagnowledged special access
programs, WOAPS. And in the case of
Wooaps, there is, I understand, a very
clear exemption for good reasons for
national security reasons to protect
highly classified programs. These WOsPs
are only briefed, I think, orally, to
members of the gang of eight. But the
unacnowledged special access programs,
USAPS, which is what you say Immaculate
Constellation is, there is no reason at
all why that could not be disclosed
inside a skiff to the Senate Select
Committee for Intelligence, the uh Armed
Services Committee, all of those
oversight committees that are part of
the constitutional requirements for
accountability and transparency. Am I
correct?
>> Yeah, that's right. There was no mention
by uh the new whistleblower or the
people that confirmed the existence of
Immaculate Constellation that it was a
woo. It was simply an uh unagnowledged
special a access uh program and so it
should have been absolutely brief to the
gang of eight. I will say that uh one of
the individuals who confirmed the
existence of the special access program
told me that simply publishing the name
unacnowledge uh the name immaculate
constellation would trigger uh
surveillance of me that it is it is
located is kept under very tight secrecy
in the office of the secretary of
defense. Uh, obviously that is a little
nerve-wracking. I will say I gave the
Pentagon I I I I emailed the Pentagon
with a very uh detailed description of
my article last Friday. They asked in
the morning. They asked uh for more
time. I gave them until Monday. Uh
Monday they said they needed until the
end of the day Monday. I had not heard
from them at the end of the day Monday.
So they had um almost five days uh to
get back to me and uh you and I are
recording this on Monday evening. So if
there is an update to this hopefully
you'll mention that to the viewers but I
have not heard from the Pentagon if you
know which you can interpret however you
like. Uh but uh you know I think the
bottom line is still the same here. If
you believe in democracy, which is rule
by the people rather than rule by secret
police, intelligence and security
forces, this is information that
absolutely needs to be briefed by the
DoD andor the IC to that gang of eight
or to a broader committee of Congress.
>> Now, Michael, I can tell you there's a
lot in your article that doesn't come as
a surprise to me. I just haven't been
able to corroborate with my sources what
you've been able to find out about
certain code names and what you know
about the contents of that program. But
what I can tell you is the reference
made by your source to the fact that
there is a database that's been kept
separate which was discovered. I am told
that what the Admiral Tom Wilson memo
written by Dr. Eric Davis says is
correct. that inside the office of the
under secretary for defense
intelligence, there was and I'm told
still is a completely separate database
that you would understand and your
source would understand goes by the name
Immaculate Constellation. And it's
interesting to hear from you so many
years later that that what Admiral
Thomas Wilson stumbled across and I have
to add consistently now denies uh is now
being proven to be the case that there
was a completely separate database that
was locked off from the rest of the
defense department computer system which
would explain by the way why Edward
Snowden when he did his sole couldn't
find anything about it. There is a
completely separate database which is
kept completely airlocked from the rest
of the defense department that contains
all of this information relating to the
UAP program. So let's go through this.
I'm I'm really interested to know more.
Your understanding is that Immaculate
Constellation consists of the capability
to detect, quarantine, and transfer UAP
and alien reproduction vehicle
collection incidents before they are
observed and circulated within the
military intelligence enterprise, thus
serving as a means of enforcing internal
information security. Now, I presume UAP
is a reference to a nonhuman
craft. Correct?
If you're one of the millions of dog
owners, you're likely aware that
maintaining a healthy dog can be
complicated. Joint discomfort, bad odor,
lack of energy, smelly breath are just a
handful of the troubles a dog can
experience. But what exactly separates a
healthy dog from an unhealthy dog?
According to Dr. Marty Goldstein, one of
America's most renowned holistic
veterinarians, there is one potentially
dangerous substance that you should stop
feeding your dog immediately. If your
dog has been feeling tired or not having
the energy it used to, this one compound
could be the reason.
Many dog food manufacturers have this
substance in their dog foods, and it's
one that most dogs consume on a daily
basis. This is something that's not
being reported by most mainstream media
and big dog food manufacturers.
After years of research, Dr. Marty has
decided to release an informative video
to the public free and uninter
uninterrupted showcasing exactly which
foods you should stop feeding your dog
which you can find out right now by
going to healthydog1.com/
ross or by clicking the link in the
description box below. That's
healthydogthenumber
one.com/ros.
That's all one word.

Just by making this one simple change,
he was able to support his dog's overall
health. You can also do the same thing
right in your own home and it takes just
a few minutes a day. So, go find that
video now at healthydog1.com/ros
or click on the link below to find out
right now. You won't believe how simple
this is.
Now, I presume UAP is a reference to a
nonhuman
craft. Correct?
>> Well, I don't know. Um, honestly, and I
mean I laugh a little bit because it's I
I you always are you always have a lot
of information when you're writing an
article and you're trying to figure out
what to keep in and keep out. And I I
did keep that information in there
because that was the information uh that
the whistleblower has in their report uh
alien reproduction vehicle. I I don't
think I've ever I'm not sure I've I'd
used that term before. It's obviously
going to raise a lot of eyebrows and I
should stress that I'm not saying I know
that they exist or that I'm endorsing
any other part of the things that have
been said about that. But indeed that is
what this person has put in their report
to members of Congress notifying them
about this database which also Ross I
wanted to mention because earlier I
mentioned that there's a significant
amount of visual data. However, the uh
whistleblower in their report says that
they also includes human intelligence.
And so, you're also looking at reports.
There's one spectacular incident
described in the report. I mean, there's
several in the report. One of them is of
an F-22 being uh surrounded by UAPs
shaped like orbs. and effectively
escorted
uh escorted makes it sound like uh nice
but sort of forcibly moved out of its
mission area by these UAPs. So a real
direct engagement by UAPs. Um I don't
know. Uh and and the whistleblower is
not saying what those UAPs are. the
person's not saying that they're, you
know, nonhuman or extraterrestrial.
Uh, obviously, if they're Chinese or
Russian or Iranian or something, that's
a technology that, uh, is not out there.
Uh, and should be very alarming for
straight defense reasons. Uh but yeah,
then the introduction of this term alien
reproduction vehicle is effectively a
reference to craft that are using uh uh
not using typical propulsion and using
something that is more akin to what
people call anti-gravity.
>> So that's the interesting thing. There's
two nomatures that we need to define in
what your whistleblowers told you goes
into his report. There's UAP and that's
gray. We just don't know at this moment.
But alien reproduction vehicle, I can
tell you, is very, very clearly a
reference to a vehicle that has been
constructed from nonhuman technology
that is being operated presumably by
either private aerospace or the United
States government.
>> Yeah, that's that's right. And it's an
interesting the language is very
important because if you read what Arrow
wrote, there is potentially room within
that report for them to be able to
u they say we haven't found any evidence
of vehicles from extraterrestrials or
from other planets. Uh but they do seem
to leave open the door potentially to
this different category of craft. And so
that is one potential is that uh I mean
for me I as an fairly newcomer to this
issue I was not familiar at all with
this discourse but basically there is
this idea and it is in the whistleblower
report that the United States government
is in possession of of craft that it has
itself made based on uh UAPs that it has
captured and apparently using
anti-gravity as the means for for prop
for propulsion.
>> Now, you mentioned, Michael, that
there's a significant volume of
intelligence reports in this uh database
that the whistleblower describes
documenting firthand encountered
encounters with UAPs or UFOs by defense
personnel and that this exists within
databases accessible to the intelligence
community. Um there's highquality
imagery imment and measurement and
signature intelligence mass of UAPs. And
the sources of this intelligence are a
blend of directed and incidental
collection capabilities positioned in
low Earth orbit, the upper atmosphere,
as well as military and civilian
aviation altitudes and maritime
environments. I've got to ask, Michael,
did your source show you any of this
imagery?
>> No, I did not see any of them. I would
have loved to, but I think uh it's fair
to say this person felt that that would
be just a severe risk. I mean, that's
the kind of thing that this person felt
could
and they could end up in prison
essentially if they had attempted to uh
capture any of that imagery. I did also
though want to say Ross because I didn't
mention it earlier and we haven't talked
about it. It's important to point out
that and you just sort of said it the
these are images and other data
collected by uh sensors that are
operated by the US military and by the
intelligence community and potentially
others. Uh, but this is not this is not
just photos and videos shot by civilians
or even commercial airline pilots with
their cell phones or even uh
sophisticated cameras. This is shot by
US government. Much of this material is
captured by US government personnel. And
so the language that they use in the
report is that there's a clear chain of
custody on these on this evidence. And
so in other words, you know, for people
that that pay attention to the popular
discussion of UAPs, there's a lot of
videos out there and often we don't know
where they who shot them or where they
came from or it's not a clear chain of
custody. That's the gold standard as any
investigators. You want to know exactly
who shot it, you know, who's had custody
of it. That's the whole chain of custody
so that if anybody wants to do further
investigations, you can go interview the
crew. So, of course, the one of the most
famous examples is the famous tik tok
tic tac uh sighting where you have four
Navy pilots who are all incredibly
credible Navy pilots who uh tell the
exact same story about what happened
when they encountered this UAP. And so,
that's the level of quality that you're
talking about and and and a lot of it,
not a little bit of it. And we have
heard we've heard in the past deputy
assistant former deputy assistant
secretary uh of defense Christopher
Melon has said um that there is a
significant body of that information.
We've also heard Lu Alzando and David
Grush say that. Um, but this is the
first time to my knowledge that anybody
has actually named uh this uh
unacknowledged special access program
and described in some detail both the
kinds of uh evidence gathered as well as
uh the shapes of the UAPs. And I should
just say that this report I hope at some
point it does become public. Um, it's a
fascinating there's much more in it that
I could than I could summarize in the
article, but there's just a fascinating
description of of different UAPs that
that we've all heard about orbs and tic
tac and discs and triangles and
boomerangs and all the different, you
know, you think about the Phoenix
Lights. And so you sort of if you have
some familiarity with the big UAP cases,
it's very striking to see that there is
a database of UAPs captured apparently
by the defense department and the
intelligence community in a database
that Congress at a minimum the gang of
eight should have access to.
>> So let's go through the detail that you
were given. I'm intrigued to hear that
you heard a lot more detail than you
were able to put into your article. But
as I understand it, the report that has
been given to Congress by the
whistleblower describes in detail
various UAPs and how from 1991 to 2022,
the most common UAP shapes reported in
this data set were spheres, orbs, discs,
sauces, ovals, tic tacs, triangles,
boomerang arrow heads, and irregular um
organic shapes. Mhm.
>> Um,
>> your source obviously had an opportunity
to look at that database. Can you give
me some information on the the size of
the whistleblower report? How many pages
is it? How much detail is being provided
to Congress?
>> Yeah, the report. So, I have the report.
It's uh I think it's 25 pages. It's um
very well written. This is a
professional uh somebody whose job it is
to interpret information and evidence.
Uh somebody who obviously feels a moral
duty to the constitution. Um uh
similarly to David Grush uh this is a
person who obviously loves their country
uh and is patriotic and
did not feel does not feel that this
information if it got out would
undermine national security. Um I I hope
very much that the report that some
version of it can be made public because
this is taxpayers paid for this research
as you mentioned over many decades. Um I
am not sure that people maybe maybe
people really know what's what it is. Um
maybe they don't. But either way uh
there's no I I don't see any reason I
never I didn't see anything in it. And
I'm not a journalist like, and with all
due respect to Julian Assange,
um I would not just release information
willy-nilly, I also care about the
security of the United States, as does
this person. That's why I gave the
Defense Department almost five days to
get back to me. Um but you know, it it
has an incredible amount of information
and I think there's just been a lot of
gaslighting on this issue. And one of
the things I describe in here, and your
viewers probably know this history
better than I do, but basically the CIA
created something called the Robertson
panel in 1953,
which came out and said that all of
these reports should be aggressively,
not only aggressively debunked, reports
of UAPs, um, but ridiculed, you know,
and ridicule is a very, uh, severe form
of disinformation because it really
attacks the character of a person. It's
a way of calling people uh mentally ill.
I think it's very cruel and um and so I
think that this report, you know,
validates that people were not crazy
that reported these things. Uh that
these these things are real uh physical
uh manifestations, objects, phenomena.
Uh that these incidents are real, that
they've been viewed by uh many enlisted
soldiers. that a campaign of of
repression and threats and fear has been
waged against people and then the
gaslighting which is also you know it's
a tactic of of abusers
continued from the Robertson panel in
1953 and then and then you may and then
of course your viewers probably also
know there's something called the Condan
uh committee in 196 I think it ran from
66 to 68 which also dismissed all of
this and so I'm also somebody that is
very concerned about government
disinformation and there is are multiple
cases of of acknowledged and proven
disinformation including by the Air
Force uh office of special intelligence
and so we don't want the government you
don't want the government hiding things
that are in the public's interest to
know and you also don't want the
government uh spreading disinformation
uh and and ruining people's lives
because these are real people's lives
we're talking about here and there's no
so far no justification has been given
for this level of of secrecy uh
censorship and disinformation.
>> Let's get into the nitty-gritty some of
the detail that you do reveal in your
report. And there is, as you've already
acknowledged a little bit earlier, an
absolutely incredible incident involving
an F-22 Raptor, which is the top
frontline fighter jet in the United
States military arsenal. and it
describes orbs surrounding and forcing
an F-22 out of a patrol area. The F-22
broke trajectory and attempted to evade
but was intercepted and boxed in by
approximately three to six UAPs. Now,
the thing about that, Michael, is I
often cop it from some viewers who are
very much of the rosy view about
non-human intelligence that they're all
benevolent and kind. What you seem to be
describing here is something where at
the very least a UAP or a group of UAPs
are essentially trying to behave like an
adversary. They're boxing in a fighter
jet. What's going on? What does the um
whistleblower think about that finding
and what conclusion did you reach on the
basis of the evidence that you read in
the report?
>> Yeah, I mean the the first thing I mean
so again I I want to stress I'm new to
this. I have uh you know beginner mind
on this issue. I mean it's it's I am not
by any means an expert on it or a
military expert. So with those caveats
out of the way, I mean the first most
obvious thing you're struck by with that
particular case is that this technology
or form of life or whatever it is
adversary is demonstrating dominance. I
mean that just the most simple
the most simple basic thing is that
there's somebody in in if there's an
interaction
uh you know it can be cooperative or
among equals or it can be hierarchical
and there's dominance by a by a greater
power and in this case that those craft
or phenomena whatever are demonstrating
dominance and that does have to do with
that tick- tock incident that uh the
Navy pilots describe. I mean, um, I
think you could argue that it wasn't,
um, not necessarily, we don't know if
it's say hostile. In other words, nobody
was shot down and there's no evidence
that anybody was harmed, but dominance
is about power and about a demonstration
of capabilities. And so clearly in that
case, and there are other cases in that
in that report, which again I hope is
made public, um, yeah, these are
phenomenon showing dominance. It's not
showing uh you know benevolent space
brotherhood. It's it's demonstrating
dominance at a just at a very basic
physical level. You don't need to do a
lot of interpretation to see that that's
what's going on. So in the in the report
you actually describe how one UAP
maneuvered very close to the jet to the
starboard of the cockpit and it
established a rigid spatial relationship
with the F-22 so that when the jet was
rolling and diving and trying to get
away from this object, it stayed fixed.
That's what I find fascinating. Whatever
the technology is behind these objects,
what they were able to do was track
exactly what the F-22 was doing. It
couldn't shake it.
>> Amazing. I mean, it's I mean, one I
think Yeah. Anybody that knows some of
the history of this, it sounds a lot
like Foo Fighters, you know, from World
War II. These similar orbs. I mean, orbs
are very a common UAP. But yeah um not
uh because I think an important piece of
context is that and I I describe in in
my article I give a lot of space and
explain the conventional explanations of
this. How might a UAP debunker how would
they describe this? One of the ideas is
that this is sort of a natural
phenomenon. This is maybe a new plasma
or a kind of ball lightning.
um doesn't seem to be that in the it
doesn't it would be an extraordinary
because it's moving clearly with the jet
and so
>> so does it acknowledge that the jet I
mean a lot of these pilots in the F-22
have got phased array radar systems
which are incredibly top-of-the-line
radar um is there any acknowledgement to
your knowledge in the report as to
whether any of these objects were picked
up on radar
>> I uh that's a good question on that
specific case. I'm not sure. But I'm
glad you mentioned that because that
yes, there is a significant discussion
of tracking these objects on radar and
so radar is a big part of the evidence
base. The report also mentions that uh
that they are uh documenting both the
UAPs and the effects of UAPs through
sensors tracking their physical effects
on on the Earth environment. um that are
maybe not visible or they say are not
visible. So So what's being emp
>> I'm sorry. Go ahead.
>> What does that mean? I'm What do you
mean their physical effects on the Earth
environment?
>> Um I I can't remember if there was
anything more specific about it, but it
was uh I think the language was
atmospheric effects of these UAP and I I
don't remember any more detail than
that. One of the things you do mention,
there's another incident that you talk
about where an orange orb was watched
from the by the crew of a Navy aircraft
carrier. A sphere descended from high
altitude to about 100 to 200 yards
directly above the flight deck of this
aircraft carrier. It emitted a soft
orange red light which didn't illuminate
the ocean or the flight deck despite the
appearance of intense luminosity. Um,
the surface of the UAP was observed to
be dynamic, roing like the surface of
the sun. And it was this bit here in
your article that intrigued me. It
appears to be acknowledging biological
effects on humans, the consciousness,
psychical engagement by these objects
with human observers. It said
afterwards, observing personnel felt as
if they snapped out of a trance and a
sense of personal unease. That's a
really interesting biological effect of
this phenomena, isn't it?
>> Yeah. And very impressive that it's uh
acknowledged by the military. I mean I
think as you know this phenomenon has a
physical nuts and bolts hardware part of
it which is the level at which I think
most I mean which many people are
uncomfortable even talking about but
certainly it's probably less
uncomfortable than some of the
psychological or you might even say
spiritual effects that people describe
relating to the phenomenon. So I was
impressed to see that that had been
properly documented by uh whoever it was
in the US military that had done the
interviews with the crew to describe
these hypnotic effects because you know
it's clearly been part of the of the of
the history of the research of UAPs and
their effects on people is that people
describe having lingering effects both
uh you know bad and good uh you know at
a you know certainly a sense of awe,
which may just be awe, you know, some
more powerful technology than we have.
Uh, but also something that's sort of
uncanny and doesn't lend itself as
easily to language that these,
you know, uh, soldiers on a aircraft
carrier were apparently describing to
some investigator.
So Michael, the big question is, is
there any basis that your whistleblower
understands this could possibly be
legal? I mean, one of the most commonly
speculated explanations is that perhaps
as early as back in the days of Truman,
Harry Truman and Eisenhower, there was
some kind of presidential executive
order that was made that enshrined this
legacy program in secrecy and somehow
removed it from the need to put it under
congressional oversight. To your
understanding, as somebody who
understands a lot of the constitutional
law of America, I I can't think of any
basis upon which the American
Constitution could be superseded by
presidential order. Can you?
>> No. Because it's it's right there in
black and white in our Constitution and
it's article one, you know, it's like
the first amendment. It's like they put
it first for a reason. This is it's at
the heart of our system of checks and
balances. It's um you know I mean as you
get older as I get older I really
appreciate the brilliance and the genius
of the US Constitution and this idea of
of overlapping powers and checks and
balances. And so I think that this is
more evidence that the system is out of
balance, that the executive branch uh
that that elements within the executive
branch, elements within the defense and
intelligence communities are outside of
democratic civilian control. And I for
one don't want to live in a country that
is not under civilian democratic
control. We don't want to live as slaves
or as surfs. That's the whole purpose of
the United States of America. So, I
can't imagine any court, much less the
US Supreme Court, upholding the right of
the Defense Department or the
intelligence community to withhold this
information
at a minimum from the gang of eight. And
I'm not entirely comfortable with just
eight members of Congress. It's that's
not that's not language from the
Constitution. And that's a more recent
interpretation. But I think more broadly
on this issue, and I say this to my
friends who are, you know, very very
skeptical, like really don't believe any
of this, and who think it's either some
combination of
hallucinations,
disinformation, and social contagion. I
always say, great. If you think that,
then you should be the biggest advocate
for disclosure and transparency and
accountability because if this is some
new, you know, if it's a foreign if it's
if the Chinese or the Russians or
Iranians or some foreign adversary or if
it's the US government, article one of
the constitution still applies and the
Supreme Court would would require its
enforcement if it ever came to them.
Now, Michael, you've had the chance to
talk directly with this whistleblower.
And I have to say for me, a lot of the
time when I've met people from the
legacy UAP program, that the decisive
moment where I became to believe that
this is real is when I actually got the
chance to meet these people, look them
in the eye, and make the judgment that
yeah, they were telling the truth. I
couldn't trip them up. You've had that
opportunity with your own whistleblower.
this person who's written this
whistleblower report to Congress. What's
your gut feeling about the truth of the
allegations that there is nonhuman
technology being held by the US
government andor private aerospace
without congressional oversight or
transparency?
>> Yeah. I mean, so first of all, this I
should say, you know, we've I've dealt
with a lot of whistleblowers over the
last couple of years. We had uh two
incredible sources
uh tell us who the first people to get
COVID were at the Wuhan Institute of
Viology. And those people were scared,
but they felt the public needed to know.
And by the way, Wall Street Journal
confirmed our reporting one week later.
Um these whistleblowers are absolutely
are terrified. They're they're really
really scared things. They they've they
have reason to be scared. I think they
are psychologically healthy individuals.
I don't think they have there's nothing
I could I I've you know my in my past
work I've dealt with mental illness. I
interview homeless people on the street
who are psychotic, including having UFO
and alien psychosis. I I recognize that
that could be psychosis. That's these
people are not in psychotic states.
These these people are mentally healthy.
They've passed all sorts of tests to be
where they are. I have another
whistleblower. I can't say a single
thing about this person other than
they're totally terrified. And I've been
encouraging them to go to Congress, to
go public, that they'll be safer that
way. But it's very hard to fake that
kind of fear. You know, most people are
not very good actors. I mean, most
actors are not very good actors. Um,
it's very hard to fake that level of
fear, especially when you're dealing
with people, you know, who they are and
where they sit in various agencies or
contractors
and and they're in a position to know.
And and this and this person, I will
say, I have met them in person. The
whole way in which we met showed deep
alarm and concern about their safety and
uh they are still very nervous about
this and feel that you know the their
obligation to the public interest you
know um trumps their fear because of
course courage is not acting without
fear courage is is acting despite having
a lot of fear and so I think these
people deserve a lot of credit they're
really American heroes as far as I'm
concerned So, I want to pin you down,
Michael. Where do you stand? You've got
a gut instinct. What's your gut telling
you about the veracity of the person
you've been speaking to?
>> I'm sure I I'm very confident they're
telling the truth. I I I mean, I don't
I'm never You never want to be 100%, but
I'd say 95%
uh that they're telling the truth. Um
same for the existence of this database
um and this program. It's a, you know,
it's a very specific
set of details. I don't think that it it
doesn't come from the lore. It's new.
Um, I did verify this all always you
can't do anything with you should never
do anything with a single source in my
view. I do have other sources that
confirmed that name. And like I said,
the confirmation came with a warning
that it could result in my surveillance.
So, um, I think it's a strong story.
Sure. I will also point out, Ross, you
know, uh I've I I wrote I wrote, I
think, three pieces last year on UAPs,
uh out of probably 300 articles. A lot
of people wanted me to keep doing UAP
stories. And what I said was, I'll do a
a story when I have something really
significant that I'm willing to, you
know, put my name on and stand by. And
so, this is the first story in over a
year, and stand by the story. And I
stand by the sources. I I believe that
they're telling the truth.
>> Why do you believe what does your source
tell you? What are your sources telling
you about why the cover up? I mean, I I
lie in bed at night and think, why don't
the US government just come out? Why
doesn't Joe Biden just walk to lectern
in the White House and say, "Ladies and
gentlemen, people of America, people of
the world, we are not alone." Why the
lie?
>> Well, yeah. Not only that, but it's also
like why the persistence of the lie over
such a long period of time. I mean, if
you believe, if I believe my sources,
and I suspect your sources have told you
the same thing, there was every
expectation that if Hillary Clinton had
been elected, um, because she was very
close to John Podesta, who's somebody
that um, I've known for a long time, we
don't always agree. On many issues, we
don't agree. Um, that's why I like the
this issue is one of the pleasant things
about it is that it's very bipartisan
and non ideological, but there was some
sense in which the Clintons were going
to do something. There's also I mean
you've seen Donald Trump has said I mean
I think for anybody who thinks I mean
the most basic allegation here the most
fun allegation is that the US government
knows more than they're telling the
public or Congress President Trump has
just confirmed that multiple times in
recent podcasts in recent days saying
that he knows things that are not
public. So President Trump was briefed.
Why didn't he make it public? Why have
Biden and Harris not made it public?
John Podesta was in the White House for
a different issue, but certainly for no
lack of influence.
You know, everybody has the same set of
reasons. Um there's some sense in which
there's just fear of public panic and I
think there's some reason to worry about
that. I also think it can be overstated.
I think that there's some genuine
concern that that um that these that
these technologies are an advantage to
the United States against our earthly
adversaries. That's uh I find that uh
plausible. And then I think the other
more troubling
uh
you know uh conclusion would be that
there's some bad things that have been
going on as part of this
I'll I'll use the word cover up, you
know, because that's what it is. There's
some troubling behaviors that have gone
along with a cover up. I mean, David
Grush is on the record saying that
people have been killed. Um I don't have
evidence of that. I'm not that's not my
claim. I'm saying that's what he said.
I've I've certainly seen other people
say it. I did do a whole story last year
on uh on UAP witnesses and
whistleblowers reporting threats,
including death threats, not just in the
United States, but around the world. I
find those witnesses credible. I don't
think that you allege that the
government I don't think that sane
people alleged that the US government or
government officials had threatened them
um unless it had occurred. So, I worry
that there has been some bad behaviors
that have gone along with a cover up and
that the various folks that are still in
what is sometimes referred to as the
legacy program or these unagnowledged
special access programs that they're
worried about some consequence for
themselves. I mean, look, they didn't
release all the JFK files and Mike
Pompeo, Trump's former CIA, the CIA
director under Trump said that it's
because there were people still alive
who were involved. Well, I mean, I don't
find that particularly persuasive and
maybe we need some agreement on amnesty.
Um, but that also seems very plausible
because I I we certainly have seen in
other cases how bad
>> how bad powerful bureaucrats can behave
when they get into those positions.
>> It's funny. I once flippantly wrote, I
think it was in my book, Michael, in
plain sight. I wrote about how, you
know, the lying bastards that are
responsible for this cover up should be
tred and feathered and dragged around
Washington behind the back of a Humvey.
And some idiot tried to suggest I was
advocating violence against the
gatekeepers. In fact, what I strongly
believe is that there should be a truth
and reconciliation commission. I I was I
was privileged to be able to cover the
South African post-apartite regime
hearings
>> as a journalist and I thought it was
incredible to watch boss secret service
killers who'd murdered people in the um
freedom movement uh apologizing and
admitting their crimes to the families
of the people who'd been killed. And it
was an incredibly therapeutic moment and
it has stopped I think it stopped South
Africa from falling apart into civil
war. And I can tell you I know the
allegations of people being killed are
true because I've been doing my own
investigations which people may soon s
soon see the result of. Um there are
very very grave illegalities and
criminal actions and morally
reprehensible actions, actions that go
to the whole issue of questioning our
humanity as a species behind why there's
the cover up. And I just want to come
back. There was a great quote from
Matthew Pines, a mutual friend, a former
very senior intelligence analyst in one
of your original stories from September
last year. Matthew said to you, "There
may be an acute concern that if this
becomes another church committee level
scandal, it would pour kerosene over the
burning embers of distrust in the
political system." And whether it's the
worry over technological surprise from
strategic competitors like China or that
too many people have already spilled the
beans, the political leadership may feel
they have to manage things as much as
possible behind the scenes as they face
an unstable geopolitical dynamic and
gird for an exceptionally fraugh 2024
campaign. That that that comment that
quote by Matthew Pines I thought was
very precient because he's been proved
right. It has been an incredibly rocky
campaign. But do you think any of that
is an excuse for non-disclosure,
non-transparency, nonaccountability to
the American public and the rest of the
world about what America really knows?
>> No, absolutely not. And I come back to
for me this is an abusive power story
first and foremost. And and I by the way
I 100% agree with you. Uh it's more
important to get the truth out and to
end this decadesl long government
disinformation
uh ridicule character assassination
uh cover up because it's really causing
harm to real people and it's undermining
public trust in the government. I'm not
um I'm not anti-government. Like I I was
actually I object to false accusations
against the FBI which are which happened
by some individuals on social media
alleging things that are exaggerations
or not true. Uh I think it undermines
and waters down the when you have
serious abuses of power that you need to
get to the bottom of. We're overdue for
another church committee hearing. I
mean, that's the famous 1975
postwatergate moment where we learned
about MK Ultra. We learned about
assassinations. We learned about uh, you
know, efforts at mind control, things
that sound like science fiction. We
learned were actually being done by the
CIA. I think we're overdue for a period
of reform. I mean, America's founders
when they said, you know, you need a
revolution every few decades, that's
really what they meant is they meant
that you need a reform. You need a
cleaning of the house, you know, a
cleaning out of the closets. And so,
yeah, absolutely. And I don't think it's
it should not be about revenge. It
should be about truth and
reconciliation, just like the South
African model showed. and let's extend
it to the JFK files and the UAP files
and the and other abuses of power that
we've seen because ultimately that's a
concern for all citizens, not just uh
for people that are concerned about this
particular issue.
>> Well, Michael Schillburgger, where can
people read your article, which is, by
the way, a fantastic read.
>> Thank you so much. Uh, yeah, people can
just go to public.news, news, which is
our Substack, but also the same content
is available um on X, formerly Twitter,
Shelonburgger is the handle, no C, just
Shelonburgger.
>> And Michael, can I ask you this? Um is
your whistleblower has have they given
evidence in camera or any testimony at
all apart from their report to Congress?
Have they been called to give evidence
under oath?
I don't I genuinely don't know the
answer to that question, but I can say
that they have talked to either members
of Congress or their staffs and there
there are efforts underway. And I also
should say that
uh
members of Congress and their staffs
really would love to hear from other
whistleblowers
and if they're scared. I also want to
say um I can work with them to protect
their confidentiality. I think the
reason that whistleblowers talk to us is
because we are extremely careful about
protecting our sources. And I also know
the congressional staffers who are also
serious professionals at protecting
people. And so you'll be safer if you
come forward and have contact with a
journalist like myself and trusted
congressional staffers than if you're
out there on your own. So a message to
anybody out there that's thinking about
coming forward.
>> Um I'm really sorry to keep on going uh
as long as I am, but I'm really
fascinated to get as much detail from
you as possible. Clearly this has gone
to a committee before the Congress. Are
you able to say which committee it's
gone to?
Um, I'm not comfortable saying, but
anybody that knows how this stuff works
will be able to guess.
>> Yeah. I mean, I'm guessing the Senate
Select Committee for Intelligence, but
um, uh, moving on from that, um, one one
thing I'm I'm really worried about is
there's been a lot of evidence. You're
quite right, by the way, that last year
you said that 30 people had given
evidence, and it's actually a bit more
than that now. Um, but one of the things
that's been worrying me is a lot of this
evidence has been given in camera before
staffers and legal counsel because one
of the methods that politicians use to
essentially immune themselves from being
too close to sensitive revelations is to
send senior staffers who are legal
counsel. So my understanding is a lot of
the testimony has been given in camera
before legal council and senior staffers
on these committees like oversight
committees like the intelligence
committee and the um uh armed services
committee and the oversight committee.
Have any politicians to your knowledge
directly engaged with your
whistleblower? And if so why not?
I genuinely don't know the answer to
that question, but I did want to say
because we haven't said this before is
that I don't trust Arrow at all and I
don't I would never I would actually
actively recommend uh whistleblowers not
talk to Arrow. I don't think that
they're trustworthy. I'm sorry to say. I
also don't trust the ICG or the DoD IG
um anymore. I just don't think that the
um that I don't think they're doing
their jobs and we haven't like there's
what's what's going on with these all
these people that have come forward. I
think all the action is at the level of
Congress and the public as mediated by
journalists and the media. And so if I
were a whistleblower and I were scared,
that's the two I would find a
journalist. Doesn't have to be me. happy
to work with anybody, but a journalist
you trust and I'm also happy to connect
people to those congressional staffers,
but that's that's where this has to take
place. We have to strengthen protections
for whistleblowers. I mean, I appreciate
if you're a the head of a big
bureaucracy, you don't want your
disgruntled staff running off to to be
whistleblowers all the time. On the
other hand, if if it's if it's not a if
the issue is not a big one, then it's
not going to matter for you anyway. But
we don't have adequate whistleblower
protections. I mean, for me, that's like
a whole separate problem and story. We
need to strengthen whistleblower
protections. That's Congress's job. It
needs to do that. It should be one of
the highest priorities for anybody who
cares about good government. Certainly
for anybody that cares about getting out
the truth and disclosure around UAPs
because as it is now, I just think many
people quite reasonably are just too
scared to come forward.
Well, Michael, I hope your article plays
a significant role in encouraging those
whistleblowers to come forward and
congratulations on your piece.
Immaculate Constellation is quite a
name. I wonder if it's a play on
Immaculate Conception. Maybe we'll never
know. Michael Shelonburgger, thank you
so much.
