Good day and welcome to Reality Check.
Before we start this week's show, a
little bit about this week's sponsor.
Dr. Steven Gundry is sharing his
findings about a potential toxin that's
in many of the quote healthy foods that
some scientists push us to eat. They may
actually be causing digestive issues for
millions of people worldwide. warning
signs including weight gain, fatigue,
digestive discomfort, and stiff joints,
even skin problems. And Dr. Gundry says
these signs, these side effects are
often mistaken for normal signs of
aging. You just have to know which foods
are actually healthy and which contain
this hidden potential toxin. He's put
together an informative video you can
watch at gutcleansprotocol.com/ros.
That's gutcleansprotocol.com/ros.
We're going to link to it below the
video. And again, that's

Okay, now let's get on with the show.
[Music]
Good day and welcome to this special
election edition of Reality Check. I'm
Ross Coloulart and we're in the final
days of the 2024 presidential election
campaign. And of course, the issue
everyone's thinking about, of course, is
UFOs. Or at least that's what Donald
Trump is saying. Donald Trump has been
telling people in recent interviews,
including Joe Rogan, that one of the
questions he's being asked about the
most on the campaign trail is the
mystery of UFOs, unidentified flying
objects, or as we more politely call
them these days, unidentified anomalous
phenomena, UAPs. So, I thought in the
runup of the final days of the election
campaign, it would be a good idea to
look at the two candidates and see where
they stand on UFOs, UAPs, and also to
have a look at the history of the
subject with presidential candidates and
presidents going back in the past. So,
let's start with what the official
government position is on UAPs. And the
Pentagon officially has said in March
this year, there is no evidence that the
US government or any private companies
have reversed engineered
extraterrestrial technology. Nor are
there any confirmed sightings of UAPs
having alien origin. And this all
contradicts multiple whistleblowers,
including David Grush and Lou Alzando
and Christopher Melon who've said there
is evidence being held secretly by the
government of UAPs of an NHI, a nonhuman
intelligence presence on this planet. It
all sounds like some wacky conspiracy
theory. But as I found when I went
digging back in the archives, there's
been an extraordinary amount of cander
amongst presidential candidates and
presidents and the subject of UA UAPs
doesn't deserve to have the stigma and
taboo that's attached to it. So in that
context, let's start with what I think
is probably one of the seinal moments in
politics on the subject of UFOs. So, in
2007,
NBC's Tim Russet asked a very curly
question of a Democratic presidential
candidate, Dennis Cusinich, and he was
asked, this is a Cleveland uh Democratic
representative, Dennis Cusinich, he was
asked, had he ever seen a UFO? And Tim
Russett was very well informed because
Kusenich answered honestly. And Russet
said, "Shirley Mlan, it's always
Shirley's fault. She's the one, how is
it that an actress, by the way, can ask
and admit that she knows about UFOs and
she's had encounters with UFOs and
nobody gives her that much of a hard
time, but if a presidential candidate
admits it, they get vilified." Russet
asked, "Shirley Mlan writes in her new
book that you cited a UFO over her home
in Washington State, that you found the
encounter extremely moving, that it was
a triangular craft, silent and hovering,
that you felt a connection to your heart
and heard directions in your mind."
"Now, did you see a UFO?" Russet asked
the presidential candidate. And boy did
Dennis Kusenich squirm.
After a while he answered, "Uh, I did."
And the rest of the account it was an
unidentified flying object. Okay, it's
like it's unidentified. And the rest of
his answer was quite disastrous. But I
believe
Kusenich answered honestly. But what's
interesting is what happened to Dennis
Cusenich. His political campaign was
destroyed from that moment. And from
that moment, the whole notion of a
political candidate admitting any kind
of an interest in UFOs, UAPs became
political poison. It's one of the most
iconic moments in presidential campaign
history for how to lose a presidential
election. And that's really sad because
as you'll see today, there's been quite
a lot of admissions by multiple
presidents that they have in fact
engaged with the UFO subject. And in
some cases, they've even seen UFOs. And
and as anyone with half an eye on the
subject in the last few years knows,
there's been a series of admissions
building since the 2017 New York Times
stories by Leslie Kaine and Ralph
Blumenal, which revealed the existence
of a secret UAP UFO investigation
program inside the Pentagon. And this
culminated very much in a decision in a
report made by the office of director of
national intelligence in 2021 where it
was formally admitted basically that
UAPs unidentified anomalous phenomena
are real and that they do pose a
potential flight safety risk and a
threat to national security a potential
threat to national security. It doesn't
get any more clear to that than that.
And the thing that frustrates me as a
journalist is why the rest of the
mainstream media don't wake up and
realize the significance of that ODNI
admission.
I think in the context of all of this,
we also need to acknowledge that in this
particular election campaign, there's
been a huge social media activist
movement spearheaded in part by civil
rights attorney Danny Shei and veteran
social issues campaigner Jim Garrison
through their new paradigm institute.
and they were lobbying for questions to
be asked about UFOs, UAPs in the several
presidential debates. And of course,
those questions weren't asked because of
the cow towing, lick spittling,
groveling, total toad mainstream media
types who allow themselves to be so
egregiously and shamefully manipulated
by what has been a multi-deadslong
Pentagon and intelligence
communitydriven cover up to conceal the
fact that the government knows a damn
sight more about UAPs.
non-human intelligence than it ever
cares to admit. So, what is the position
of both presidential candidates in the
run-up to this Tuesday's presidential
election? Well, let's start with Kla
Harris. President, Vice President Kala
Harris. And let's to be honest about
this say very, very quickly that her
position on UAPs is a big fat nothing.
The um the White House under Joe Biden
has of course made a number of
statements and most of the more
interesting statements came at the time
of the alleged UAP shootowns in February
2023 when there was a mass public
hysteria about a balloon from the
Chinese government that was flying
across the continental USA. uh no
explanation of course for the remaining
three unexplained objects, one of which
I'm very very sure was anomalous. But in
the course of the government commentary
about this, the uh White House press
secretary said on the 13th of February
2023, there is again no indication of
aliens or extraterrestrial activity with
these recent takedowns. Wanted to make
sure that the American people knew that.
All of you knew that. And it was
important for us to say that from here
because we've been hearing a lot about
it and yet
a lot of people in Congress aren't
buying it. Jake Kirby, the National
Security Council spokesman uh again on
the 13th of February 2023,
he was asked specifically about the
issue of UAPs and he gave a very kind of
bland vanilla commentary about the
subject of UAPs. He said the president
instructed the intelligence community to
take a broad look at the phenomenon of
UAPs. Indeed, President Biden conducted
the first ever daily intelligence
briefing devoted to this phenomenon back
in June 2021. He was briefed that this
is not just an issue for the United
States, but one for the rest of the
world. And as I said, our friends and
our partners are dealing with this as
well. We've worked on a bipartisan basis
to stand up an office in the Pentagon to
study this in partnership with the
intelligence community, academic
community, and private sector. These
unidentified aerial phenomena have been
reported for many years without
explanation or deep examination by the
government. President Biden has changed
all that. We are finally trying to
understand them better. Well, what a
load of BS. That's completely untrue.
The simple fact is that the role of the
Pentagon's arrow office, the all domain
anomaly resolution office, has been to
maintain the cover up. They have
willfully actively ignored
whistleblowers who've come to them with
very direct firsthand information that
deserves fuller investigation.
So, let's have a look at we'll get to
Trump. I'm saving Trump for later.
former President Trump. We all know that
multiple presidents, at least Obama,
Clinton, Reagan, and Bush Senior, were
all briefed on the UAP subject because
each of them has made admissions or
people close to them have made
admissions that they were briefed.
President Clinton has actually admitted
sending one of his very senior council,
guy called Webster Hubble, to
investigate UFOs and who killed JFK.
And uh Webster later wrote in a book
that quote he'd looked into both but
wasn't satisfied with the answers I was
getting. And that's pretty much what
President Clinton has said about his
efforts to get to the bottom of the UAP
UAP mystery as well. In 1995 when
Clinton was in Ireland on a tour, there
was a little boy called Ryan who'd asked
him about Roswell, the alleged landing
of alien craft in 1947 in New Mexico.
And President Clinton went to great
efforts to say in front of a huge crowd,
"As far as I know, an alien spacecraft
did not land in Roswell, New Mexico in
1947."
And Ryan, if the US Air Force did
recover alien bodies, they didn't tell
me about it either, and I want to know.
And I can tell you that was a very
pointed and quite deliberate comment by
President Clinton because he really did
want to know. He was very well briefed,
I understand, about what had been going
on. And he did make a very genuine
effort to get to the bottom of the
mystery, but he was thwarted, actively
blocked from finding out much more about
what's really going on. It is my
contention that President Clinton was
willfully obstructed by people in the
Pentagon and the intelligence community
from learning more about a covert
retrieval and reverse engineering
program of nonhuman technology.
Think about the implications of what
President Clinton said to that little
boy in Ireland in light of what Louzando
said to me on NewsNation just a few
months ago. Lou went on the record. A
former Pentagon UAP investigator with
top secret SCI clearances went on the
record and actually admitted that he
knew Roswell was the real crash of an
alien spacecraft. He apparently was
cleared within his doppser within his
defense office pre-publication security
review permissions to reveal that
Roswell was indeed the crash of an alien
spacecraft. So either Lu Alzando is
lying or has been misled or the
president of the United States was
misled by whoever it was had told him
that there was no evidence that Roswell
was the crash of an alien spacecraft.
Think about that. This is the
commanderin-chief of the United States
at the time being willfully thwarted by
people in the defense and intelligence
community from learning the truth about
a seinal incident in human history. A
first contact between humans and
nonhuman intelligence. And mark my
words, the public are going to find out,
I suspect, very, very soon that the
president was lied to. And multiple
presidents have been lied to. President
Carter, who had his own UFO sighting
before he became president, pledged in
his original presidential campaign, "One
thing's for sure, I'll never make fun of
people who say they've seen unidentified
objects in the sky. If I become
president, I'll make every piece of
information this country has about UFO
sightings available to the public and
the scientists."
Now, of course, President Carter did not
honor that pledge when he reached
office. The UFO secrets stayed hidden.
But what we do know is that Danny Shien,
who now of course I've mentioned
previously, was is leading a global
disclosure activism effort to expose the
UAP mystery. Danny Shien was hired as
part of a congressional research
investigation
to actually find out what it was that
the government knew about UFOs. and he
has testified that he was given access
as part of that presidentially
authorized investigation to look at
pivot unreleased project blue book files
which he says showed US soldiers
recovering an alien spacecraft. Now that
photograph of course has never been made
public. We've never been able to verify
Denny's claims. But what's very very
interesting is nobody has ever denied it
either. It's it's a really curious
situation we have here that President
Carter
was determined to get to the truth of
the matter, asked for an inquiry, was
initially allegedly knocked back by
George Bush Senior when he was the head
of the CIA, the director of the CIA. And
so he asked for a congressional research
service inquiry uh to be organized by a
woman called Maria Smith. And it was
Marcia Smith who brought Danny Shien in.
And it's Danny Shien, a civil rights
attorney of some renown who says that he
was given permission to access enormous
numbers of UFO files which have never
been released to the public. And these
included the photograph or photographs
of this retrieval of an alien
spacecraft. I find that incredible and I
find it amazing just how willfully
ignorant a lot of the mainstream media
are about following up leads like that.
So that's President Carter. Ronald
Reagan, of course, also had his own
encounter with a UFO in a 1974 plane
flight. And the pilot that night, a guy
called Bill Painter, later described the
object trailing their plane. He
described how it took off at a 45 degree
angle at a huge rate of dis speed. It
just disappeared. Quote, "Everyone on
the plane was surprised. The UFO went
from normal cruise speed to fantastic
speed instantly."
And President Reagan apparently later
described how the object quote went
straight up into the heavens. Whatever
it was, it certainly caught Ronald
Reagan's imagination because Reagan
often talked about aliens. He was very
open about the possibility or the
likelihood of there being aliens
engaging with this planet. And he's of
course very famous for asking his Soviet
counterpart Mikail Gorbachoff during a
Swiss arms control summit. What would
you do? He asked Gorbachoff if the US
was suddenly attacked by someone from
outer space. Would you help us? And
President Gorbachoff answered, no doubt
about it. And Reagan apparently said,
"We too." And I think Reagan was
fascinated by the idea that a threat
from outer space by a non-human
intelligence would bring humanity
together, that we'd forget our
differences and think of ourselves more
as humans. And he actually went on to
use that analogy about an alien attack
in a speech to the United Nations where
he said, quote, "Perhaps we need some
outside universal threat to make us
recognize this common bond. I
occasionally think how quickly our
differences worldwide would vanish if we
were facing an alien threat from outside
this world. And yet I ask you, is not an
alien force already among us? What could
be more alien to the universal
aspirations of our peoples than war and
the threat of war?
Apparently uh Reagan's staff rolled
their eyes when he started talking about
what they peoratively referred to as
little green men. But good on him for
raising the subject because I'm pretty
sure Ronald Reagan was briefed into what
we now know is the legacy UAP retrieval
and reverse engineering program. And so
was former uh President Obama after he
was president. In 2021, former President
Barack Obama told James Cordon, quote,
"When I came into the office, I was
like, all right, is there a lab
somewhere where we're keeping the alien
specimens and spaceship?" And you know,
they did a little bit of research, and
the answer was no.
And I'm telling you, President Obama was
lied to. Think about that again. a
commander and chief of the United States
of America was willfully lied to by
people within the defense and
intelligence community about just what
it is that the United States has hidden
away in private facilities, possibly
within the confines of a private
aerospace company. What uh Obama has
said is I'm being serious here is that
there is footage and records of objects
in the skies that we don't know exactly
what they are. We can't explain how they
moved, their trajectory. They did not
have an easily explainable pattern. Now,
that was a profound comment for a former
president to make and especially in the
context of what I know is that
apparently President Obama sought and
received a top secret SCI briefing on
the UAP issue after he was president. He
wasn't briefed while he was president.
But it's quite profound. I think Obama
probably more than any other president
has come close to admitting that there
really is something to this mystery.
Now, let's get to Trump. As former
President Trump has acknowledged, one of
the questions he's been getting asked
the most on the campaign trail is what
the government really knows about UFOs
and UAPs. And this isn't the only time
he's talked about this. In the final
weeks again of the last 2020 election
campaign, he was asked by his son, Don
Trump Jr., if he would ever tell the
public about the alleged 1947 Roswell
incident. And I think what uh President
Trump said at the time was very telling.
It was a very clearly pre-organized Q&A.
It was a bit of a nudge nudge wink wink.
He knew the question was coming and he
couldn't help himself. He had this
ironic smile on his lips as he answered
and Don Trump was practically giggling
behind the camera. And uh President
Trump said, "I won't talk to you about
what I know about it, but it's very
interesting."
Now, that's one hell of a hint from then
President Trump. So, in October 2020,
Trump also pledged that he also would
take a good strong look at the
government program on UFOs. And this
came shortly after the Pentagon had
announced a task force in 2020 to
investigate the subject. He's a bit of a
tease Trump because sometimes he feigns
complete indifference to the subject of
UAPs UFOs. I suspect because he's
frightened of the cusenich phenomenon.
He's frightened of the public blowback
if he admits what I suspect to be the
case which is that he's actually
intensely interested in the subject. And
that's belied by the fact that he had
that curious exchange with his son Don
Jr. And let's not forget also what
happened in December 2020. I think this
is one of the very interesting
roadblocks or roadmarks along the way.
Heim Ish is a very very wellrespected
very senior former head of the Israeli
Defense Ministry Space Directorate in
December 2020 gave an interview to a
Hebrew newspaper where he claimed that
aliens have asked for it not to be
published that they are here on this
planet because quote humanity is not
ready yet. And Mr. had also claimed that
President Trump knew of the existence of
these aliens on this planet and that he
was on the verge of revealing the
details, but was asked not to do so
because of concerns from within the
Pentagon and the intelligence community
of mass public hysteria. How blooming
condescending if that's really the case,
why we're not being told this full
story. Is it really the case that the
public would get hysterical if we
learned about the existence of a
non-human intelligence? I really
strongly doubt that.
To put what we're talking about here
today in context, multiple presidents
have promised over many, many decades to
get to the bottom of the UAP mystery,
and all of them have failed mystery
miserably. And that's why I think we
really should take what President uh
former President Trump is saying with a
huge grain of salt. As early as 1948,
President Truman ordered oral briefings
on a weekly basis to be given to him by
the US Air Force because he was
concerned that the spate of UFO
sightings over the country at that time
were a national security threat and an
issue that he needed to be across as
president. So coming back to Trump, Lex
Friedman, Lex Friedman interviewed do
Donald Trump in September this year and
he asked Trump, "A lot of people are
interested in footage of UFOs. Will you
help push the Pentagon to release more
footage, which a lot of people claim is
available." And Trump answered, "Oh
yeah, sure. I would do that. I'd love to
do that. I have to do that." And he also
promised to release classified documents
on the JFK assassination. Well, look,
frankly, I'm not holding my breath, but
I do think the public should hold Mr.
Trump to his promise if he does become
president.
In another in uh appearance on the Hugh
Hewitt podcast in September last year,
former President Trump admitted he was
formally briefed on UFOs during his time
as president. And I've heard this as
well that he sought and received what
I'm told was a very limited briefing on
what the US actually does know about
UFOs. But I'm told he was briefed into
the fact that the US has retrieved
nonhuman technology craft and that there
is an active reverse engineering program
underway.
Now, he's also acknowledged that he's
spoken to pilots. And I think sometimes
this is used to muddy the waters to
suggest that the only briefing that he
ever received was from pilots who told
him about incidents like the Nimttz
incident from 2004 where a swarm of UFOs
were seen around uh a US battleship
carrier fleet. Um that's not the case.
This was a formal briefing that the
president was given at the time. In June
this year, Donald Trump told Logan Paul
that he has access to UFO files after
being asked about what information he
had about the existence of alien life.
And there's a lot of skepticism about
that because frankly his security
clearances were cailed quite stringently
by President Biden after the appalling
recklessness with which he dealt with
very secret files, top secret SCI files
at Mara Lago. And that of course led to
the FBI raid and the subsequent um
attempts to prosecute former President
Trump for keeping hold of files that he
denied having possession of. But in the
course of that interview with Logan
Paul, Trump was asked, "Am I a
believer?" No, I probably can't say that
I am. But I have met with people that
are serious people that say there are
some really strange things that they see
flying out there. They have people that
are very smart and very solid who've
said they believe there was something
out there. And you know, it makes sense
that they could be. I've never been
convinced even despite that, you know, I
just for some reason it's not my thing.
But a lot of people believe that it's
true. A lot of very good solid people
believe it's true. Now, I do not for a
moment believe that Trump is in any
doubt whatsoever about the reality of
the non-human intelligences engaging
with our planet because I know that he's
been briefed about it. And I think
what's happening is he's terrified of
putting a foot wrong and finding himself
again facing the accusation that he has
breached national security constraints
by revealing what he was given a
briefing about by a a very very closed
group of people. Now, he also um uh was
asked when he was asked about aliens, he
he told he said that he'd spoken to Air
Force personnel who claimed to see
aircraft round in form going like four
or times four or five times faster than
my super jet fighter plane. I think he's
referring to the F-22.
And I mean a lot of what um President
Trump has said about this is
contradictory at times, but pressed on
whether he had access to information on
alien life and UAPs by Logan Paul, Trump
actually replied, "I have access and I
speak to people about it. I've actually
had meetings on it and they will tell
you there's something going on."
So, I do think we have to be extremely
careful with promises made by any
presidential candidate that they're
going to release the UFO files. I don't
know what they tell these guys when they
get into power, but what I'm told with
the Democrat side of things is that the
decision was made by Jake Sullivan, the
national security adviser to the
president, President Biden, that uh
because the Schumer amendment didn't
pass in December of 2023, the subject of
potential disclosure of UAP information
would be put on the shelf on the back
burner for another year or so. They
didn't want to have this as an election
issue throughout 2024. So for the
current president uh Joe Biden and for
Kla Harris, it's been a non-issue. And
she's made absolutely no comment about
this on the campaign trail because the
weak need flippity jibbit soft toffee
slick spittles that constitute the
mainstream media have completely failed
to ask the question. But Trump, Trump's
an enigma. Watch him closely. He knows
something. I know he knows something. I
know he's been briefed and he wants to
talk about it. And it is very much part
of his theme to break down the bulwicks
of the dark state. If there really is a
cover up that's lied to consecutive
presidents about the truth on UAPs,
I suspect Donald Trump might very well
want to be the president that breaks
that story wide open.
Thanks very much for joining Reality
Check and Heaven helpers, good luck in
the election.
Hello and welcome back to Reality Check.
Today we've got Andrea Lani to speak to
Dr. Andrea Lani. Dr. Andrea Lani is an
Italian-born Belgianbased aerospace
scientist with a PhD in engineering
sciences. He's worked with institutions
such as NASA, Stanford, the NATO Science
and Technology Organization, and the Von
Carman Institute, leading the
development of models and software for
hypersonic re-entry, space weather, and
solar phenomena simulations. He's been
published in the world's top journal for
aerospace engineering, the prestigious
progress in aerospace sciences. He has
co-authored more than 100 scientific
papers so far and he's currently working
on an EU project developing a magnetic
shielding prototype for space vehicles.
Now, this is where it gets interesting
because outside of his official work,
and Andrea is at pains to emphasize that
his esoteric and paranormal interests
have no connection at all with any of
the official institutions that he works
with. Dr. ANI has been a lifong
experiencer of UAPs and other anomalous
phenomena since an extraordinary event
that he and his family witnessed when he
was an 8-year-old boy. A lot of his
private research focuses on using deep
meditation inspired by protocols
developed by the CIA, the Central
Intelligence Agency in the 1970s.
They're the so-called Stargate
protocols. And he uses this to gain an
understanding of the anomalous phenomena
that he says he's experiencing,
including time anomalies and even
psychic interaction and communication
with nonhuman
intelligences. And like the solid
scientist he is, he's exploring ways to
verify and measure the phenomenon. It's
his work with hyperspectral video
imaging of his brain during deep
meditation that I think perhaps you'll
find most intriguing. I am delighted to
announce that we have a sponsor on
reality check and that sponsor is none
other than a martial arts god that when
I was a little boy I worshiped
intensely. I had his posters on my wall
and he inspired me to learn karate and
other martial arts as a young teenager.
I'm talking about Chuck Norris. When I
was a little boy, there was one movie
that I went to watch about five times in
1972 called The Way of the Dragon. And
it was Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris facing
off against each other in the Colosseum
in Rome. It was just mighty stuff. And
would you believe Chuck Norris is now 84
years old. And while I have broken hands
and knees and ankles because of my
foolish interest in karate, whacking
boards in a dojo late into the night.
Chuck Norris's body defies explanation.
The man is 84 years old and yet he's
still got the vigor of a man 30 or 40
years younger than him. He's still
kicking butt and working hard. And
what's amazing is he's stronger. He can
work out longer and has plenty of energy
left over for his grandkids. He did
this, he tells us, by making one change.
And he says he still feels like he's in
his 50s. His wife's even done the same
thing as well, and she's never felt
better. She says she feels 10 years
younger. Her body looks leaner, and she
has energy all day. And Chuck's made a
special video that explains everything.
And make sure you help us and Chuck by
watching it. If you go to
chuckdefense.com/ros
and click in the link below in this
video, it'll change the way you think
about your health. Now, once again,
that's chuckdefense.com/ros.
Click on the link in the description
below to watch the video. You won't
believe how simple it is. Just a
reminder, the legendary Chuck Norris is
a whopping 84 years old. And yet, he's
got more energy than me, and his body
may be broken, but for some reason, he
seems to be able to keep on going. I
want to know his secret. I'm going to
click on that link. What he's discovered
that he could affect dramatic changes to
his health simply focusing on three
things that sabotage our body as we age.

Dr. Lani, welcome to Reality Check.
>> Thanks so much for having me here.
>> So, Andrea, tell me a little bit about
this incident that happened, I think,
when you were an 8-year-old boy. This is
the I think the first time that you were
twigged to the anomalous phenomena.
>> Absolutely. So it was 1983 and it was uh
during August and um I was basically on
a on a balcony with my parents and uh
suddenly it was during the night maybe
like 10:00 or something. It was already
dark. There was absolutely nobody around
in the street or in other balconies and
um suddenly we noticed this object that
appears at the same altitude as our
balcony. uh so about 15 meters from the
ground like I don't know 45 feet or
something like that and like 10 meters
in front so like 30 feet or something
and uh the as soon as I look at the
object the object immediately started
spinning became luminos and uh I'm
talking about a spinning like like
almost like seeing a a flying turbine
like thousands of RPM and actually I
also remember that while it was spinning
I I noticed already back then the
wobbling around the the you know the the
axis of rotation and uh while spinning
it shrank progressively
uh till when it actually disappeared uh
while emitting a flesh of light and then
after that I turned on my left and I
asked my mother did you see that uh she
said yes and I said what was it
according to you and she said oh maybe
it was a falling star now my mother is
no scientist I was eight years old but I
already knew that that was not a falling
star just how many
H how many people were there with you at
the time this phenomenon showed itself?
>> Well, my parents. So, we were three in
total. Uh my father doesn't have
particular recollections. Uh my mother
vaguely remembered the the the
phenomenon. But the problem is I don't
know exact I was looking at the
phenomenon. I wasn't looking at what
they were doing. So maybe my father was
distracted and my mother only got a
glimpse of it. But what I know is that
it was not a falling star because it was
standing in front of us. So
>> was there a noise?
>> I remember no noise whatsoever.
But uh one thing that uh was interesting
is that few months after this uh let's
say experience uh I started losing a
little bit of sight and I had to wear
glasses and that actually I always found
very weird the fact that I was the only
one in my family and I have a very large
family like 17 siblings on the side of
my father and five on the side of my
mother. I was the only one at the time
wearing glasses and uh but I never
connected it to this event. But recently
I yeah I saw that I I read somewhere
that there are other people who actually
experienced something like that in
closing after a close encounter. They
they lost a bit of sight and and then I
connected the dots. I said wow this was
just few months after this event.
Now doctor, one of the things as a
scientist that I'm sure you'll want to
understand and I hope you understand,
I've got to be skeptical. You know, this
is an account that is quite
extraordinary because I think what you
say is that you've developed throughout
your lifetime psychic abilities that you
have a um an ability to use your mind in
ways that go beyond what we understand
the brain to be capable of. Did you have
those abilities before this incident?
Are you aware as a child before this
incident having these skills?
>> Absolutely not. And actually these
abilities came very late in my life. Uh
I think the the first experience that I
can associate to some sort of
recognition
uh was in 2016 and this was u few days
before the terrorist attack in Brussels.
Uh I remember I was walking u it was a
Sunday e uh afternoon. I was walking
next to the central station and suddenly
I meet these two women. uh they
approached me with a very weird English
and I said okay you can talk Italian I
understand and uh and then uh and then
they basically told me well we are
teachers and we are here with our
classrooms and we want to go with the
kids to visit the museum of Napoleon and
uh and I said wow you're really lucky
because I work in the village next to
Waterlue and I go to Waterlue every
single day for lunch so you are asking
the right the right person you know and
and so I said okay where are you staying
And they said, "Well, we have a hotel
nearby the the central station." I said,
"Well, you know, you just take a train
from here. Take a bus and then you you
you go there." And then they told me,
"But you know, we are in Brussels and we
would like the kids to try the metro."
When they told me metro, I had this
flash in my mind and I I saw I thought
about the Paris attack and I and I
thought about I I had an image of a
metro blowing up and I didn't say
anything but I tried anyway to
discourage them to take the metro. So I
told them uh I think if you if you if
you try to take the metro early in the
morning with all these kids uh you will
get in trouble because it's really busy.
So what happened is the day of the
attack which was two days later in which
actually they bombed the metros as well.
Um my mother told me about an interview
that she saw to an Italian guy who
survived. And while looking for this
interview, what I actually found online
was an article talking about these two
teachers with their kids showing a
picture saying that basically they
actually took the metro and they took it
they took actually the metro before the
one that was bombed. So I don't know if
I played a role in that event to prevent
something to happen, but definitely I
had a premonition. So that was the first
time.
So, so you would call that a
precognition if you like. You had some
kind of telepathic pre sentient notion
of what was going to happen.
>> I think so.
>> So, let's go back a little bit in your
childhood because I know that the
incident that happened to you when you
were 8 years old, that's not the only
incident, is it? And you also had an
uncle who reported seeing something very
similar uh in the same place where you
and your family had your experience.
>> Absolutely. So this happened uh a couple
of weeks after we had already left and
uh he was on the same balcony originally
alone and uh he was looking up and on
his left high in the sky about 150 m
let's say 450 ft or something he saw
this object arriving very slowly
rotating
and it was like uh blasting some uh some
beams of light of different color. So it
was a traditional uh let's say dome with
a with a saucer under it spinning very
slowly and uh he called the wife he said
come to the balcony look up do you see
it and she saw it as well and then they
look at it she he said for about 45
seconds more or less this this was his
perception of time and uh and then the
object suddenly increased the rotation
speed became like a a glowing uh red
ball of light and uh and darted off at
an incredible speed after this. Yeah.
After
>> it's an amazing story. I mean, did he
photograph it? Is there a corroborative
witness? His wife says she saw the same
thing, I suspect.
>> Yeah, the the wife saw the same thing.
He didn't have time to to take any
picture, but they both experienced some
sort of hallucination during the night.
Uh so he while waking up he opens his
eyes and he has the impression of seeing
a face of a of a human but made of fire
with long hair that was like trembling
like that. And and then he was like
shake up a little bit and it
disappeared. And then he was talking to
the wife and said and the wife said you
know this night I had a very strange
dream. I I saw Jesus Christ made of fire
uh in our bedroom. And so by connecting
what he saw with this guy with long hair
and what she saw in her dream, it's an
interesting coincidence.
So
>> So Andrea, you're a scientist. What What
has been the the big incident in your
life that convinced you that you were
seeing something that is genuinely
anomalous? Obviously, as an 8-year-old,
boy, that's quite an amazing incident,
but I can imagine there's been more
recent incidents. Take me through the
array of phenomena that you've
experienced.
>> Yes. So, I had to wait till uh 2017 to
actually have another UFO encounter,
again, a very close one. And this time
it was very different. So, basically, I
was uh stargazing during the night in
this house. And um I I thought I had
this thought, how cool would it be to
have the same experience that I had when
I was a child now that I'm an aerospace
engineer and I could, you know, look at
details and and uh understand a little
better what I'm looking at. And uh and
then I I I basically went to sleep at
the time that I was my ex-girlfriend
already lying on the bed and uh she made
me notice a very strange sound. It was
like a high pitch kind of squeaking and
I couldn't associate it to any u any
machinery or anything consider it was
one one o'lock in the night and uh so I
was basically staring at the at the
ceiling at a certain moment I see a
single ray of green light entering from
my window and in the matter of one
second the whole room is completely
enlightened in bright green light and so
I look at her I said let's go to the
window. Let's see what happened. And I
remember she basically turned her face
to the wall and said, "No, let me
sleep." I didn't want to investigate
that. I just wanted to see what the hell
was going on in my backyard. So, I
pulled the curtain and I saw two discs
of green light, very bright green light
that were they were moving together,
flying over my backyard. The perception
of distance for me was like maybe 10
mters or something of of disorder. uh
because if they were really high in the
sky, they were gigantic. So I tend to
believe they were very close and they
were relatively small about 2 meters in
in diameter each. How I can I can
estimate that is that I saw them passing
over the the roof of the neighbor and I
know the size of the facade of the
neighbor which is more or less six
meters. So and then I went upstairs to
to try to see if I could see further and
I couldn't. But you know that was
interesting interesting to to have this
kind of experience immediately after
having asked for it.
>> Now Andrea, you actually became a
scientist, didn't you? Because of that
incident that happened to you when you
were an 8-year-old boy.
>> Absolutely. That
>> can you tell me tell me why? What what
what was the reason? Well,
let's say that it got me interested in
uh in technology, got me interested in
in you know physics, astrophysics and uh
when I had to decide what to do in life,
my thought was I want to get to a point
in my life in which I understand what I
saw that day because I understood that
that was uh very anomalous. It was like
almost peeping through a door that lead
you somewhere else. And um so yeah and
basically when I had to decide what to
do I was undecided between astrophysics
and and engineering aerospace
engineering and they suggested me to to
go towards engineering because I would
have had more chances to find a job as
an engineer than a physicist and uh and
I followed that. The funny thing is that
later in life I ended up working
together with astrophysicist as well. So
now I'm working a little bit on the
modeling of space weather and a little
bit on the modeling on of hypersonic
flows around space vehicles. So
>> So I've got to ask this Dr. Lani in the
course of your work for NASA or any of
these agencies. Have you ever come
across an aerospace technology that you
think defies conventional explanation?
>> Absolutely not. But I have to say I
never had the chance to to work on
classified technology. So it was mostly
you know simulation of some experiments
which are non non-classified you can
publish them and it was rather ordinary
you know technology for hypersonic uh
vehicles. So yeah definitely not. Where
do you stand on the speculation pushed
by people whom I know you know David
Grush and others who are suggesting that
there is this secret reverse engineering
program going on inside private
aerospace and indeed in sections of the
US government and intelligence community
that is concealing the retrieval of
nonhuman technology. Do you find it
plausible?
>> Yeah, absolutely. I I think that there
have been during these decades a lot of
high-profile people who came out with
with inside insider information and uh I
I don't know why I I would doubt this
kind of people. So
and what do you think the attitude is
within your profession to your attitudes
towards the paranormal and anomalous
phenomena? Is it received with
skepticism or is there a greater
willingness to be open-minded about the
possibilities of this kind of phenomena?
>> Yeah, what I can say is that uh in my in
my own environment, what I saw is that
uh a lot of people of course is skeptic
but also a lot of people have no
knowledge whatsoever about the
phenomenon. They have never researched
anything. Maybe they saw sometimes
something popping up on the news or in a
local newspaper but you know they never
research it actively but then once you
focus the attention on some people uh on
some of the stuff then they get
interested and uh I have seen I have uh
during during let's say the last few
years I have seen astrophysicists I have
seen space engineers people that uh you
know in my environment if I would tell
you know that this person actually is
very interested in that and actually had
experiences they would not believe it
but you know so there is a a group that
is growing of people that are getting
information are getting experiences also
within the environment in which I'm
working which normally is very uh you
know stigmadriven and very close-minded
>> I was going to ask is there a is there a
risk of blowback for you in speaking so
candidly about your experiences with
what after all can easily be stigmatized
and treated with taboo and suspicion.
>> Yes, there is there is a risk. Uh I I
received pressure before from multiple
sources but I have to say uh it comes to
a moment in which people need to be
aware that uh these phenomenon are real
and there are a lot of people and I'm
not talking about just thousands
millions of people who are having
experiences and we are not talking about
just uh Chinese balloons. So somebody
who has experiences, especially somebody
like me also with a scientific
background that has maybe more tools
than others to evaluate if an experience
is anomalous or just ordinary. I think
you know people in this position have to
have the courage to come out and say
okay I had that experience and I can
tell you at least for you know for what
I know about physics or or or technology
that that thing was not uh not normal
non nonhuman probably so
>> okay um I'm going to show you a video
that you very kindly sent me earlier
which um is an attempt I understand by
you to explain the phenomenon. The video
of you versus the journalist. So, um
there's an image of you on the left and
your whole head is very largely
illuminated with a yellow light, a
golden light, and on the right there's
what appears to be a woman's face. And I
I presume this is some kind of infrared
or perhaps a hyperspectral imaging
camera. talk me through what we're
looking at.
>> Okay, so first of all, just a little bit
of story about how how I got there. Um,
so in 2023, I got connected with this
Italian journalist called Sabrina
Sabrina Piraini who actually uh wrote
about four books about UFOs and some
other phenomena. And she involved me
actually in her last one. Uh she was
looking for somebody writing the forward
and uh we connected. I share some of my
experiences. She said she said would be
nice to have you write in the forward.
So that's how I got connected to her and
then after that she said I know some
people that would be really interesting
to do some test with you. So what I told
her is that you know since some time uh
I have these experiences which after I
medit I mean during meditation whether I
do it alone or with other people we sort
of create create some sort of connection
with other beings and um so people feel
energies have visions and I did also
some test at the institute of noetic
sciences in which they did some
experiments with EEG on 11 meditators
and what they saw is that for each of
the 11 meditators u their brain waves uh
changed dramatically uh um when they
were doing a meditation like freestyle
the way they wanted and a meditation
like that I had pre-recorded on videos
saying explicitly I'm going to connect
you what I call it a stargate or let's
say a portal or some kind of
communication channel and what they saw
is that for each of them if you look at
the brain waves from delta to to to
gamma there were considerable
differences um for all of the
participants and some of them also had
experiences uh like like the one that I
you know uh that that people meditating
with me had. So at some point I I was
looking for more evidence and uh so
thanks to the journalist we we met in
Milan with two guys one is a forensic
technical consultant he's also
electronic engineer and the other one is
a physicist or an engineer. They work
together and they develop actually these
hyperspectral cameras that can see
beyond the visible. So in both in
ultraviolet and infrared and uh what
they did is they put they placed two
cameras. One was a polarimetric camera
mounting a sensor which is actually used
by space agencies and another one was
another camera hyperspectral and they
did different kind of measurements while
I was meditating. So when I meditate I
instantaneously drop into some state and
I connect and what they could see. So
first of all they they also um tested
the journalist as a point of reference
of the day in the same place you know
same time and uh but they had already
tested about 30 people before uh and
what they saw is that for people who
don't have any contact experience or any
meditation experience they all fit the
same uh kind of energetic signature
which is the one that you see for the
for the journalist in the in the video.
So basically you see basically the the
the energy is mostly concentrated in the
eyes. So the highest level of energy
which is visualized in this case with
white light or golden if you want is
concentrated in the eyes and then there
is maybe some little activity but in my
case this energy is is distributed
equally over all my face except for a
region which is very well defined that
almost look like a mask around my eyes
and it never changed and the interesting
thing was that even when I'm not
meditating this high level of energy is
present so it's like a permanent feature
that is anomalous. They never seen
something like that that I have.
>> And was that with the was that with the
hyperspectral camera or with the what
did you say it was the polometric
camera?
>> Polometric like to measure the
polarization of light but also in that
case it works uh it works in the you
know UV UV and um and infrared range.
And so this one we're looking at now,
this is the hyperspectral camera and
that shows the golden light right across
your head apart from your eyes and the
same eye light is emanating just from
the woman's eyes in her section. Was she
meditating at all?
>> Uh not really. No, but uh another thing
that I have to say so you're looking at
the energy uh senator and what they are
measuring is actually the biophotonic
field. So we emit light and so they can
but we emit light also in the infrared
and the ultraviolet. So that's what
they're interested in and that's where
they see things happening. So another
thing that you see happening in my case
is this tooidal field that forms around
my head and uh and also occasionally
forms a sort of cross and then I
remember when we were doing the test the
guy said whoa look at that you see this
cross and then they say well it's almost
like you are targeted by something. Um
but and then the other one said, "Yeah,
but it looks like it's coming, you know,
out of your face. It's not really
something coming from outside." So
>> So what is it, Dr. Lani? Explain it to
me, please. You're the scientist. What
does it mean?
>> I what I can say, I have my own theory.
Uh what I can say is that you know in
spiritual circles they always talk about
raising your vibration through
meditation increase your frequency your
energy and uh I think you can get to a
point in which this becomes measurable.
So also you know in uh since centuries
people have been talking about kind of
enlightenment you know but is this
measurable? Maybe this is a measure of
some kind of enlightenment or you know a
measure of a process towards what they
call enlightenment. Definitely is not a
glitch. It's something you know they did
the test three times and in between they
tested the the journalist. The settings
of the camera were completely the same
and the difference in energy is really
like if you see between the dark and the
and the light in there is is really
consistent. So it's like they say you
know this is really something.
>> So what's what's your hypothesis when
when you're meditating? Are you are you
aware that you are communicating with
something somewhere else?
>> Absolutely. Actually
>> what what are you feeling? What's what's
going through your head? I I I got into
meditation with the specific purpose of
making connection. But it it took some
time to have the you know haha moment in
which you really feel something you feel
energy uh you see stuff and then they
tell you will give you a sign and then
this thing happened and uh like uh
anyway so in the process the at this at
this point because anyway I've been
doing this already for four years. Uh at
this point I just close my eyes and I
and and basically I can connect whenever
I want and when I decide to connect I
feel a sort of electric impulse and
sometimes this electric impulse makes my
head uh twitch a little bit and you see
it even in these videos and it's
something really physical is it's like
you you create some sort of energetic
connection uh which manifests itself in
your body being traversed by high
frequency currents that in some way they
don't burn you. is like you know if you
have high frequency currents going
through uh a material unless this
material is a superconductors it will
generate heating and I know about
superconductors because I I'm working in
projects dealing with that. So for my
understanding you can get to a point in
which your body works as a
superconductor for these energies and
and then the fun begins. So I don't know
if I I think I got to that point. I
don't know how I don't know why me.
There are many many other people I think
who have similar experiences. It's just
that maybe they're not so vocal and
maybe they don't have a chance to do
this kind of test. Luckily I, you know,
I know engineers, I know people with
technology and I can experiment.
>> So when you communicate, yeah, I'm
really interested in drilling down into
what you say happens when you meditate.
Are you saying that you are consciously
engaging with something that is an
intelligence that is non-human?
>> Yes, that's what I'm saying. Um, and
what I can say or what from my point of
view, from my understanding at the
moment, uh, we are not just engaging
with uh one kind of intelligence. It's
very busy out of out there and u so
people have been trying to you know
communicate with angels with gods since
millennia and uh and I believe this is a
actual possibility you can actually
engage in this kind of communication and
uh and they are able to interact even on
the physical level with you and I make
you an example the first time that I had
this connection during meditation so I
felt this extraordinary energy
My eyelids started flickering in an
uncontrollable way and uh and then I
started having these very vivid visuals
of entities but I couldn't see them like
in details. I could just see robbed
entities emanating some light on on my
left in blue on my right in green and
then I saw a face which maybe you will
show later on. Um but then then I asked
okay but if the then they told me the
message that I was receiving is that you
can do this kind of meditation with
other people and they will have similar
experiences as you will have uh and you
can use this for healings and then I
said okay well healings let's try with
myself at the time I had a ligament
injury on my left wrist it was a relapse
the previous time I had to take a
cortisone injection and this was already
you know almost a year before and then I
had another accident and uh a lot of
pain. Sometimes I couldn't even the day
before I couldn't hold the cup without
feeling pain uh up to my elbow. So I
said, "Okay, if you can really heal, can
you heal this one?" And then what
happened is I did a meditation and I
even forgot exactly what was the purpose
of the meditation. I had connection and
then I'm walking out from the park and I
hear this internal voice like, "Check
your wrist." I was like, "Oh yeah." And
then I, you know, I moved the the wrist
in whatever way. I put pressure, I lift
weights,
it was solved. And he never came back
again.
So
>> now, can I can I put on my I feel duty
bound to to be the skeptic because um
you're a scientist. What you're claiming
there is obviously quite extraordinary.
And you're not the first person, by the
way, Dr.
to tell me you've had phenomena like
this. Interestingly, one of the people
that I've spoken to and he told me this
in great detail in another interview was
um Professor Gary Nolan from Stanford
University, not talking about healing
but talking about vibrations. I think
the thing that really struck me from
what you were saying very early on was
this description of your whole body
vibrating.
Um, and it's a very it's a very common
phenomenon described by people who
believe that they're having encounters
with non-human intelligences.
Why, as a scientist, do you believe that
what is happening to you is most likely
engagement with a non-human
intelligence? Just to put my debunker
skeptic hat on for a moment, you know,
isn't it possible that that this is some
kind of dream state or hallucination?
Why do you believe it's real? Well, if
this dream also manifest in your life
with physical events like uh like a
healing or like they tell you go to this
place and uh and something will happen
and then you go to that that place and
you see signs related exactly to the
thing that they they told you uh a month
before that would happen. I mean we
don't have the time to go into all the
details. uh but I had all kind of
experiences that gave me absolutely no
doubt that I'm in contact with something
which is nonhuman
or may maybe it's cosmic maybe spiritual
whatever it is is something outside the
visible world
>> now this is what I want to explore with
you doctor because I'm really struck I
was listening to a Joe Rogan interview
the other day with Robert Epstein and um
uh he was talking about the idea a of
the brain being a transducer and the
idea that essentially a lot of memory is
not stored in the brain. He believes,
but he speculated that perhaps what the
brain is is a device that allows us to
convert energy to communicate with
somewhere else. And a lot of this goes
through in modern mythology in a lot of
the uh stories that go back in um you
know even ancient
ancient texts they talk about the
importance of the pineal gland uh in the
brain. Can you talk to that please? What
what do you know about the pineal gland
and and basically why is it relevant to
you having the experiences that you've
had and let's talk about the images that
you've been able to get showing what
happens to your is it pineal or pineal
gland in your brain.
>> Yeah. So I I believe we function like
some sort of antennas and we constantly
emit senials and also receive signals
and then if you're able to tap in
specific frequencies maybe you can
receive communication from elsewhere
right um and uh so basically these tests
were conducted uh in the same day in
which I did the test with the with this
hyperspectral camera and uh they're just
looking at the at the data in a
different Okay. So they are able
basically to visualize the the activity
in terms of frequencies of whatever part
of the of the image they focus on. They
take a a video in you know in full
spectrum and then they focus they can
focus on your eyes. They can focus on
your brain. They can focus so in that
picture they focus in particular on uh a
place close to the to the pineal gland.
What what they found also in previous
studies uh is that uh when they analyze
meditators they see some sort of
tortional field generating in this area
and you see the the spinning of this
energy or let's say this this structure
and uh and they can visualize it they
can visualize basically different
frequenc frequencies with different
colors. So in these images what you see
is exactly that you see some some you
know a tortional kind of field spanning
different frequencies and different
colors but the the interesting thing
that I never seen before were these
flashes of light that blasted off my
body as soon as I connected. So at the
beginning you see the image is like gray
black and white with just some little
activity in here. That's how you should
see it normally. But once I start
>> and and just ju just so I'm clear um in
the images that you've sent me um
there's a screenshot in black and white
of you meditating and you see a green
spot at the point on on your skull where
the pineal gland would be located.
>> Yeah. So indeed, so you cannot drill a
hole in your heads, but that's the the
closest location in which you can
monitor the activity around that area,
you know.
>> And so what what's the camera that's
being used there again? Is that the
hyperspectral camera?
>> Yes, it's a hyperspectral camera. We're
talking about cameras which are custom
made. They use also special software and
special hardware like the the computers
have to be cooled down more than
traditional computers because they use
very heavy postprocessing algorithms and
uh and yeah so they can look whatever at
whatever they also look at my eyes
unfortunately I don't have any picture
for that but they they look at the the
light coming off my eyes and normally
with people they see that uh both in uh
in amplitude and frequency uh the the
light coming off the eyes are um are
different like different amplitude
different uh they are not in phase but
as soon as I start meditating they saw
that actually they overlap perfectly
both in amplitude and uh frequency for
both eyes and but they the the the
frequency um it's much higher it's like
order of magnitude higher than the
frequency they normally see of the light
coming off the eyes of other people. So,
>> and and is this is this a is this a
frequency that you've been able to
measure? Like do you know the frequency
at which the pineal gland is operating
when it's having this connection?
>> No, I don't know. I should I should ask
uh these guys uh but uh yeah normally
they look also within the range 050
earth because that's also the the range
of the of the brain waves. Uh so they
can also visualize the activity of the
of the different brain waves delta,
theta, alpha, beta, gamma, you know. So
So do you believe what you're seeing
there in that imagery is visual evidence
to show that your pineal gland is doing
something
separately from the rest of the brain.
that it might be perhaps for example as
Robert Epstein speculates it might be
operating like some kind of transducer.
>> Absolutely. That's what uh what we
believe.
And so what fascinates me is that
through history, even ancient history,
there's imagery even in the Egyptian uh
antiquity of what looks like the pineal
gland on some of the walls on the uh
ancient monuments in ancient Egypt and
and you see this image of what is
structured like a pineal gland. Do you
think there is a knowledge that was held
by the ancients that we perhaps in our
modern era have lost?
>> Yeah, absolutely. So they they consider
the the pineal gland as a sort of point
of contact between uh worlds like our
material world and the spiritual world
and uh even if you know you you find
this reference in uh in Egyptian but you
even find it in Christianity and uh it's
a bit more hidden but uh but they they
absolutely know what what they they talk
about when when when discussing about
pineal gland. So, let's talk about the
weird anomalous phenomena that you've
experienced in your life. Obviously, you
said that you saw another um UFO in
2017.
Did you have any anomalous phenomena in
that period between the age of 8 and in
2017 or was your life pretty normal up
until then? I didn't see UFOs but uh I
had uh I had some kind of sleep
paralysis experiences in which I would
wake up. This happened three times in
touring and twice or maybe three times
in Belgium in Brussels. Uh so this was
around 1999 2000 so the years in which I
was writing my thesis basically. And um
so I woke up completely paralyzed, fully
conscious, feeling as I was levitating.
I couldn't move even a a little finger
trying to open my eyes, nothing. And I
would feel this very intense vibration
throughout my body at a very high
frequency. I've been in earthquakes.
This was something completely different.
And it was coming from inside my body.
And at the same time I was also feeling
a a high pitch sound inside my head that
was increasing in frequency by the
second. And uh so I panicked and I
started praying mother Mary and it
stopped. And then it happened again
within few weeks and again I panicked
and after that experience I started
researching online. Internet was not as
developed as now but you could find some
information. So that some people were
saying well you know sleep paralysis is
just a you know a psychological
temporary disorder of your system. Some
were saying well it can be a
intermediate stage be before an out of
body experience and some other were
talking about abductions. Now in
abduction sometimes they people reported
including also maybe ginolan seeing
entities around the bed or something
that I couldn't see absolutely nothing.
I would just feel this very intense, you
know, vibration and sound. And so it
happened again. This time I tried to
control the fear and I said, "Okay,
let's see how far this goes." And
actually, no, it just stopped again. And
uh it happened again like six years
later when I was in Brussels. I wasn't
surprised. I was actually excited in the
moment. It said, "Yeah, maybe this time
something happens." And then it stopped
and then it happened another time and
that's it. So I would say uh yeah I
didn't have any other well I had another
experience which was interesting in
South Africa in 2006.
So basically we were we were driving and
we saw we noticed that u there was a
bunch of whales that came very close to
the to the cliffs. So we we stopped the
car and we started running towards the
cliff to to see it was like 15 20 whales
even you know coming out of the water
and I was the last one and I started
running. When I arrived there, I
basically stepped on something, bumped
into something, and my body completely
lost the balance, and I felt I I had
this flesh in my mind, I'm dead because
there was no way that something could
balance back my body at that speed to to
not fall down the cliff. It was really a
straight fall. And I felt this pressure,
a strong uh wind pushing in my in my
chest and putting me back on my on my
feet. And uh yeah, so at the time I
didn't say anything to anybody. I think
not even to my girlfriend, but uh this
thing remain in my mind. It's like I in
my mind I was already dead. There was no
way I could I could stop myself in that
in the situation. So yeah,
>> you mentioned earlier that when you
prayed to Mother Mary, you it went away.
I mean, are you a religious person? And
and do you think that there is a
religious connection here? Could the
Catholic Church have a point?
>> Well, I mean, I was brought Catholic. I
have always been a Catholic, let's say,
up to my mid20s with a lot of doubts. Uh
but you know I had I I love the the
personal you know the the the
personality of Jesus as somebody you
know uh sort of embracing the this
unconditional love this peace this
whatever but I always felt a
disconnection with the structure the the
the the structure of power created by by
the church. So I don't consider myself
religious but I am very attracted by by
Jesus teachings
even though I also know that there have
been some manipulation on the original
message and for instance the early
Christians believed in in reincarnation
believe in meditation and also in
healing practices and uh all this was
wiped out from the Bible during the
Nyian council uh with with Constantine
the first. So when you talk about
Christianity, one should really go back
and study the the let's say the the the
very ancient text and not this gospel
that we see now, which is a bit the
manipulation, I would say.
>> Well, do you think that what you're
learning through your direct meditation
you believe with some kind of non-human
intelligence?
I mean, could it be what Christianity
and other religions you believe are
trying to suppress?
It's it's some you know there there is a
a very a very like thin line between uh
what people like me are connecting to
and what you know angels or spiritual
entities that have been in contact with
people and they are reported in
religions. So I don't know for sure
there is a level of suppression
um but uh but it's coming out because
people are having these experiences and
they are uh they're sharing them. So
>> as an Italian, do you believe the
Vatican knows a lot more about anomalous
phenomena than it cares to publicly let
on?
Well, I'm not the one that should say
that, but uh yeah, probably
a lot of a lot of people report uh you
know this information and people with
knowledge, not not just me that reads
the the news, you know, or the reports
of others. So,
>> so let's talk about what you're seeing
when you're doing your meditations and
engaging with what you believe is a
non-human intelligence.
When you see these beings, are they
humanoid or are they something else?
>> Well, I have to say in four years I
meditated every day at least once. Uh my
meditations typically are are very very
short like maybe 10 minutes. Sometimes
when it's a group meditation and I did a
lot especially at the beginning can last
also longer maybe an hour or something.
I've seen a lot. I've seen really a lot.
uh some look like uh some uh some of
these Indian gods. Uh some don't have
really a shape. In some case you just
hear them somehow in your own voice. Uh
in in some other cases they they are
nonhuman. Insecttoids for instance or
>> mantis for instance or or also ants. Uh
some other look like humans. Some other
look like uh these gods that you see in
the Egyptian uh uh yellow glyphs like
Anubis like with a or or with a lion
head or with a cat head. And I I mean
I'm not the only one uh having these
experiences. A lot of people in my
circle and I I know really hundreds of
people let's say that have similar
experiences and sometimes see even the
same entity within the same meditation.
So,
>> can I ask you about this, Andrea? I'm
I'm really struck at the moment how all
around the world there are people since
I first talked about it. I talked about
blue beings. And I said it almost on a
whimsy. I I just mentioned casually that
there were people reaching out to me who
who claimed to be in contact with blue
entities. And yet what's fascinating is
I get the impression people all over the
world like dozens of people have
contacted me with stories of being
downloaded with information of given
creative ideas or intellectual notions
uh in some cases incredible scientific
gifts in their mind.
What do you think's going on? I mean
obviously you believe as a child what
you were shown when you were eight years
old that wasn't a coincidence was it? I
mean do you think that phenomenon was
manifesting itself to you specifically?
>> Yes I I I do think so. It was almost
like uh inspiring inspiring me. I mean
uh it's like it shows some sort of
oversight that go beyond time. It's like
I I have to come here and show you
something so that you will later on make
this choice at that specific moment in
your life. And you know,
>> so you're feeling you're feeling guided.
You're you're feeling that the the
purpose in your life is intrinsically
connected to that experience that you
had when you were an 8-year-old kid.
>> If I hadn't had that experience,
probably I wouldn't uh have become an
aerospace engineer. I would I would be
in a completely different path. Uh
>> I am I'm really struck by that. I'm
really struck by how many people I meet
and I talk to who tell me that their
experience with the phenomenon. It's not
just say a UFO. Often it's weird
experiences like you've described
vibrations, you know, being in their bed
and being paralyzed and then having
experiences with what they believe are
entities, beings of some kind. But what
fascinates me is how people seem driven
by a purpose after they've had those
experiences. That's been your experience
clearly.
>> Absolutely. Absolutely. So I know that
there is this narrative about the
threats posed by some of these entities
and I do believe that uh may maybe some
of them are really a threat for us uh or
at least you know controlling and trying
to to manipulate us in some way. But I
also believe that some of them are
absolutely uh positive and benevolent
doing healings inspiring people. And you
just look at history, you just look at
religions, there is always the balance
between angels and demons. They call
them in different ways, but it's always
the same. So there is some sort of evil
force or self-serving to the to the list
and then there is another one which is
benevolent and try to inspire and uh and
do something good. So,
have you encountered evil forces in your
time navigating through these
experiences?
>> Yes. But uh
I've been in situations in which I have
interacted with accidentally let's say
with with some negative entities and uh
the way it manifested for me is with
extreme pain like uh just for me and for
other people I had situations in which I
participated to a meeting and uh it was
like 45 people all with some spiritual
background and there was one person that
didn't show the face and I thought
immediately this person is doing
something and immediately after I felt
sick. My friend felt sick that was in my
room and another friend that
participated in in her own house. She
also felt sick and then I actually
closed my eyes. I meditate and I saw a
dark entity and when I sort of remove it
everybody felt better like my friend had
a pain here it disappeared like like
that.
Now, Andrea, you understand conventional
science, traditional science, mainstream
science, so-called, would dismiss what
you say and say it's not real because
it's it's it's and and yet you are to
some degree quantifying it. You're
measuring it. You're you're detecting
something happening when you are
engaging with this phenomenon. You can
actually see it with the imagery that
you've very kindly shown us.
One of the issues that's fascinating to
me as a journalist is that science
struggles to understand not just the
issue of UFOs, UAPs, flying sauces,
aliens, ETSs. It it struggles to
understand anything anomalous or
paranormal.
And yet
there's a reality there, isn't there?
>> Yes. And the good news is that now we
have some technology which can give us
insight into this. So we cannot maybe
see the entity itself but we can study
the interaction. We can see that if when
somebody's experiencing something there
are some measurable effects. So this is
a you know it's a gamecher in the
discussion. You know one thing is to
just say okay I see something but
another thing is to show something like
I showed with these videos in which you
see a level of energy which is
completely anomalous with with other
people. So there must be something in
there. So or either I am a different
kind of human or there is something in
there. So
>> well there's also the fact that if you
don't look you won't find. And one of
the things that I find really
interesting about a lot of establishment
science is it has an objurate resistance
to even considering the possibility that
the sort of things you're describing are
real, doesn't it? That's why actually
even though I have positions which are a
bit different from from the one of a
loop who is really nuts and bolts kind
of scientist but I really appreciate
what he's doing in in trying to to call
out you know this these mainstream
science and said look if you don't look
you don't find you know if you would put
a fraction of the money that you put in
the in the CERN experiments or in the
SETI program into this
And I can say for instance into into
scanning with MRIs people that that have
experiences or or in in using these
hyperspectal devices or for whatever I
mean you would find a lot of answers. So
and and at the moment a big uh obstacle
for people like me is that public
funding is not available for this kind
of exciting investigations that can
change mankind from one day to another
like in a in a in a way that has never
seen before. So this this sort of uh how
can I say infuriates me the the fact
that we are hostage of these uh of these
uh mindsets and and so the only the only
chance you have to make this kind of
investigations which require a lot of
resources so as I said this this
technology is expensive like a a
hyperspectral camera like that is a
50,000 euro device then you have to
postprocess the data takes you weeks h
so uh if you don't find find funding in
privately, you basically or or you put
the money yourself, then you cannot
advance. And so we are sort of hostage
of the the mainstream position of of
people that uh that you know don't see
the benefit of something that is really
in which there is something to to
investigate.
>> So what's going on though? I mean, do
you think it's just science having
discomfort with something that it can't
immediately quantify or measure,
or is there a more deliberate conspiracy
going on? You know, do do you think
there is some in science who know about
this phenomenon but want to suppress it?
>> I I don't want to enter into into this
territory. What I can say the simplest
explanation is just co cognitive
dissonance. It's like you are brought up
since an early age within a you know you
are you are sort of programmed to think
that reality is only what you can see
with your eyes uh and then you figure
out for instance that you cannot see uh
the the sen that your Wi-Fi is operating
uh but they're there's something you
know there's something physical you can
measure it you cannot see it so you know
you have to go beyond what you can can
see with your senses or or feel with
your senses and explore a little more.
If if I go though through the logical
narrative of what you've described very
kindly in your account to me today,
the implication is that the intelligence
that manifested itself to you when you
were an 8-year-old boy
deliberately seeded you with an
awareness of anomalous phenomena with
the intention of twigging your
consciousness.
And I wonder sometimes whether that's
not being done to a lot of people that
contact me. I I I I get overwhelmed by
people contacting me telling me their
experiences. And I find it very
exciting. I love sharing and hearing
what people are describing to me. And
being, I can tell you, my friend, a
dogged skeptic who's been very resistant
to even considering the possibility that
any of this might be real, what strikes
me is the voluminous quantity of witness
evidence where people are describing
having their awareness of something else
twigged by a major event such as what
you've described. and then they devote
their lives to a particular field of
study or investigation or in some cases
creative arts. You know, they're
painters, they're musicians, and they're
inspired to develop that art. But what
fascinates me is, is it possible that
that what you're describing is some kind
of intelligence that is actually trying
to seed humanity with ideas?
>> Yeah, I I I do think so. And uh it's
possible that uh they try to do it with
everybody but some people just don't
listen you know or uh or dismiss certain
phenomena that you know maybe sometimes
they they saw something and they didn't
devote attention to it and uh it could
have played their role and
>> well what give me an explanation though.
Why wouldn't they be more overt? You
know, if they want us to be aware of the
other realms that we're talking about
here, if they want us to learn how to
meditate and and to learn how to engage
with them, why not be more overt?
>> Well, I think they stick at least the
benevolent one stick to some degree of
non-intervention
and u and so they try to limit as much
as possible. They give breadcrumbs
but in a way that you have to understand
that is a breadcrumb and some people
just don't see it and and they do it
over and over again and the moment you
start understanding what you're looking
at and you start following the
breadcrumbs then they lead you
somewhere.
The implication though behind what
you're talking about is that there must
be this is what you believe as a
scientist. There must be a way of
scientifically explaining the phenomenon
that you're you're describing that that
this encounter perhaps with the divine
or or some other realm that you're
having, it might actually be
scientifically investigable and
measurable. It's just that we're not
looking.
Absolutely. And uh and I think it will
get better and better uh with with these
new technologies. Just think about the
pilots uh they made an upgrade to their
fleer system and suddenly they see
objects all the time. It's you you just
have to look in frequencies and uh and
spectra which are beyond the visible and
you will hear stuff. You will uh see
stuff and and and and so on. I I just
want to also Yeah.
Well, no, please finish what you were
saying because I I do have another
question, but I just want to hear the
rest of what you're saying. I think it's
important.
>> What one of my early experiences, so I
had this healing in my in my ligament
injury. But then a couple of days after
that, I had another phenomena which was
really interesting. Basically, I stopped
meditating and then I hear this sound. I
I was meditating meditating with the
headphones. So, I hear this modulated
sound. It almost sounded like a a
robotic voice, but I don't want to go
that far, but let's say very modulated.
And I said, what what is that? And I
look at my phone, there was absolutely
no app. There was no YouTube, no
nothing. There was absolutely no app
that was working at the moment, but the
sound was coming and it was not just a,
you know, a single sound. It was really
modulated. And then I unplug the
headphones and the sound was still
there. So it was not in the in the
environment and it lasted for some time
maybe a minute or half a minute and then
and then I said wow it almost looks like
some form of communication no and then I
remember that u so in let's say 2000 no
what was it 1992 I joined a rock band I
was the new drummer okay and uh so the
first time we went to the rehearsal room
we decided to record on a brand new
cassette and at the end of the recording
there was a sound which was very much
like this one and at the time we I mean
there was no reason why this sound had
uh been recorded because during the the
the the plane we didn't see anything
strange we didn't hear any strange sound
but then there was this strange sound
for minutes and then we look at each
other and said maybe something
paranormal but maybe it was a spirit I
don't know we don't have any explanation
but Then you know then I made a
connection later on. I said well this
sound reminds me of something. Oh yeah
it happened in 1992. It is very similar.
I don't know I don't know the logic of
this but you know I see a connection.
>> But but more importantly what fascinates
me about you Dr. for Andrea Alani is you
are motivated, more motivated than most
scientists to investigate this phenomena
because of those experiences you've had.
You're convinced they're real. And you
feel, and I I admire you for this, you
feel an obligation to talk about it
publicly, even though you risk a high
degree of stigma and ridicule for doing
so.
>> Yes. I have to say I'm also lucky
because uh I know that there is people
who are having these experiences and
they are sort of alone. They don't talk
to friends or or family or whatever.
they try to leave their experience by
themsel but I have a circle of of people
that I know also scientists and
engineers and whatever who are having
all kind of experiences and so I'm not
alone and there are there is a lot of
people out there that is like me wants
answers and the only way to to find
answers is to to to seek them so
one of the things you've talked about
you hinted about this earlier was these
weird synchronicities where you've been
told to go to various places or to see
certain things. What's the weirdest
anomalous phenomena experience that
you've had?
>> Um,
well, I can mention the the the case of
the cat that got trapped into into my
house. So, basically, uh this was on the
21st June 2020. I did a meditation in a
in a park nearby with seven friends. all
all women and uh during this meditation
one of these friend went into a trans
channeling state. So she was taken over
by some entity, some entities actually
that spoke through her. They were
speaking a little bit in English and a
little bit in some other language that
we couldn't understand. And uh but in
the meantime we were al also feeling
energies something very physical and um
this lasted for about 25 minutes. I was
I myself was completely drained. I
couldn't move after that. The energies
that I felt were something that I never
felt before. Uh then I took a walk after
a while and said, "Okay, let's try it
again. This looks like fun and we
reconnected and the same thing happened
again and especially
uh I have the audio but it's something
that I wouldn't share for the moment but
uh these entities had something to say
to me particularly through this person
who was channeling. So what happened is
I went home and um I found my neighbor
in front of the of the of the door. I
never had any interaction with this
neighbor and she said, "Well, somebody
from the house in front of yours saw my
cat entering your house from the
window." I had a window open uh very
slanted or something. The cat somehow
seemed to have managed to enter. So we
enter the house. I said, "Okay, let's
look for him." So we go room by room. We
close the door. We go in the basement.
She was screaming the name of the cat.
The cat is nowhere to be found. I say,
"Sorry, maybe your your friend, you
know, didn't see correctly." And then
three days later, so for three days, I
had no sign whatsoever of life from from
a cat. Like, you know, there was nothing
wrong. I couldn't find anything around.
And sometimes I was going to to rooms
again and close the room the the door
and check everywhere. But, you know, I
had little furniture. This was a big
cat. It was impossible for a cat like
that not to be found in three days.
Okay. But so at the time I was
meditating and the message I was
receiving is this cat has been sent to
your house and remember the cat entered
the the house when we were having this
experience in the park to give you a
evidence of the nonlinearity of time
which is a very strange message. And uh
I had a friend in Italy uh this guy is a
photo reporter and he's also a medium
trained also in shamanic stuff raiki
teta healing whatever and he was giving
me a message like yeah it's almost like
the cat is stuck in between worlds
and uh so the fourth day finally I find
some uh some poo let's say upstairs and
then a ripped off trash bag in
downstairs. So, and the door was closed
between the two. So, I don't know how he
managed to to do that, but it's
something else to to be investigated,
but um so I put um I put my laptop to
record during the night to try to catch
the cat. I put some some food and then
after 56 minutes in the video, which is
9 hours, 18 minutes, 18 seconds, the cat
enters the room, jump on the sofa, and
then for six minutes, the video freezes.
And then after that the video
accelerates 100 times. So you have to
accelerate to to let's say uh slow down
100 times to see one single frame in
which you see the cat in the middle of
the room and then it disappears and then
it comes back in the room. And uh I've
shown this video to a lot of people
physicists and stuff and they all got
very interested. This could be the
famous you know some people talk about
the the shinger cat.
>> The Schroinger cat. I was about to say
Schrodinger's cat. Yeah,
>> this could be a variation. Let's say
some sort of quantum cat in which uh you
know the observer was uh was the the the
laptop and he observed something very
weird. And then if you think about it,
you saw first the video freezes. So it's
almost like time freezes, then it
accelerates. So time accelerates and
then it goes back to normal. So it slow
down. So it was consistent with the
message that I received for I mean three
three days before. And I I I would have
never thought I could catch something
like that on on on camera.
>> Dr. Andrea Lani, I have to say your your
views are provocative but very
thoughtprovoking and I I must confess uh
hearing your cander is what I respect
and admire most. It's it's not often
that a scientist who's worked with NASA,
somebody who's worked in astrophysics
and mechanical engineering at such a
high level is prepared to talk about the
limitations of science in describing
anomalous phenomena. Maybe one day you
might be the guy that provides us with
the breakthrough that helps us
understand what's really going on.
>> Yeah. I don't know. It's not important.
It's me. It's important that you know uh
science engage and and there are
attempts you know by by Gary Holland by
by Ailoo by you know a lot of the people
that uh that also you know so something
is changing and uh with if we get some
public funding for research it will
change even faster. Well, just in
closing, do you think that the
phenomenon is being more overt that it's
trying to let us know it's there?
Yeah, it really looks like you you
really see some sort of momentum
growing. It's uh my my my vision is that
I see this snowball that is rolling down
and there is no way to stop it at this
point. So,
>> well, sir, I certainly hope you're
right. It' be great to get some answers.
Dr. Andrea Lani, thank you so much for
sharing your stories with Reality Check
and I sincerely hope that one day you
get those scientific answers that you so
obviously crave.
>> Thank you very much. It was a very, very
nice conversation.
