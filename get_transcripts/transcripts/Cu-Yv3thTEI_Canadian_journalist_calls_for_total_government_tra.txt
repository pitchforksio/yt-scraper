Good day and welcome back to Reality
Check. So this week we've got a good
friend of mine and a good friend of the
show, Daniel Otus, who's an
investigative journalist based in
Toronto, Canada, who contributes to CTV
News, one of Canada's equivalents, if
you like, of CNN. Daniel's been covering
UFOs for many, many years, and he's
probably one of Canada's foremost
journalists investigating the subject.
And the reason I want to pull him in
today is because of the so-called Sky
Canada report. Back in 2022, I think
Canada announced to everyone's surprise
that it was going to investigate UFOs,
UAPs, unidentified anomalous phenomena.
And the report came down in June this
year. Dan, I'm really keen to hear from
you, sir. Do you think the report said
anything substantial? What's
significant? Or was it a fizzer?
Well, I you know, I think there were
some people hoping that the report would
look into cases and the larger questions
around UAP. It didn't do that. Um, it
set out its goals were to look at how
UAP reports are collected officially in
Canada and to offer recommendations for
improvements if if needed. Well, they
certainly found uh some recommendations
for improvements. And basically what
this report is saying is that you know
UAP data collection needs to be
standardized in Canada and that there
should be a federal body tasked with
investigating these sorts of cases. Um
right now there's a sort of patchwork of
procedures uh that captures UFO reports
uh through transportation officials,
military, air force, what have you. But,
you know, generally speaking, unless
there's a clear national security,
defense, or safety nexus, there tends to
be no follow-up. What the Sky Canada
project is saying is that, you know,
reports of this nature are worthy of
further scientific study and that the
only way we're going to be able to find
answers and get explanations is if we
have better data sets, which could
happen through, you know, the
standardization of reporting mechanisms
and proper scientific analysis.
>> Now, this is very significant. This is
the chief science advisor of Canada for
the Canadian government acknowledging
that unidentified anomalous phenomena
needs to be investigated and data
collected on it. That in and of itself
is very significant, isn't it?
>> Well, I'd say so. Uh, the chief science
adviser of Canada is, you know, reports
directly to the prime minister and and
to the cabinet. It's an armslength
advisory office that you know takes on
projects on its own initiative. I mean
in the past it's looked at co 19. It's
looked at aquaculture. It's looked at
questions of open science and you know I
guess seeing the news that was coming
out of the United States members of this
office uh their their interest was uh
certainly developed out of that and they
decided to they decided to dive headlong
into it. Um were you were you consulted?
Were you were you one of the people that
was consulted as part of their
investigations?
>> Yeah, absolutely. Uh the final report
that was released this summer included a
paragraph on my contributions to the
field. Uh my journalistic work on this
has unveiled procedural material cases
uh shown how you know UAP reports
continue to come in from particularly
credible observers like pilots and
police officers and how you know there
are documents that I've been able to you
know pull through the freedom of
information system showing you know how
these things are cataloged. Uh I I was
consulted um my work was cited in the
report. I've spoken to members of of the
team at the uh Sky Canada project and
yeah and they also spoke to other folks.
I mean they spoke to Arrow. They spoke
to the Guipan UFO group in France. They
they spoke to to a lot of folks and put
out a pretty interesting report.
>> Why have they done this? I mean, it
would have been so easy for them to do
what, for example, the Australian
government continues to do, which is to
stick its head in the sand and deny that
there's an issue at all. Basically say,
"Look, we're not interested in UFOs. We
don't recognize there's any need to
investigate them. We've got other
priorities." Why, at a time when I know
your respective governments and time
have basically been criticized for
spending too much money on follyies, why
are they spending money on investigating
UAPs?
Well, I think they saw the developments
happening south of the border, uh, the
ongoing Pentagon efforts to look into
the UAP issue, NASA, some of the
academic endeavors we're seeing out of
the United States. And I think it
demonstrated to them that you know there
clearly is interest here that you know
reports of this nature do continue to
come in that we don't have explanations
and that anything you know sort of
unknown or unexplained should be looked
at through a scientific lens. I think
it's it's very important to note as I
did before that this is an armslength
scientific advisory office. I mean, had
they, you know, not been in arms length
office, who knows if they would have
been given the liberty to pursue a topic
of this nature. But, but they did so
rather boldly at a time when, you know,
there isn't a lot of political capital
in discussing this issue. We talk about
putting money into things like this when
we have so many other economic problems
in our world. But I think it it really
demonstrated a lot of courage and
forward thinking and willingness to
tackle this issue seriously.
>> I I agree with you there. I mean it is I
mean to me it's quite extraordinary that
they've decided to recommend the
creation if you like of a a federal body
that would be responsible for collecting
and investigating UAPs. Has there been
any progress from the Canadian
government on just how they're going to
create such a body and who's going to do
it? It
>> it's hard to say. Um, the Sky Canada
project report specifically singles out
the Canadian Space Agency as being, you
know, a trusted scientific body that
could undertake this effort. Um, and my
communications with the Canadian Space
Agency, at least their communications
team, the way they paint it, they don't
really want to get involved with the
issue. We did, however, get a pretty um,
supportive response from the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, which is our
federal police force here in Canada.
they expressed willingness uh into
supporting this project and cooperating
with the Sky Canada project because it's
you know in most of Canada the RCMP the
federal police are going to be your
first point of contact if you want to
report something unusual in the sky they
got a lot of reports like this and they
would love for there to be a scientific
body that could look in them to free
them up to do their you know policing
work
>> so the police have actually said that to
you have they the Mounties want some
kind of investigative agency
>> the Mounties have come forward and
supporting this issue. And if you look,
you know, even in the historical record,
the Mounties have been receiving reports
of this nature from concerned Canadian
citizens for decades, decades upon
decades upon decades.
So let's just go back a bit because one
of the things about Canada that
intrigues me is for a while there you
had a member of parliament I think his
name was Larry Maguire and he raised
interesting concerns in a letter that
was directed I think to the defense
minister of Canada suggesting that there
had been historical Canadian military
collaboration with the US on UAP crash
retrieval. s um they were very broad
inquiries that he made to the Canadian
defense minister, but essentially a
denial came back from the minister's
office that the DRDC, the Defense
Research and Development Canada
organization was doing any current work
on UAP.
And I have a hunch that that response
from the Canadian defense minister was a
little evasive that essentially they
confined their answer not to a broad
denial of any Canadian government
scientific investigation and
collaboration with the US, but that they
constrained their answer back to MP
Larry Maguire at the time to the DRDC,
to this Defense Research and Development
Canada organization.
Did the Sky Canada inquiry at any stage
investigate any of the allegations made
by Larry Maguire? And what do you know
about these claims that were made by
Larry Maguire? He seemed to have inside
information.
Yeah. Well, I guess let's to start um
with the Sky Canada project. I mean the
report they released does not touch upon
this issue. Uh as I stated before you
know their real mission was just to look
at the current state of procedures and
to you know offer improvements. They
didn't look at these types of
allegations. Although I'm sure members
of the team have looked into this issue
it fell outside of the scope of their
report. I mean, with the right political
support and the right political will,
the report that we see could perhaps be
chapter one in an ongoing effort, but
you know, we'll need a little bit of
political buyin to make that happen. As
for this letter from Mr. Maguire, um I
mean, uh Larry Magcguire is a member or
was a member of parliament from southern
Manitoba in the Canadian prairies. He
didn't stand for reelection in the
election we have this year. So he's just
retired after uh a long career in in
public office. Uh he's probably one of
the most significant Canadian
politicians when it comes to this issue
uh in in so far of his advocacy. I mean
he was advocating for the Sky Canada
project before it was even officially
launched. And yes, in his letter to uh
the former defense minister, he asked
about, you know, alleged Canadian nexus
and crash retrievals and reverse
engineering in that matter. Uh the
response that came from the Department
of Defense, yeah, was evasive. Uh as far
as I'm aware, you know, Maguire was
basing his questions off material that
was presented to them by a source. As
for corroborating evidence, you know,
it's certainly been a hole I I've tried
diving into, but it's um it's non-stop
deadends. You know, the day I have a a
document in hand or a witness willing to
go on the record about, you know,
Canadian Nexus and these sorts of
allegations, I will certainly run with
the story. But, you know, it's been it's
been a couple years of hard digging
without without finding that conclusive
answer. So, as I understand it, there
were meetings between Larry Maguire's
office and a whistleblower source from
inside the scientific establishment in
the Canadian military. Was that the
allegation you heard?
>> That's my understanding. Uh I I I don't
think Mr. Maguire pulled these
allegations out of thin air. Um,
the way it was presented to me by by his
office is that they were speaking to a
an individual that they deemed credible
who was making allegations of this
nature about Canada's historical
involvement uh perhaps during the Cold
War era. Uh, but again, this person
hasn't uh wanted to come forward in a a
public way as far as I know. Uh, and if
they're out there listening, you know,
they should give you or me a call and
and come on the show because
I'd love to hear from them.
>> I mean, I I've heard a whole lot of
rumors and it's speculation only. I
mean, I've heard from people in the
program, so-called, which is essentially
the secret covert US program that
everybody denies exists, which is
essentially retrieving and attempting to
reverse engineer technology. And there
is one source and I would never uh use
that source because I have to protect
them but they've told me that there has
been and the word is has been
collaboration between Canadian military
scientists and American scientists on
certain technology. It was even
suggested to me that there might be
technology which is located in Canada.
Have you heard similar allegations?
>> I I I've certainly heard things of a
similar nature. Um, you know, I I pull
every thread that presents itself to me,
but I I I have nothing conclusive to say
on that one. You know, I I hope I I can
come back and tell you more about that.
Um,
>> I just for our audience to understand,
Daniel and I are both journalists who
are trained to read press releases
backwards. We're trained to read between
the lines. And in the answer that came
from the uh former Canadian defense
minister when she was the Canadian
defense minister to the question posed
by Larry Maguire, it was very
interesting that Larry had phrased his
question specifically about defense
department involvement with the American
military on crash tech, i.e. UAP
technology, nonhuman technology. And
what's interesting was that the minister
confined her answer very specifically to
this DRDC organization. And I think that
was perhaps a fault with Larry that he
was a bit too sure of himself and he
focused his inquiry on the DRDC
specifically which gave the minister an
opportunity to specifically deny DRDC
involvement. It raises the possibility I
I think likelihood that there have
historically been Canadian scientists
that are perhaps not part of that
so-called DRDC who have and were
involved in collaboration with US
scientists on alleged retrieved
non-human technology.
Well, the the DRDC, you know, as it
exists now would be if there was any
sort of scientific analysis happening
within the Canadian military, that would
be the obvious place where you would
find that kind of work happening. Um I
interesting you say that's former
defense minister Anita Nand who now is
our um our foreign minister, so who's
dealing directly with uh the the Trump
administration as well as other
governments. Uh, so this is a very
prominent individual. I I I really wish
I had more to I could share or tell you
on this, but for me it's been, you know,
I guess it's very similar to what you're
hearing, but it it's been
>> uh difficult to find any kind of
corroborating evidence on this one. It's
it's not something I've given up on,
though. Um,
>> no, absolutely. I'm with I'm with you. I
want to get to the bottom of it. The
other thing I wanted to to ask you
about, Daniel, was
>> there was a memo. I'm not sure if it was
you that obtained it, but there was an
FOI memo that was provided to the prime
minister at the time, Mr. Trudeau, which
briefed that quote, "Full exploitation
of the Alaska object was still ongoing."
And uh a later statement from the
Canadian military clarified that the
memo was stating that the object had not
been yet been found, which is not
actually what the memo says. They
referred to it as object number 23.
Object 23's function, method of
propulsion, or affiliation to any nation
state remains unverified. It is unknown
whether it poses an armed threat or has
intelligence collection capabilities.
The full exploitation of UAP 20, which
was engaged by the US on February the
10th, 2023, has not yet been completed.
And just to make things clear, UAP23
is the one that was um tracked over
Yukon entering Canadian airspace. And
this is some of the I think four mystery
objects that flew across the United
States. Only one of which has formally
been confirmed is an alleged Chinese
government balloon. One of these
objects, of course, fell in the Yukon. I
thought it was interesting, that memo.
What's your takeaway from that memo? Do
do we assume that there's something to
this? What did they mean about full
exploitation of the Alaska object? Did
you ever get to the bottom of that? Oh,
it's hard to say. If you look at the
date of the memo, uh this was that that
was a story that I broke for CTV News uh
revealing this memo. If I recall
correctly, I think it was provided by a
reader who was doing their own uh
freedom of information work if I recall
correctly. Um, as as for the full
exploitation, yeah, it certainly the
word full exploitation implies that, you
know, they're actively in the midst of
exploiting or analyzing something. Uh,
what what strikes me about these cases,
you know, we had the object that was
shot down Alaska, uh, Canada's Yukon
Territory, which borders Alaska, and
then one over Lake Hiron in the Great
Lakes.
Nothing, no information came out. We
heard a lot about you know this uh this
Chinese spy balloon you know which we
had clear as day photos but in terms of
the other objects we were we were given
nothing. Uh my my work has found some
more details. For example uh the work I
did found images that were taken of the
Yukon object. Uh emails about those
images revealed that they were stills
from video. I tried to obtain that video
and was denied, but we at least got the
images. Other Freedom of Information
work has revealed that the RCMP, the
Mounties, recovered debris from the
shores of Lake Hiron. Uh that
information was never made public for
whatever reason. As for the Alaska
object, it's it's even less less has
come through. And um you know the the
debris that was collected from Lake
Hiron
according to the internal analysis and
the documents I was able to find made it
pretty clear that it was perhaps some
sort of smaller weather balloon type
device. Okay. But why all the secrecy?
And and if our militaries and
governments are willing to be so
intensely secret about something that
has a pretty ordinary explanation, I
mean, what are what are they willing to
uh lie and mislead about? Um
>> well cuz the reason I I really wanted
you to make that point is because the
findings in this quite I think excellent
report from Sky Canada are that in order
to avoid conspiracy theories in order to
diffuse public speculation that there's
something sinister going on with these
objects it's very important to be
transparent. And what shocks me is that
we are now what two three years on now
from those February 2023 overflights
that became a massive media issue in not
only Canada but the United States and
the rest of the world. It was a huge
concern that there had been these
overflights of the continental United
States, North America. And we still
don't have answers to that mystery.
Isn't that in and of itself a spit in
the eye to the claims that are made in
the Sky Canada report about the
importance of transparency and
accountability?
>> Well, that's that's exactly it. I mean,
a lack of transparency certainly has
fueled all kinds of theories about these
objects, you know, and if my reporting
sheds light on perhaps, you know, how
ordinary at least, you know, we one of
these things was, why why all the
secrecy? Is it a case of, you know,
they're embarrassed for overreacting?
Possible. Is it a case of them wanting
to cover something up? Yes, also
possible. It's it's frustrating, you
know. I I find it not only as a
journalist, but as a a citizen of Canada
that we had these incidents that
dominated headlines and generated a
great deal of public curiosity and you
know, our governments and military
officials don't have the fundamental
respect for the populace to provide them
with the answers that they do have when
they do have them. It's interesting
because in the Sky Canada report they
actually specifically address I noticed
the overflying four objects and they
acknowledge um that that one of them was
of course shot down over the US
territorial waters off the coast of
South Carolina and it was identified as
originating from a foreign country and
carried sophisticated equipment. I think
that's the Canadians not wanting to
offend China. But it also acknowledged
that one week later on February the
11th, 2023, the North American Aerospace
Defense Command, NORAD, ordered the
downing of a smaller balloon over Yukon
Territory, Canadian territory. Two other
small high alitude balloons, it says,
was shot down over US airspace. One in
northern Alaska February the 10th and
the second over Lake Huron on February
the 12th. And apparently there was a
brief statement by an RCMP, a Mounty
spokesperson to CTV News. The recovered
debris from the shores of Lake Huron
were deemed not to be of national
security concern. If it really is the
case that these were, as they say, high
alitude balloons, small high alitude
balloons, why the secrecy?
As I said, I mean, embarrassment for
using a very expensive missile to down
something, you know, that cost a few
hundred bucks perhaps. The desire to
cover up something. The It's the secrecy
to me seems unnecessary. I mean, I I'm a
proponent for radical transparency from
our governments. Um, you know, that's
part of what drew me as a journalist
into looking at the UFO UAP issue. I
mean, I I write about all kinds of
things. I do investigations on other
subjects, too. Uh, but this one, it it
was just so striking to me that we have
this history of governments essentially
not respecting the public's ability to
digest this kind of information. Um,
decades of obiscation, you know, decades
of denials. Um, so to me, this sort of
seemed like a continuation of that. you
know, now the Sky Canada project is
coming out and saying we need to end
this kind of secrecy uh in order to
regain public trust. And when it comes
specifically the UFO issue shows you uh
how how public trust can be and
governments can be eroded. Um you know,
it's it's clear as day that folks are
seeing things they can't explain. uh yet
it's only just in the past few years
after decades that we're we're finally
getting you know some degree of support
from governments publicly saying that
you know this is a real issue worth
looking into. Now just returning for a
moment to the speculation that was made
by Larry Maguire MP when he was an MP to
the Canadian defense minister that there
might be Canadian scientists who had
historically involved themselves in
collaborating with the US on retrieved
nonhuman alien technology. Incredible
allegation. What's fascinating to me is
that there is an on thereord public
history in Canada involving a gentleman
called Wilbert Smith who was um an
engineer with the Department of
Transport in Canada in the 1950s and he
asked for permission to do part-time
research to investigate whether some
UFOs could use the power of Earth's
magnetic field as a source of
propulsion. They talk about Project
Magnet in the Sky Canada report and how
Smith essentially um expanded its
investigative scope to include
investigations into the validity of UFO
observations. What's interesting is
they they represent that Smith's work
was private work and yet it's quite
clear from what Wilbert Smith said
during his lifetime that he was liazing
very closely with very senior people in
what seems to have been some kind of
precursor of what we now know of as the
the legacy UAP crash retrieval reverse
engineering program. He said he was
briefed about the secret UAP program by
people scientists in the United States,
that the contacts that he made were
facilitated by, I think, the Canadian
consulate or the Can Canadian embassy in
Washington DC. And that he was told that
this was a secret that was higher even
than the hydrogen bomb. Uh, what do you
know about the Wilbert Smith story? Was
he just an eccentric Canadian engineer
who did these investigations on his own
bat? Or do you think that there was some
kind of collaboration going on between
Wilbert Smith and scientists or
officials in the US military?
>> I think probably a little bit of both um
is my sense of it. He he started looking
into this in an official capacity and
once the powers that be got a whiff of
what he was up to, uh his official
investigations were ended, but that
didn't stop him from continuing to dig.
>> And good on him for doing so.
>> Absolutely. I mean, like it appears he
did make contacts, you know, with in the
United States. Um
it, you know, I I'll I'll be frank with
you. I'll be honest. My my research has
mostly focused on contemporary cases and
procedures. Um I work as a journalist
and if you find documents from, you
know, 70 years ago, uh most new editor
news editors aren't going to get excited
about that. You know, they want to see
the Royal Canadian Air Force procedures
that are on the books today in 2025. Um,
so I I I'm not I'm not an expert on on
Wilbert Smith, but it it is as we as far
as we can tell the earliest official
Canadian investigatory effort into the
issue. You know, he took it very
seriously. Uh he claims to have been
told information that uh you know is
echoed in that letter Larry Maguire uh
wrote to the former defense minister. Um
there there's to me it seems there's
threads to pull there and there's still
threads to pull there. Um the Wilbert
Smith papers uh create a lot of
questions that we we still don't have
conclusive answers for.
>> Let's talk about some of those
contemporary cases that you're aware of.
One of the um people I I think we should
probably tip our hat to on the way
through here is um is it Chris Rutoski?
Chris Rutowski. He um he's ran run a
civilian organization for many years
inside Canada which essentially had been
I think even the referring point by
police and other government agencies.
You actually had an extraordinary
situation where a private UFO data
gathering organization led by Mr.
Rkowski was essentially gathering all of
the data on UAPs in that part of North
America. um what what what do you know
about some of the more recent
contemporary UAP reports and have they
played any part in prompting the the
Canadian government to start taking this
issue more seriously?
>> Yeah. Well, just to to backtrack a
little bit about uh Chris Rowski, he's a
researcher out of uh Winnipeg, uh
Manitoba, and he he's done some
interesting work. his uh group has been
collecting and collating uh Canadian
reports for decades and for a period of
almost 20 years he was receiving some
reports directly from Canadian uh
transportation and military officials
which he was using in his you know
survey that he publishes every year. Um
in terms of contemporary reports, my
research shows that you know in very
very recent years we have uh pilots on
airlines like United, American Airlines,
uh Air Canada, WestJet, Air France, KLM.
I could I could go on and on. Uh
reporting unusual lights and objects
over Canadian skies. Uh my research has
uncovered air traffic control audio
where you can hear pilots describing
these kinds of lights in real time and
their you know sense of awe and wonder.
Um I think there's specifically there's
a few specific cases. You know when you
ask the Canadian government what do we
do about what do you do about UFO
reports? The line you get back generally
says uh we do not you know investigate
or follow up unless there is a safety uh
you know or security issue and there
have been cases where there has been a
safety and security issue and they did
follow up you know for example there was
a case I found uh
oh I'm trying to remember the year it's
it's from the 2000s where it involved an
American Airlines flight seeing an
unusual light to uh off the Atlantic
coast of Canada. Two other flights also
see the same light. The Canadian Air
Force scrambles uh CF-18 fighter jets to
investigate. They don't see anything.
They return home. There's other cases
where NORAD radar uh see detects a
fastmoving object coming in from over
the Arctic. Fighter jets are scrambled.
Again, oftentimes the reports show they
don't see anything. There's another one
right here in Toronto where a Porter
Airlines flight approaching uh the
downtown Toronto Island airport coming
in from Ottawa. It's cruising in over
Lake Ontario and suddenly there is a
donut-shaped object in its path right in
front of it. The plane takes a bit of a
nose dive avasive action to avoid
hitting this object. And because the
flight attendants weren't wearing their
seat belts at the time, they were thrown
into the cabin structure and they ended
up getting sent to the hospital and the
workplace injuries
created
a safety investigation. And there's
literally hundreds of pages of documents
and emails of them trying to get to the
bottom of this case. I believe that one
was 2016. So there are cases that
>> did they get to the bottom of that one?
I mean, that one sounds intriguing. what
was the finding of the cause of the
actual accident?
>> The the they ultimately determined, you
know, the official line that they ended
up telling me and other members of the
media was that the description of the
object did not match any known
commercially available drone. The
internal emails I reviewed showed some
degree of speculation that perhaps it
was an experimental drone that drifted
from a military base in upstate New
York. Uh they were floating around
images of a sort of donut fil like
object uh that would have been filled
with helium with a rotor in it. They
said that kind of looked like it. Um
I've actually in this case I I wrote
about it and afterwards the pilot
reached out to me. um to discuss it and
and he said there there was you know I'm
not going to go into details it was an
off thereord conversation but I I can
tell you that he was never given a
conclusive answer about what he saw
there thought maybe it could have been
you know some kind of military drone but
it was all may there there was no
conclusive answer they decided to end
the investigation without determining
what it was the flight attendants only
had minor injuries they were released
from hospital and that was that was the
end of
But the thing that really shocks me all
the time about both the way the US,
Canada, and indeed Australia handle
these reports is they often say there is
no issue of national security posed by
these UAP events. But it's becoming more
and more implausible that assertion.
It's certainly not only a national
security incident that something is is
breaching airspace without being
identified. It's a flight safety issue
as well. Well, I mean, by any measure,
what you're describing there is an acute
flight safety issue. People were injured
because of an unknown object in the sky
that they had to avoid.
Huge flight safety issue. Absolutely. Uh
national security. I I see that I I
always, you know, I've said this before,
I worry about the national security
lens. I I was really happy about the Sky
Canada project because of its scientific
focus. Um, when I talk to journalists in
the United States who research this
issue, they have a really hard time
accessing data. When you're, you know,
your national organizations,
defense officials are looking at this
seriously as a defense issue, suddenly
the everything can be withheld through
freedom of information. Like I I've had
a great deal of success pulling reports
and cases in Canada precisely because it
hasn't been viewed as a national
security issue here. You know, had our
military officials uh operated under
that lens, I probably would have only
have received a fraction of the data I
have thus far. Uh the journalists I
talked to in the United States, they can
get, you know, officials to talk to them
about UAPs much easier than we can in
Canada, but but the data it becomes so
scarce. Um, but the the incidents, the
shootown incidents, you know, show yeah,
there's a national security nexus. Uh, I
I'm very but I'm very pleased and uh and
supportive of the angle that the Sky
Canada project took uh you know
specifically that there is a scientific
issue here that needs answering.
>> But is anything going to is is anything
going to happen, Daniel? I mean, by the
sounds of it, it's now stuck in the in
the bureaucracy. You you you've said
that the Space Agency of Canada doesn't
want it on their desk. The Monties are
obviously keen for it to happen. Uh is
there any political impetus or is it
just going to sit on a shelf and gather
dust in the office of the chief
scientist?
>> Well, that that's that's the real issue
here, you know, with uh Larry Maguire
retiring from politics. We no longer
have a political public-f facing
champion like that in Canada. We don't
have anyone in parliament. I mean, you
you look at the US, you have multiple
members of Senate and Congress who are
willing to keep hammering this issue. Uh
in Canada with Maguire's retiring, we
don't have anyone, I guess, willing to
do so publicly. Uh I've had
conversations that certainly show that
there are members of parliament who are
interested in the issue, but we don't
seem to have anyone as quite as willing
as Mr. Larry Magcguire quite as willing
to stick their neck out and become a
champion of the cause. And I think
without that kind of political support,
I'm I'm afraid this could be dead in the
water. We have a brand new government in
Canada. They're hyper fixated on a lot
of the economic challenges posed uh by
uh the Trump administration and its
dealings with Canada. And for them to
invest time and money into something of
this nature does not seem very probable
at this point in time.
>> It's interesting,
>> but you know, I'd love to be proven
wrong. Um,
>> it's interesting that you speculated
that the donut shaped object that the
plane tried to avoid might have come
from an upstate New York US military
base because of course the other thing
that's been going on in this period is
the uh I think they started around
October, November last year, the
overflights of parts of continental
North America by what the government of
the United States has euphemistically
deemed drones. I don't know if that's an
appropriate term, but were the drone
sightings I've had messages from people
in Canada, notably in Toronto, who've
sent me videos and photographs of weird
looking objects that that frankly look
like aircraft, but are moving so
pathetically slowly. In some cases,
they're stationary. Um, they're not. Uh,
have you had the same drone socalled
alerts in um your part of North America?
>> We I don't think we've had the kind of
mass sightings that, you know, we were
seeing on the northeast in the United
States. But yeah, listen, I I I get
emails, multiple emails a week from
Canadians seeing things like this, you
know, in Toronto, in way out in the
middle of, you know, in small towns, in
this middle of nowhere, in big cities. I
mean, in the country, in the urban
settings, people are seeing things. Um,
you know, one other thing I I'd like to
bring up about that uh that sighting
over Lake Ontario is that we also have
um two significant nuclear power plants
just outside of Toronto on the shores of
Lake Ontario. Um I I want to bring this,
you know, we talk about government
transparency. I'm in a multi-year battle
now to try and get uh security reports
on UFO sightings from these nuclear
power plants released. Um they have been
denying They they're refusing to release
them about it.
>> They refused to release them. Uh this
was a I'm trying to I think I first
filed my request in 2022 if I'm not
mistaken. Uh they refused to release
them. I filed a complaint. Uh we went
through mediation. They continued to
refuse to release them. And then in
addition to refusing to release them,
they uh hired outside counsel to create
a legal justification that stated that
they are, you know, a provincial crown
corporation. So, a provincial
governmental corporation runs these
nuclear power plants. And what they're
trying to argue now is that by following
the provincial freedom of information
legislation, they would therefore be in
violation of their federal nuclear
security obligations. And yet and yet
and yet we have this Sky Canada report
saying that one of the things that is
most essential is for the public to be
discouraged from developing conspiracy
theories by being the government being
as open as possible about everything
that it knows on the subject of UAPs.
It's a total contradiction, isn't it?
>> But this isn't even just not being
transparent. This is putting taxpayer
money into fighting transparency. Uh
thankfully I was able to find a a lawyer
uh Josh Das uh with the Canadian
Constitution Foundation who's taking on
this case pro bono and you know the the
Ontario power generation the the folks
that operate this nuclear power plant
were really trying to drown me in legal
ease and you mentioned because there is
a nexus isn't there between nuclear
plants nuclear power facilities and UAP
sightings. Have you had anecdotal
reports that that have led to you asking
for these FOI reports?
>> Absolutely. Yeah, for sure.
>> Multiple
>> I I've had people reach out um not folks
willing necessarily willing to go on the
record and describe their stories, but I
I I heard enough echoes of this that it
prompted me to file these requests. They
denied them. I immediately asked if
records were, you know, identified. They
said yes. And hence now I'm in this
multi-year uh legal wrangling. Um yeah,
we we hear that in the United States. We
hear that in other countries that you
know there have been interesting and
significant sightings in and around
nuclear facilities or nuclear weapon
facilities. I very much want to see if
that's the case in Canada. Uh but they
are fighting me tooth and nail uh when
it comes to getting these reports.
>> Why do you think that is Daniel? I mean
obviously there's a tendency I think for
all of us to default to a conspiracy
theory that they're trying to hide
something. Um do you think there's a
there's a good reason why they're trying
to conceal this information?
>> I'm a little biased here.
I I think they they don't have no good
reason. They don't want to deal with it.
um
you know their argument is that
releasing these security reports reveal
vulnerabilities
uh in their defenses. I've, you know, as
I've actually toured some of the I've
toured one of these nuclear power plants
uh for an unrelated story and yeah,
they're, you know, you have guys with um
assault rifles and high levels of
security, but my arguments has always
been okay um release the reports, redact
everything that could, you know, that
could violate your security or make you
folks vulnerable and provide me with the
descriptions of, you know, these objects
or lights themselves. but they they
don't want to do that.
>> I I think it's wonderful that you're
getting proono legal assistance. Could
you just name again the lawyer that's
doing this good work on your behalf?
>> Uh his name is Josh Das with the
Canadian Constitution Foundation. Uh
Josh is a a former journalist. Actually,
we met as journalists. Uh he left
journalism to pursue a law career. And
uh when this fight started heating up, I
I I reached out to him and he just
happened to be uh working with a a legal
organization that you know takes on
cases uh you know in terms of that deal
with free speech or transparency and
government secrecy.
>> Good on good on him for doing that. I I
also think it's it's important too that
that one of the other things that came
through to me from the Sky Canada report
that I thought was really interesting
was that not only do Canadians report
somewhere between 600 to a,000 UAP
sightings annually, they did a survey
for Sky Canada and the surveys results
are actually quite profound.
One in four respondents said that they
had personally witnessed a UAP in their
lifetime. A quarter of respondents said
they'd seen a UAP, but only 10% reported
their sightings. And 40% of respondents
wouldn't know whom to report their
sightings to anyway. And interestingly,
a majority of the respondents supported
the idea of creating a federal
government service to gather UAP reports
and to make those findings publicly
available. So, you really do have public
opinion on your side, Daniel.
>> Uh, absolutely. Um, and you know, when I
when I saw that, that that was
interesting that they hired a they
commissioned an outside consulting
company to do this work. Um, you know, I
I would be one of those people. Many
years ago, I saw some odd moving lights
in the sky. And I didn't, you know, I'm
like, "Huh, that's interesting." I
didn't think anything of it. Didn't
report it to anybody. And, you know, you
get a group of people together or start
asking people questions in a bar, you
usually hear similar stories from
people. Um, people see things and they,
you know, most people don't want to
stick their necks out. Um, and in my
case, one, you know, I saw something
weird like that as a kid. It was with my
brother. We saw it. Wow. And we both
remember it to this day, but you know,
most people just don't report. It's just
something that happens and they scratch
their head and go on with their lives.
Hopefully. Hopefully, you know, if the
Sky Canada recommendations are
implemented and we have a new federal
body that standardize and collects these
reports and they engage in the sort of
public outreach that the Sky Canada
project is recommending, then maybe this
will get on people's radar. Oh, I saw
something weird. It's in the interest of
science that I I report this to this
body. um you know the only way we can
get to truth and answers is with more
and better data and uh you know their
recommendations if implemented would
provide us with more and better data and
I really hope uh I I hope to see that
implemented.
>> Well if implemented is the order of the
day. I sincerely hope Daniel Otus that
you do get an implementation of the
recommendations of the office of the
chief science adviser from the sky
Canada report of June 2025 because I
think it's a very important report. How
can people get in touch with you Daniel
if for example a scientist that has
collaborated with the United States on
secret retrieved alien technology does
want to share some information how do
they get in touch with you? Uh well, you
can find me on Twitter or X uh DS Otus.
My direct messages are always open.
Always happy to move over to more
secured uh communication apps once
initial contact has been made. Um you
can find my website, danielotus.ca,
email me otustories@gmail.com.
Um Google, I'm on YouTube. I'm there.
You can find me. Tell me your stories. I
would really like to hear more about
those allegations. And and I think for
the people out there who might be
equivocating about whether their stories
are relevant, whether they're useful,
please, I mean, either Daniel or I feel
free to come forward. We're very, very
happy to take your tips and very happy
to process them. Daniel Otus, thank you
so much for joining Reality Check. I
look forward to getting you back on the
show when you finally hopefully win your
FOI case against the Lake Ontario
nuclear power plant. and we find out all
about the disturbing UAP sightings that
that plant's so desperately trying to
conceal.
>> Thank you so much for having me. I I am
not going to give up on that or or any
of these. As a journalist, you see a
thread, you got to pull it. So, wherever
it leads us, we'll find the truth.
Thanks a lot, Ross.
