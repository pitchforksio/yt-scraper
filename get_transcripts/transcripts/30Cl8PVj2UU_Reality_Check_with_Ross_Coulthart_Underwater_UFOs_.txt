It started out like as three orbs that
were close together like in a triangular
pattern. They were changing colors from
red, black, orange, some weird oddball
stuff. And they would merge together as
one. They dropped down [music] close to
the water like right above the water and
started coming towards me. Sat there the
rest of the night with a gun in my hand
waiting for something to come creeping
out of the water. I was that scared.
