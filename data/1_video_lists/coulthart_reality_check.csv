Now, there is new evidence, such as an exclusive interview with a neurosurgeon who claims to have telepathically communicated with a live alien being. The incident involved a cigar-shaped UFO crashing in Varginha, Brazil, and a subsequent military intervention. Witnesses, including a pilot and three young girls, reported seeing the alien being. The film also features testimony from military personnel and pathologists who studied the alien's unique bacteria. Fox emphasizes the need for public disclosure and government inquiry into these events.

fKIcd3bfUhI,FULL House UAP hearing with analysis by Ross Coulthart | NewsNation,"A historic House subcommittee hearing Tuesday included never-before-seen video shared by Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo.,  which allegedly shows a Hellfire missile shot from a drone fail to take down an unidentified “orb.” 

Taken on Oct. 30, 2024, off the coast of Yemen, the video appears to show the missile bounce off the object rather than destroy it.

In addition to the video, Tuesday's hearing centered on unidentified anomalous phenomena, government disclosure and protection for whistleblowers. 

NewsNation special correspondent and investigative journalist Ross Coulthart watched along and gave his analysis, live on stream.

iSArCxSar6Q,Darcy Weir on why AARO might be trying to debunk Puerto Rico's Aguadilla object | Reality Check,"In this episode of ""Reality Check,"" Ross Coulthart sits down with filmmaker Darcy Weir and infrared expert David Falch. Together, they investigate the April 2013 Aguadilla UFO sighting: the object that moved over the airport of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, then appeared to enter the water in the adjacent ocean, split and keep on moving. In late March, AARO released its findings on Aguadilla, claiming the object was two sky lanterns. It even suggests the object never went into the water, which does not match the opinions of most viewers. Weir and UFO investigator Andy Marcial work together in the new film ""Puerto Rico's UAPs"" to investigate the 2013 Aguadilla incident and other Puerto Rican anomalous phenomena.

RBAISwCZ2v0,UFO whistleblower David Grusch: 'We are not alone' | Official Ross Coulthart NewsNation interview,"Editor's note: In March 2025, Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., hired David Grusch to work on his staff and advise on UFO investigations (https://x.com/BlakeBurman/status/1904672257227841638)

NewsNation’s reporting on the unidentified anomalous phenomenon issue was followed by Congressional hearings, newly proposed legislation, changes within the Pentagon and reduced stigma for U.S. military personnel reporting unidentified object sightings encountered during missions and training.

In June 2023, NewsNation aired an exclusive TV interview with retired Maj. David Grusch, a U.S. Air Force veteran who had top secret security clearance while working at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, where he co-led the agency’s UAP portfolio.

In the interview, Grusch discusses his investigation and his formal whistleblower complaint. He alleges, under oath, that his UAP Task Force was refused access to a broad crash retrieval program to secure technical craft of nonhuman origin.

mHzVOXCnakY,JFK was killed over UAP transparency desire: intelligence officer | Reality Check,"Ross Coulthart and former intelligence officer Geoff Cruickshank discuss the release of the John F. Kennedy assassination files. Cruickshank tells Coulthart that JFK’s murder was directly related to his knowledge about nonhuman intelligence, and he was assassinated because he planned to reveal this information. Cruickshank also says the released JFK files prove that not only is there a “deep state” in the U.S. government, but he also believes there’s a connection with Marilyn Monroe’s death.

5NHQBoEmYBo,CIA Stargate figure says psychic was 'murdered' | Reality Check with Ross Coulthart,"Sponsor link: https://chuckdefense.com/Ross

On this episode of ""Reality Check,"" Ross Coulthart digs deep into the origins of remote viewing. Russell Targ, a physicist and parapsychologist, tells Ross about his work at the Stanford Research Institute and the CIA's Stargate Project, which involved psychic spies. He shares stories of successful remote viewing, such as finding a Russian bomber and describing a Soviet facility. 
 
Targ emphasizes the ease of learning remote viewing and its accuracy, even at long distances. He also touches on the potential for remote viewing to uncover nonhuman intelligence and the skepticism from mainstream science. But did the remote viewing program go too far? What or who has the CIA scared? And did it lead to the murder of the program's top psychic?

NewsNation's Ross Coulthart will dig further into his claims, including never-before-seen video of an alleged craft recovery and secret meetings with officials on Capitol Hill, Saturday, January 18 at 8p/7C in, “Hunting UFOs: The Crash Retrieval Whistleblower.”

Ross Coulthart says it's time for the government to be transparent about suspected drones spotted in New Jersey, saying he's committed to telling the story no matter what, and ""if the mainstream media is not gonna cover it, we are.”

On today’s ""Reality Check,"" Coulthart speaks to WPIX reporter Katie Corrado, who has been reporting on the drone sightings from on the ground and has even seen them firsthand. 

Corrado says residents are asking why nothing has been made public, wondering: ""If there is nothing to hide, why no one has come out and said anything?” 

Ross also sits down with Gerry Tedesco and John Tedesco of Nightcrawler Research, a data-centric UAP research team. The brothers share exclusive footage of recent drone sightings off the New York coast and their theories of what it shows. 

The brothers say they are in contact with government agencies and having ""productive"" conversations about the drones.

Are we getting closer to exposing the truth about UAPs? On Wednesday, we just might. Congress is putting UAPs and UFOs back on the agenda with a joint hearing being called “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.” On this week’s Reality Check, “Ross Coulthart” speaks with one of the hearings main witnesses: Retired Navy Rear Adm. Tim Gallaudet, Ph. D.

Gallaudet’s message to Ross: “We have evidence that we are not alone,” and he finds the government’s lack of transparency when it comes to UAPs “very troubling.” Gallaudet outlines what this evidence is and why he’s ready to take an oath and tell the world and this bipartisan group of lawmakers what he knows. Gallaudet stresses to Ross that he is proud to be a champion for finding and exposing the truth about UAPs. His book on his service and experiences “Holding Fast in Heavy Seas: Leadership Lessons for Turbulent Times” comes out in July 2025.

Join Ross for a LIVE Q&A about the hearing. He will answer your questions on YouTube and X this Wednesday at 4p.m. ET.

On this episode of “Reality Check,” Ross Coulthart discusses the 2024 presidential election, focusing on Vice President Kamala Harris' and former President Donald Trump’s views on UFOs. He highlights Trump's interest in UAPs, contrasting it with the Biden administration's dismissive stance. Coulthart suggests Trump might reveal UFO information if elected.

Coulthart also recounts past presidential experiences with UFOs, including how some candidates who made candid admissions about UAPs saw negative impacts on their campaigns. He mentions multiple presidents' briefings and admissions, such as Bill Clinton's investigation and Ronald Reagan's fascination.

Coulthart also criticizes the mainstream media's lack of coverage and what he believes is the government's cover-up of UAP.
