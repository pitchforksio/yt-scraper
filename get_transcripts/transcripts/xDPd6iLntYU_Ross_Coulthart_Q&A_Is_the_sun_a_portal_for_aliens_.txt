Good day and welcome to Reality Check
Q&A. I'm your host Ross Kulart and this
is the opportunity for you guys to ask
me the hard questions. Here to ask me as
usual of course my host and colleague
Megan Order. Good day Megan. How are you
>> Ross? I'm great. I just have to start
with a quick apology to you. Um, I
usually have your book on the ladder
right behind me. And when I came down, I
>> got it. It got eaten by aliens or taken
away by the dog.
>> It must have. But when I was looking for
it, I said to myself, you know, Megan,
it has to be in plain sight. [laughter]
So, just I wanted to make sure I gave
you the plug today before.
>> Well, thank you for that gratuitous
plug. Thank you so much for that. It's
nice. Basically, one one does not make
money out of books. I promise you. So,
it's always nice to get a plug.
>> All right, let me fire away at you. I'm
going to start with an email coming in
from Chris. He said to us, "Hello, Ross.
Hope you've been keeping well. I have
two questions for you. Have you ever had
to walk away from a lead because it was
too dangerous or unverifiable? And
what's the most compelling piece of
evidence you've seen that hasn't been
made public yet? Thank you for your
tire, tireless work on the subject."
[laughter]
>> Oh, that's a very ambit claim question.
Um yeah, I've walked away from leads. I
mean, journalists walk away from leads
all the time largely because we can't
corroborate them. Um we we have to
operate according to a very strict
rigorous set of rules in order to avoid
running nonsense. And um uh yeah, I mean
I I get told things all the time. There
are a lot of people who get very
frustrated that I I I don't uh elevate
certain people, certain commentators who
make sweeping assertions.
One of the one of the most difficult
ones is people who contact me and I
actually have some respect for these
people who who purport to be in some
kind of psychic or telepathic
communication with a non-human
intelligence and they want me to put
their message out to the great ether. Uh
you guys. and they think that what
they've got is the absolute truth of
what's really going to happen. And the
difficulty is I've sat down and put all
these things onto a timeline with about
a hundred different people telling me
different things and they often
disagree. Um, you know, one of the good
examples about that is the claims of
catastrophic events that are meant to be
imminent. Uh, people say 2027, people
say 2034.
Uh, I really I mean I've been told
certain things. I've been told, you
know, calamitous geologic events,
calamitous um humaninduced events. Uh I
I'm not really in a position to be able
to say with any certainty that I can
give any of them any credibility. And I
think we do have to we're often accused
by the debunker nut jobs of basically
straying too far on the fringe on this
show. And frankly, I think we're
extremely cautious and rigorous and as
objective as we can be. Uh what an
amazing time, by the way, in science and
UAPs. Who would have thought a year ago
that my friend and colleague Dr. Beatric
Diller would be putting two peer
reviewed pat papers into the um uh
scientific reports uh out of the nature
publications group. You know something
that's been exposed to that degree of
peer review and rigor would have been
thought of as unthinkable a year ago. So
we are making advances. You know there
are things happening but we still have
to stick to rigorous peer review and
checking and corroboration and that's
the main thing why I get cautious. A lot
of people ask me if I've been
threatened. Um no not really. I mean I I
think thankfully because I have an
audience uh you know you guys are
interested and engaged. I think the days
when the national security state or
whoever is responsible for this cover up
felt that they could intimidate somebody
like me uh are I hope well and truly
over because we would broadcast it far
and wide if anybody tried to gag us. In
fact, bring it on guys. We we'd love a
fight. Okay, our next question actually
relates to Dr. Villar Roll. Hi. Hi,
Megan and Ross. Could there be a
connection between these metal spheres
discovered by Dr. Villa role and those
photographed and videoed by the
custodian file channel. Could these
metal spheres be observing us both in
outer space and in our skies? David,
>> look, it's not just the custodian uh
channel that's doing this. I mean, there
are many channels on YouTube that are
reporting on these metallic spheres that
have been seen all over the world. I get
videos almost every week from people
showing me images of what people claim
are metallic spheres with no visible
means of propulsion. There's no
propellers, there's no turbines, no
jets. There's no indication of what's
propelling these objects, but they are
moving silently, fast, uh clearly under
intelligent control all over the world.
And yes, I I do think that we should be
examining and investigating the
hypothesis that there is a link between
what Dr. Beatatric Viller has detected
in geostationary earth orbit uh around
about what 40,000 km away from the
planet. Uh there are these highly
specular reflective flat surfaces that
are clearly there artificial structures
that were there in the 1950s and I
suspect are still there. And
interesting, isn't it interesting that
Beatatric has discovered this with good
science, but you've got spacebased
telescopes that would be perfectly
capable of getting imagery of these
objects. And just witness the deafening
silence from organizations like NASA,
James Webb telescope, um other
space-based telescope operations that
are being operated by some of the
three-letter agencies. They could
resolve this scientific mystery very
quickly. Why don't they? Do they already
know the answer? That that's the kind of
questions I think we should be asking. I
think we're at a point now in the
disclosure narrative where it's becoming
patently clear that Congress has become
captive, as it always has been, to the
national security state. And we're not
going to see any real activism from most
of the people in Congress. There are the
heroes who we all respect and admire
mainly the members of the um oversight
transparency committee. But the uh the
simple fact is Congress has been
knobbled. The key committee chairman
chairpeople have basically been knobbled
and more importantly their staffers are
captive to the future jobs they're
looking forward to in respective private
aerospace companies. It's quite
depressing and sad. And so the best hope
for us all is good science is good
rigorous public community-based
investigation that breaks open this
walnut. And I do think that's going to
happen. Just keep on chipping on. Okay,
we'll go to our next question. Hi Ross
and Megan. Can you tell me your thoughts
on SETI? I find it strange that some
leading scientists such as Gary Nolan
and the like are saying NHI are real and
yet SETI are spending millions on
searching for the WOW signal. It makes
no sense to me. Don't they talk to each
other? They can't both be right. Love
the show. Martin and Allison in the UK.
>> Look, we've done a previous reality
check on SETI. We interviewed the boss
of SETI and whilst I respect any
scientific investigation into the
subject of possible extraterrestrial
life. I have asked and I did ask at the
time, why is SETI so focused on radio
signals? Would an highly advanced alien
civilization
likely be using radio signals to
communicate when they move at the best
at the speed of light and frankly they
take a hell of a long time to cover
multiund light years across a solar
system. It's not the best way to
communicate. And we know now
theoretically that it is possible to to
communicate using um quantum
communications, entangled uh photon
cubits. And the whole possibility exists
that it would be possible to have a
communication system using entangled
photons that could instantaneously
communicate communicate across vast
distances of the universe. And I'm not
the one that thought of this. There's
actually a great paper that I recommend
to you. I've I'm I'm a fan of this
paper. It's called on interstellar
quantum communication and the fermy
paradox by a guy called Lean Boille. And
uh he was part of the Higs Center for
Theoretical Physics. And back in 2024,
he actually wrote a paper that
speculated that the reason we're not
hearing from aliens in terms of
communications on SETI is because they
don't use radio waves. Perhaps they're
using quantum communications. And he
suggested that interstellar quantum
communication is the likely way it's
happening. And this would render the
signals effectively silent or
undetectable to our current classical
radio or optical detection systems. And
it's funny, you know, because when we
asked City about this, they've spent
probably, I think, last estimates was
around about a half a billion dollars,
some of that private money, public
contributions since 1960 through to the
present day. So over 65 years, half a
billion dollars has been spent on radio
communications interception to see if we
can find alien civilizations that might
be communicating using radio waves. And
what have we heard? Nutter. Okay,
there's the wow signal, but that's still
up in the air. Bottom line is I don't
think if there are aliens, and I suspect
there are, I don't think they're using
radio signals at all. It doesn't make a
lot of sense. Why use why use radio
signals when you can use, you know, why
go analog when you can go digital?
>> Correct. Um, let's go to X. This is Ben
for reality check. Does Ross know of any
undersea structures that have been
encountered by any Navy? Does he know if
there are designated no-go areas for the
Navy to go in regarding potential
undersea USO activity? Fantastic work as
always, both of you.
>> That's a really good question. Yes, I am
privy there's a guy from the Royal
Australian Navy who contacted me who
will not go on the record, but he it's
secondhand information, but it's pretty
reliable. his dad who was in the Navy
told him that there are areas off the
Australian coast that are, how does one
say this, known to the Australian Navy.
And um it was really interesting because
sadly um uh his dad has passed away in
the interim, but um he gave me an
enormous amount of detail about a
location off the Australian coast and I
would love to go and investigate it. If
anybody's got a submarine and a sonar
system, we'll go out there and check it
out. I'm a huge fan of the idea, the
theory that there are megalithic
civilizations, including perhaps the
idea of Atlantis that have been buried
as, you know, tectonic movements have
happened on the earth. And I've always
been interested in a case that happened
um about 2 or 3 years ago. There was a
couple that came forward and they had uh
allegedly using highbeam soda sonar
discovered pyramids and entire cities
with streets under the ground um just
off the coast of Cuba. And like so many
of these stories, this story came and
went Zizz. But there are the most
amazing sonar images of what do look
like I think it's about 600 m under the
ocean. They do look like um pyramids
underneath the ocean and straight
streets. These are not naturally
occurring objects as one Cuban scientist
tried to suggest at the time. So yes,
I'm fascinated by the idea also of
megalithic uh civilizations and
structures. There's also, don't forget,
that weird shape that appeared on Google
Maps, which was underwater. I'm not
quite sure how Google Maps could
represent something that was underwater.
It was underwater just off the coast of
California. And I think from memory,
Rear Admiral retired
um Tim Galedet uh mentioned that it was
a subject of interest for him. And
interestingly enough, soon after it
became public, it was quietly blurred on
Google Maps. Now, just a bit of a heads
up, we are going to be taking a very
close interest in underwater submerged
objects on a future reality check
special for News Nation. And you're
going to be hearing a whole lot more
from us about the subject of underwater
objects. Um, there are no go areas. I've
spoken to people in our submarine
service in Australia, people in the
submarine service in the US. There are
definite nogo areas in uh parts of the
Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean. Um but
more often than not, they're ranges that
are used for gunnery practice and um uh
military training. But of course, one of
the best ways to hide something that you
don't want the public to know about
would be to secure it off as a secure
military area. So yeah, maybe there is
something down there. We just don't
know. I have had a succession of
submariners contact me from US, British,
French, and Australian submarine
services who have quietly told me about
confrontations with enormous objects
underwater, often traveling, believe it
or not, at faster than the speed of
sound in water, which is mind-boggling
if you think about it. So, um, yeah, I
am fascinated by the idea that there
are, if you think about it, you know, so
much of the Earth's surface is covered
with water. And if you were a nonhuman
civilization trying to stay out of
sight, but also wanting to monitor these
primitive apes up on the land, the water
would be a good place to hide.
>> I definitely agree. Let's go to an
email. This is from Will in Texas. Why
does it seem that for over 50 years, the
media, including movies and
entertainment, have been slowly exposing
us to the concept of aliens, largely a
threat narrative, and some
whistleblowers have come forward with
the same narrative. Yet, the government
and military-industrial complex had
numerous opportunities to come forward
based on this long-standing preparation,
but hasn't come clean. Do you think it
is that the news would be a shock to
civilization or more that it would
disrupt special interests in energy and
control that some don't want to give up?
Also tell Megan she is the best ever
especially with Bigfoot will in
[laughter] Texas. [gasps]
>> Um look, yeah, I mean you're right. The
threat narrative has been a consistent
theme in Hollywood. Aliens as threat and
it goes right back to the 40s and the
50s when the first Alien movies started
uh started coming. But there are the odd
exceptions, notably Steven Spielberg.
And I'm really looking forward to Steven
Spielberg's imminent movie. I'm told
it's going to be very interesting. Uh,
let's not forget also that um David
Grush has been an adviser. It's been
reported on a future Jerry Brookenheimr
film that's going to be investigating
the covert cover up inside government
and private aerospace. So, there are
some great movies coming. But yes,
you're right. there is a Hollywood
threat narrative. And yes, there is an
argument in ufology that the threat
narrative is wrong and that most um
nonhuman intelligence engagements or
encounters by humans have been
benevolent and friendly, but not all of
them. I mean, I I keep on thinking of
the Calar incidents in Brazil where
people were in fact killed or maimed
with some kind of bean weapon. There
have been incidents where there's been
malevolence or at the very least
indifference by a non-human intelligence
reportedly towards human beings. Um,
what do I favor? I guess I'm hoping that
a non-human intelligence is benevolent,
kind, and probably interested in our
future survival. Or maybe what they're
interested in is preserving our planet.
Maybe it's not us they're worried about.
It's what we're doing to our planet.
Maybe there's something special about
Earth that they're trying to preserve.
Um, whatever it is, I I do think I I
agree. I mean, I think there's
definitely been a threat narrative
pushed in Hollywood. And this isn't to
be dismissed because many Hollywood
movies are influenced directly by the
Pentagon. They've literally had people
who in return for the use of Pentagon
resources, you know, we'll give you a
Huey Chopper if you push this particular
line in your movie. That's been a
consistent way that Hollywood has been
controlled and influenced by the
Pentagon and by the intelligence
community. And um there is some great
books that you can read that talk about
the way that Hollywood has been
influenced by particularly the CIA. And
what's quite interesting is the guy at
the CIA who was involved in doing that
liaison with Hollywood actually talked
quite openly about how while he was
working in the CIA, he stumbled across
documents that verified I think the
Roswell incident as being a non-human
intelligence event, he somehow
disappeared from public site. I hope
he's all right. Um, yeah, let's keep on
digging. And uh I'm certainly hoping and
expecting that the new Spielberg movie
in particular is going to be a very
interesting one. I've often thought
Steven Spielberg was very well informed.
>> Okay, we will go to an email. This is
from Redeye. Um he says, "I need to
apologize. I used to chuckle at people
that believed in UFOs, skinwalker,
catamulations, and shadow people. No
more. You, Alzando, Melon, Nell, Knap,
and Nolan have detailed firsthand
accounts from such credible, honest, and
believable people. I am convinced about
NHI. However, questions still linger.
Based upon your interview with Yosua,
what is your best guess as to the
connection between cattle mutilations
near and nuclear bases/ UFOs? Seems like
a disconnect. Also, could shadow people,
skinwalkers, etc. be an artifact of
perception created by NHI to create a
shell of ridiculousness to foster
ridicule. Much like the Bell test pilot
flying out of the Edwards, Jack Woolams
who wore a gorilla mask, derby hat, and
cigar and their attempts to discredit
people that witnessed their flights.
>> That's a really interesting question.
It's funny. I was actually thinking
about this yesterday. I was watching
something that was talking about this
exact issue. You know, why are there
cattle mutilations? Well, firstly, maybe
the aliens like beef, but that's not
really a plausible uh explanation
because most of what's taken in cattle
mutilations is not actually the prime
cuts. Often it's um areas of the face,
often the skin, the tissue all around
the skull, some of the internal organs
like um the amassum inside the cow, one
of the internal stomachs. um you know,
frankly, they're not the most um
delicious or dectable items in in the
beef. I I'm drawn to a theory. I I'll
throw this out there. It's totally
speculative, but I'm drawn to a theory
that cattle mutilations, a lot of what
we see, a lot of what humans are being
shown
is performance art. that what it is is a
non-human intelligence
trying to wake us up, trying to kindle a
human awareness that there is something
else. U maybe cattle mutilations are
just a way of completely freaking us out
that whatever this is, it's anomalous.
It's unusual. Well, there is there is
one explanation that I'm prepared to
give an airing that the speculation that
Yakob Kfelt's disease is an issue of
concern and that there's been some kind
of monitoring program. I think it's
called BSE boine inopathy
uh uh virus. Uh we've had to kill cows
in the UK I remember at one stage and I
think it's happened in the US as well.
We're very strong in Australia about
monitoring it. we're always getting in
trouble with the Americans because we're
we're very restrictive on beef imports
because we're trying to protect our
local industry. And maybe there's an
awareness about some kind of disease
that's spreading inside the cattle
population. The problem with that theory
is it's not just cattle. Uh there are
mutilated horses that I've investigated
here in Australia, mutilated kangaroos.
Um, something is doing performance art
with animals. [snorts] And I do find
cattle mutilations.
I'll be honest about it. It's a freaky
mystery. Uh, and it's still happening. I
I get messages about alleged mutilations
of animals, not just cattle, almost
probably every month or so, to every two
or three weeks. And uh, the most recent
ones I've had have been in the American
Midwest. I've seen some of them have
been reported in the American media and
I've even spoken to both an FBI team and
also to Canadian investigators that have
been investigating cattle mutilations up
in British Columbia. Something is going
on. Either it's a bunch of humans going
around causing mischief, but if they
are, they've got very sharp knives and
they're doing kind of laser cuts that
defy explanation. You know, these are
animals which are found often with
literally all of the skin, all of the
tissue, including whatever you call the
tissue in between the teeth. Um,
literally all of the tissue has been
excised from the animal. And what you're
seeing is a a perfectly normal animal
below the head. And then above the head,
it's like just a skull. And uh, it's
weird because the bone's still got
moisture in it. And I can't explain it.
I don't know why any non-human
intelligence would want to do something
like that unless it's trying to freak us
out. Um, and it is it's pretty scary.
The the implications of it are quite
scary. But why what the motivations are
for why they or it is doing it, I have
no bloody idea. Absolutely not. If
anyone's got any suggestions, please let
me know.
>> Okay, this is the Steve on X. Hey Megan
and Ross, thanks for your dedication and
first class reporting on the UAP
subject. I've heard a couple of things
about our son being more than we know.
And I was wondering if Ross had heard
anything about this apart from the
recent Jesse Michaels interview with Dan
Sherman.
>> Just for those of you who haven't seen
it, I strongly recommend you do watch.
It was a great effort [clears throat] by
Jesse. Um he finally scored the
interview that um a lot of us have been
trying to get with Dan Sherman um who
wrote a fantastically intriguing book
hinting at the fact or suggesting very
overtly that the United States Air Force
has indeed been working with people who
have psychical psionic abilities for
quite a long time. Dan described how uh
during his service in the Air Force, he
was enlisted into a secret program where
he was essentially um taught how to
telepathically communicate with
non-human intelligences and to relay
communications most of which he had no
understanding of to and from uh both
humans and nonhumans. Uh it implied that
there was a very organized program being
run through the opaces of the National
Security Agency. And look, frankly, I
find Dan Sherman highly credible. uh you
know he he tells a absolutely amazing
story but it does mesh with accounts
that I've had from other people inside
the national security uh infrastructure
uh who tell me that there are still
ongoing uses of psionics inside the
system. I'm not sure that the program uh
project preserve destiny that Dan was
part of is still operating but uh it
does intrigue me that um uh you know he
he did describe his own communications
with nonhumans and Jesse's done a
marvelous job I think it's several hours
it runs for about three hours
interviewing Dan in great detail and uh
you can also get his book Above Black uh
on Amazon and uh one of the things he
talked about to come to the question is
he talked about how in one of the
conversations he had with the purported
non-human intelligence it told Dan that
we humans do not have a sufficient
understanding of the importance of our
sun and um the nonhuman intelligence
implied that the sun is used as some
kind of a portal uh almost had a
reverential tone directed towards the
sun that we humans don't yet realize its
full significance
we merely see it as a source of light
and energy, but um uh we would
eventually understand the significance
of the sun at some time in the future.
And I made notes at the time because I
thought it was actually quite
significant what he told Jesse. Um he
had a an alien called which he nicknamed
bones and another one called Spock. And
he explained they think around time.
It's not linear like ours. And then this
this whole thing with solar portals. The
sun's not just a star. It's a nexus
point. You go in one side and you're out
in another system. Sounds a bit like the
sun's some kind of black hole. And um
what I loved about this is that it it it
conjoins with ideas that I've read about
in physics papers about the first three
paragraphs I can understand where they
talk about Einstein Rosen bridges
wormholes and is the sun capable of
being a wormhole. Sherman suggests that
they are stabilized by the sun's immense
gravitational and electromag magnetic
energy which makes our sun a preferred
entry and exit point for visitors to
Earth's solar system. I loved all this
idea and I thought it was great how much
detail Dan had about it. Um he claimed
that um aliens harness the sun's energy
via Dyson spherelike structures or
plasma manipula manipulation
echoing the Kardashive type 2
civilization scale where a society can
fully utilize a star's energy. and he
said um the the sun is some kind of
portal to other star systems like a
Dyson sphere but more harnessing it for
jumps.
And then um at one point I I made a lot
of notes about this cuz I was really
struck by it. He recounted a telepathic
exchange where an entity expressed awe
about our sonly humans undervalue it.
quote, he was talking about how we
really don't understand the value of our
son and that we will at some point
eventually understand it. It was this
profound reverence like the sun is the
creator, the source. And he then went on
to say how the alien had told him these
portals connect all the stars in a kind
of network. It's why they revere
creation so much. The sun isn't just
energy. It's the loom weaving realities.
And um uh it's interesting because uh
Dan I actually quite like his brain. He
talked about Capernacus and how
Capernacus had this idea, a very
mystical conception of the sun beyond
just being an orbiting star. It's like
he knew it was a portal. So yeah, I mean
there are some ideas here and it's part
of a broader um uh a broader UFO
narrative. You know, if you think about
um
uh the suggestions that there are craft
using exotic propulsion systems, maybe
this is what they're doing. Maybe they
are using some kind of wormhole near our
sun. And it it might explain these weird
images that people sometimes publish
which show gigantic
apparent craftlike objects near the sun
that seem to be doing something with the
sun's plasma. Um, I truly have to admit
that everything I'm saying here is
totally speculative and it may may be a
load of cobblers. We have no idea. Um, I
just wish that um, good science could
shed more light on this and uh, I hope
eventually it will.
>> Okay, Russ, you mentioned the name Spock
in there and I think that that's the
name of a character from Star Trek. If
I'm wrong, please do not eat me alive in
the comments.
>> How could you not know that? I mean,
it's logical.
>> I guess I [laughter] should have said,
"Please don't leave me alive, Ross." Um,
but our last question connects to that.
If Ross was in Star Trek Starfleet,
which decision would he see himself in,
command, engineering, security, or
science?
>> I'm sorry. I'm big-headed enough and I I
like what Captain Kirk had. I he he he
not only commanded, he always I mean it
was always ridiculous to me as someone
who knows how the commander of a vessel
has to be protected uh because they're
meant to be the brains and the boss. It
was always hilarious to me that Jim Kirk
was always the guy who got captured by
the aliens and he was always falling in
love with all the alien women uh because
he was the guy who was the point man for
the whole ship. All of these young
sailors on board the Enterprise were
basically left behind and it was Jim
Kirk and um Scotty and Spock that
basically went down to the ground and
did all the hard work on the ground. A
little bit implausible, but frankly I
want Kirk's job.
>> So if you're Kirk, what does that make
me your producer? [laughter]
>> You could be um Uhuru. Uh is it Uhhuru
the um the the the command navigator?
Uhura. Okay. So, that's what we'll say
now because usually when when you and I
>> super super smart woman who knew exactly
what she was doing and constantly saved
us all from idiocy. How does that sound?
[laughter]
>> So, we this is what we'll call it now
because usually when you and I do things
like live feeds, we say we're going to
do the Payton and Eli playbook, but now
I'm going to say the Kirk and her hira
playbook. It'll be a little internal
thing for us from now on.
>> Sounds Sounds good to me. You know, it's
really interesting. Um, Gene Rodenbury,
who wrote Star Trek, there's a lot of
speculation. I think he was a navigator
in World War II, but it turns out he had
some very influential friends who were
working inside what now passes, I
suspect, for the legacy UAP program. He
was very connected and I a lot of people
have suggested to me that Gene
Rodenbury's ideas of the prime directive
which is one of the ideas in Star Trek
that Kirk and his team could never show
themselves to an alien civilization
because to do so would be to interfere
in the affairs of a developing
civilization. And so the idea was there
was this prime directive that you you do
not uh bring in highly advanced
technology. you allow civilizations to
develop under their own steam. And I've
always thought it was very interesting
that Gene Rodenbury, the the um creator
of Star Trek, was very much the
progenitor of that idea. And who
informed that idea? Can that explain why
if there is a non-human intelligence,
it's not engaging with us more overtly?
I suspect it is.
>> Okay, Ross, that was the last one for
today. Thank you.
>> Oh, great. Thank you, uh, Megan, or
should I say Uhura. Um uh we are uh in
need of reminding you that if you do
want to ask us questions, you can direct
questions to reality checks
