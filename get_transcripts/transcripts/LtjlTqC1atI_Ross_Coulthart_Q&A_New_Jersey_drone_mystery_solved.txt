Well, good day and welcome to Reality
Check Q&A, the question and answer where
you guys get to ask me the hard
questions. And here to help me through
it this week yet again, my friend and
colleague Megan Order. How are you,
Megan?
>> Ross, I'm just fantastic. How are you
this week?
>> I'm good. I'm good. I've got a mildly
sore eye. Okay, I got something in my
eye, but apart from that, I'm passing
mustard.
>> All right. Well, we will not take it
easy on you like normal.
>> Yeah, be kind. Be kind to me.
>> We'll see. Let's start here, though. Um,
we have an article from NPR that we'd
love to get your comments on. They're
saying a classified network of SpaceX
satellites is emitting a mysterious
signal. What do you think that could be?
>> Ah, okay. So, as I understand it, um
Elon Musk does do Secret Squirrel stuff
at SpaceX with his um satellite
launches. And there has been apparently
a very highly classified launch of
Starlink related satellites called Star
Shield. Nobody knows what they're used
for. They're apparently part of some
classified defense program. And there
has been some uh concern that they're
normally meant to be used in that
frequency band for transmissions from
the earth up to a space object. But in
this case, the a very clever um uh
monitor of these frequencies noticed
that there are transmissions coming down
from these star shield satellites to
Earth. And one can only assume that it's
all legitimate and authorized because
obviously it's being done in collusion
with the defense department. Um it it
could be purely and simply that it's
something Starlink Star Shield's doing
to um to monitor those satellites, data
monitoring, or it could perhaps be that
they've stumbled across something covert
and secretive. But one thing's for sure,
the communications are almost certainly
encrypted. I certainly hope they are.
There was a time once during the Gulf
War when encryptions didn't happen on
some transponders on some military
satellites and people like me were able
to see drone feeds from Afghanistan and
Iraq. It was a great period for about 3
months and we kept it all secret and we
were watching the incredible capacities
of these drones and then somebody
blabbed and talked about it in the story
and revealed all. So, um I don't know
any more than that there is a secret uh
group of satellites called Star Shield
that have been linked by Starlink.
They're part of a defense program. I
think it's related to the National
Geospatial Intelligence Agency. That's
all I know. If anyone knows any more,
please let me know. We'd love to know
more.
>> Okay, great. We are going to move on to
one of our other favorite topics,
drones. The New York Post put out an
article this week and the headline is
New Jersey drone and UFO scare solved.
Private contractor unveils strange
aircraft takes credit for sky mystery.
>> Okay, look, I I there's been a couple of
well-placed stories in the last few
weeks trying to I think debunk as much
as possible. We had another delivery
from Joel Shetman at the Wall Street
Journal, who's fast becoming the
splenetic debunker of choice for the
defense community and intelligence
community. And we had a well-placed New
York Post story which quoted an unnamed
contractor uh who was um presenting uh a
claim that some craft the nature of
which is not revealed was responsible
for the 2024 New Jersey sightings where
people were saying that they were seeing
UFOs. And the New York Post gave this
which is a tabloid newspaper which means
it gives things a bit of stick as we say
in media. It gives stories a good
thrashing. Uh it quoted that this was
the solution to the New Jersey drone
flap and uh it was obviously some kind
of classified military technology. Now
even if assuming that that's true, let
let's assume for a moment that that's
true, which I actually don't think it
is. I'm sorry. I just do not buy the
explanation that came from the White
House that these are FAA authorized
research drones because we know that
General Guilo and General Glenn Van
Herk, both former and serving bosses of
Northcom NORAD, admitted on the record
to both 60 Minutes and in later public
comments that they still have absolutely
no idea what these New Jersey objects
were or are because they are continuing.
they're still up there. Moreover, if you
actually look at drone sightings, not
just in New Jersey, but across the
continent of the United States and
indeed internationally, let's let's go
through it. I've I've got a list here
myself. I mean, there are extraordinary
numbers of drones that have been um
recorded uh all over the world. We've
got sightings across the United States,
November to December to January 2024,
ongoing into this year. New Jersey, New
York, thousands of reports of swarms
over residential areas, Langley Air
Force Base. Are we seriously meant to
believe according to this unnamed this
anonymous defense contractor that they
were hovering over Langley Air Force
Base where drone anti- drone technology
was used unsuccessfully and that this
was all part of some kind of authorized
research program. I'm sorry, I'm not
buying this. When the Air Force has made
it abundantly clear that they had no
idea what these objects were over
Langley Air Force Base and indeed um uh
plant 42 in California and Vandenberg
Air Force Base. So, I'm sorry, I'm not
buying it. And then you go on, are we
honestly saying that this purported
drone company that's made this new craft
that's the New York Post is putting up
as the explanation for the drone
reports? Are we saying that it's also
responsible for the November flaps over
Raph Mildenhal in the United Kingdom,
Feltwell, Fairford in Suffk, in Norfolk
and Gstersha? There were sightings all
over some of the most sensitive British
military airspace in the United Kingdom.
Are we suggesting that that unnamed
drone so-called manufacturer was
responsible for those sightings? I mean,
the most plausible explanation that's
been offered to date without any
evidence at all is that it's possible
Russian surveillance or some kind of um
stealth warfare, hybrid warfare. And
this is the favored explanation by a lot
of people with military backgrounds, but
it's the default explanation. As of
right now, late October 2025, we still
have no explanation, no definitive
explanation at all for any of this
purported drone activity. And if you go
on, most recently it was in Germany,
Denmark, Norway, Poland, broader Western
Europe. You had corrupt air base in
Denmark. Multiple military sites across
Denmark and Norway. Copenhagen airport
in Germany. You had Rammstein Air Force
Base, NATO bases of Brun, uh Rhin Metal
facilities in Germany, Munich airport. I
mean, are we seriously suggesting, as
somebody who's obviously provided this
convenient story to the New York Post is
trying to do, that this explains all of
these anomalous drone reports? Have you
noticed how these purported drone object
stories have disappeared off the front
page? And yet, I'm still getting
messages from people saying that they're
seeing these objects in and around
facilities. I heard from Beatric Vill,
Dr. Beatric Fillerol in Sweden that a
group of fishermen just off the coast of
Sweden were pillaried by debunkers in
Sweden because they had the ghoul to
stand up and say that they'd seen
anomalous objects over the ocean. And
the debunker explanation didn't wash,
but that didn't matter. That's what went
out in the media. The simple fact is
that there is no proper explanation at
this date. There has been no recovery of
any craft. There has been no identica
identification of any nation that is
definitely involved. And of course, if
it was the Russians, people would say,
"Yeah, this kind of hybrid warfare is
done by stealth." You know, they're
probably very good at concealing it. But
if I was the West and I knew it was the
Russians and I could prove it was the
Russians, I would have done it by now.
And I don't think they can because I
don't think they have any evidence. And
so let's keep the heat up on this drone
story because I think the word drone
itself is an attempt at ethmological
determinism. They're trying to mold what
the public thinks about these objects
before we've even reached a conclusion
about them. They are objects of unknown
origin. Yes, some of them have been
aircraft that people have misidentified,
but it's becoming abundantly clear that
the military and civilian authorities
right across Europe have acknowledged
that they cannot identify these objects
or find their source or track them back
to source. Same thing in America. uh two
generals, very senior Northcom Norad
generals, made a definitive statement
that they had absolutely no idea where
these objects coming from or what they
are and they were penetrating airspace,
including highly sensitive national
security installations with impunity.
And it worries me that so much of the
national media, including the New York
Post in this case, just glibly accept
the anonymous, off therecord assertions
made by a purported manufacturer of a
purported new craft. In my job, you've
got to test these allegations more. I'd
be looking for more evidence before I
made a claim like that. I do not think
that this purported craft satisfactorily
explains all of the purported drone
sightings that have been occurring. End
of rant.
>> Well, unfortunately, the rant is going
to continue because Kevin from Canada
has a question on this topic. Good
morning to you both. Do you think that
the reason we do not have as many UIP
sightings in Canada is because we do not
have nuclear weapons? Specifically, I'm
talking about the drone sightings.
Really enjoy your show. I was happy to
see some Canadian content. Thank you,
Kevin.
>> That's a good question, Kevin. I mean,
it would be speculative on my part, but
yes, I do suspect that what these
objects are focusing on quite often, it
appears to be facilities where there's
almost a likelihood that nuclear weapons
or um technology related to nuclear
weapons or highly sensitive such
military technology would likely be
stored. Uh the Copenhagen airport one,
for example, is a mystery. That's an
exclusion there. U I I do think that
maybe something's doing a show. Uh there
have been, by the way, objects seen over
Canada. I've had correspondents from
around Toronto. Um there are objects
being seen in Canada, but certainly not
with the frequency or intensity that's
being seen just across the border in the
USA. But yeah, I take your point. There
is definitely a link between UAPs and
nuclear facilities and nuclear weapons.
>> Okay, there are some other big news that
has come out. The film The Age of
Disclosure, um they are posting on X and
everywhere else that their film is
finally being released. It's going to
come on November 21st worldwide, Prime
Video, and in select US theaters. Um
viewer question here from Baz Ball. Hi
Ross, with Age of Disclosure releasing
soon, do you think it will move the
needle for disclosure still after being
delayed for a couple of years along with
pretty high prices to buy on Amazon?
Also, do you think that there's a chance
of David Crush's oped ever coming out?
>> Okay, there's two questions there. Let
me deal with the David Grush one first.
I don't think I'm giving anything away
if I say I think there's going to be a
David Grush interview coming up soon,
like a a TV interview. Uh, that's to
come. Let's just wait and see what
happens there. As for the op-ed, that's
up to the mainstream media organizations
that appear to be doing their level best
to try and suppress this story. Um, I
certainly know David's been very keen to
get his viewpoint out there. Uh, hence
the new interview. um on the age of
disclosure. Wow. My favorite quote from
this is Jay Stratton, the former head of
the UAP task force in the Pentagon. And
he says, "As a firsthand witness," and
it's in the trailer. You would have seen
it from the beginning of this year. I
have seen with my own eyes nonhuman
craft and nonhuman
beings. Doesn't get any more definitive
than that. For the life of me, I do not
know why Congress hasn't put Jay
Stratton under oath in the public
hearing or in a private hearing and
deposed him to find out what he knows. I
suspect he probably has given private
evidence, but I'd love to see him in the
public arena. Maybe the simple fact is
that Congress is playing along with the
attempts by the national security state
to keep all this under wraps and a lot
of what's being done in Cong Congress is
titled to try and amuse us pe people in
the public arena to stop us from asking
too many questions. Um the age of
disclosure is going to be a very very
important documentary. It's going to air
both as a theatrical release but it's
also going to be aired I think on
Netflix and that's huge. Oh, it might be
Amazon. Hang on. I'm not quite sure.
Don't quote me there.
>> Amazon,
>> but it's Amazon.
>> But it's [clears throat] got Lu Lzando,
Jay Stratton, as I've just mentioned,
Hal Putoff, Eric Davis. Now, Eric's
important because of course he's the
astrophysicist physicist who had the
conversation with Admiral Tom Wilson,
the former deputy DIA boss at the time,
uh, who had basically, uh, had the
problems trying to get access to the
legacy program. and he set out allegedly
in um detail to Dr. Eric Davis what he
knew about the legacy program, the
retrieval program and the cover up and
the attempts to reverse engineer. That's
that of course is a highly disputed
memo. There's another person by the way
we could call call Dr. Dave Davis and
call Admiral Tom Wilson, put them under
oath and see how they answer it. Marco
Rubio is also appearing which
[clears throat] is quite something. I
mean, this is the right-hand man to the
president uh Marco Rubio, Secretary of
State and also um national security
director uh since the previous director
left in ignity. Uh and he presumably has
been briefed into the program, which is
what I understand has happened
relatively recently. There's been a much
broadening awareness amongst the Trump
administration of just what it is that
the Pentagon and intelligence community
know about UAPs.
The big issue [clears throat] now for
all of us is what the Trump
administration does with that. Are they
just going to roll over supinely and let
the national security state tickle their
tummy and say, "Hey guys, we just need
to keep this quiet because it's our
little secret and we'd be jeopardizing
all manner of exciting and expensive
projects that we have in defense that,
you know, shouldn't be revealed because
the public doesn't have a right to know
about it. Or are we going to give the
public their due and tell them what
their money has been being spent on for
the last 60, 70 years? Um, one of the
other people that's featuring in the age
of disclosure is James Clapper, the
former DNI, director of national
intelligence, and he says some pretty
interesting things in the documentary.
It's quite significant to get a a former
DNI speaking publicly. Chris Melon, of
course, is appearing. Senator Mike RS is
appearing. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand,
David Fraver, the retired Navy pilot,
Alex Dietrich as well, Ryan Graves,
Admiral Tim Galedet, uh, former CIA
senior executive Jim Siman, and Colonel,
retired Army Colonel Carl Nell. Um, so
this is a pretty heavyhitting
documentary. Uh, I'm excited. Uh, I do
think that, um, uh, there are claims in
this film that that haven't been made
before. I understand one of the claims
is that Russia recovered an 80 foot long
tic tac with bodies and directed energy
weapons. There's also claim of a Vatican
cover up. Um there's also expressed
concerns about how Nutin,
the Treasury Secretary, was um briefed
on economic fallout. And the claim is
made that the CIA and the Department of
Energy have run the crash retrieval
program since 1947 post Roswell that
UAPs have indeed disabled nukes that
there's been technological risks
weaponization justify the the secrecy of
the so-called but they demand the
release of this information for the
purposes of obtaining clean energy and
solving climate problems. Um, I I do
think it is Disclosure on steroids. It's
potentially a hugely significant
mainstream film that will reach an
audience that to date has not yet
engaged with this subject. And I commend
Lou Alzando and Dan Farah, who are the
joint executive producers who have
produced this film. Um, it's great to
finally see it getting to air and I
sincerely hope it has the effect that it
should have. Sadly, I'm not holding my
breath because you're seeing already
counter articles appearing in stool
debunker newspapers like the the Wall
Street Journal. Dear old Joel Shepman's
cutting out the usual tired old lines
and doing his level best to try and
anticipate the release of this kind of
film to try and play down in the public
mind that there's anything to this UAP
subject. Why on earth do journalists
allow themselves to be so produced and
manipulated by the national security
state? Our job is to poke a greasy
finger in the eyes of power and cause as
much mischief as possible to tease and
question power not to be supplicant lick
spittles. Enough said. Thank you, Megan.
>> Thank you, Ross. Um, let's go to a
question from UFO Jack. Is Ross involved
in any efforts getting individuals of
wealth to donate money so physical
security can be provided to
whistleblowers that actually have
evidence of UFOs? It's clear Congress
won't.
>> Wow. Gee, I wish I could just dial me up
a billionaire. It'd be fantastic. Uh uh
look, I actually don't think the issue
is the necessity to provide personal
security to these people, although that
is an issue. I mean, there are some
people that are fearing for their
personal safety. And I do believe that
some people have been threatened, hurt
or indeed murdered to protect this
secret. So yes, personal security is an
issue. The bigger issue is frankly the
fact that Congress has completely failed
to date to implement the laws that are
needed to protect these whistleblowers
when they come forward. It's hugely
frustrating. I've spoken to people in
the Senate uh in the House who ask me to
help them bring forward people with
direct firsthand knowledge of the
retrieval and reverse engineering
program. And when I approach these
people, they quite sagely point out to
me that the are not the protections
particularly for contractors. Yes, there
are protections for people serving in
the military who come forward. But if
you're a contractor, and most of this is
kept in secret in private contractor
aerospace companies, you are not
protected. You do not enjoy the
whistleblower protections. And that's
why the UAP Disclosure Act uh laws that
were being sought to be implemented
within the National Defense U
appropriations, that was why it was so
important. Now, I'm told we should all
be heartened by uh Representative Eric
Berles's announcement on the weekend at
the um New Paradigm Institute's uh
disclosure conference that I was a part
of. Eric, uh, Representative Eric Berles
revealed that he has agreed to
co-sponsor the same UAP disclosure laws
as a standalone bill, which is a
wonderful piece of news. And sorry to
sound nerdy and legalistic for a moment,
but this is important. It's important
because it means there's still a
possibility that these laws could be put
before both the Senate and the House and
that we could get disclosure laws um
into the law which would protect these
whistleblowers. That's what's needed
most of all. Yes, in some cases people
do need personal security protection.
But the thing that's most needed is for
these people to feel that their jobs,
their pensions, their livelihoods, their
families won't be jeopardized if they
come forward with evidence that reveals
illegality, impropriy involving the
expenditure of monies in breach of the
constitution. Now, that's the issue
that's, you know, first and foremost
right now. and we need to ensure that we
have those legislative protections in
place to protect those people. When
we've got those, I'm very confident
people are going to come forward.
They're just waiting for Congress to do
its job. The simple fact here is there's
two problems. We've got staffers in
Congress. There are some very good
staffers, some of whom I speak to
regularly, who are genuinely committed
to disclosure and getting this issue out
there because they recognize it's real.
They've heard from witnesses in camera
in skiffs and they know that there is
this cover up involving crash
retrievalss and reverse engineering. But
the problem is there are also staffers
and some of them are more powerful than
some of these committees who frankly are
self-interested. All they want is a cozy
well-paid job in private enterprise and
some rich beneficent private aerospace
contractor when they get out of
political service in Congress. And so
while they're serving their politician,
they have a second master or mistress,
they are serving the supplicant
interests of the private aerospace
manufacturers that come to lobby them.
And how hard is it for them to resist
the intreaties of a private aerospace
company that says to them, "Hey, listen.
It would really help if you could bury
this UAP disclosure stuff. It's not
helping. make that one go away and we'll
give you a cushy 500,000 bucks a year
job at Northrup Grumman or Loheed
Martin. That's how it works. Um the
other issue frankly is the congressmen
and the senators. They're not doing
their job. They are not waking up to the
significance of an issue that really is
the biggest story in human history and
should be the biggest issue of concern
before the Congress. If it is true that
technology recovered from nonhuman
beings is in the possession of private
aerospace companies and sections of the
US military and intelligence community.
That is the biggest story ever. It
should dominate the concerns and the
policy concerns of every legislature,
every representative, every senator in
Congress. And it's not. Why not? Because
they're being got at too. They're all a
bunch of self-interested corrupt swine.
A lot of them frankly I just find it
disgusting how corrupt American politics
is and how supine so many senators and
so many representatives are to the
intreaties of the private aerospace
industry and the national security
establishment. Um yes there are some
good honorable senators and
representatives and we all know who they
are. Uh Tim Burchchett, um Eric Bison
come to mind, um Anna Paulina Luna, um
these are good people doing their level
best as fairly junior representatives to
try and push back against the bulwick of
secrecy and conspiracy. Um yes, there is
a conspiracy to conceal this from the
public and at the moment they're
winning. So let's get those disclosure
laws passed and let's protect these
whistleblowers and let's get this
evidence before the Congress.
Okay, Russ, we have a question coming in
on X from Dave. He wants to know, "Hi,
Megan and Ross. What is your reaction to
the news mentioned earlier today by Ryan
Graves that Beatatric Viller's
fascinating paper on transients in Earth
in Earth orbit pre-1952
has been rejected by Arvix because it is
quote not of interest."
>> Okay, this is a complex issue. Actually
it's quite interesting bit of gossip
that Avix it's a technical paper
manuscript publication preprint preprint
publication platform and it was actually
created by DOE department of energy
scientists that that's the the guys from
the dark side by the way these are
probably people from the um the legacy
program uh at Los an uh Los Alamos
nuclear laboratories years and years ago
as a way of providing their papers in a
pre-print form before they were
published to their colleagues. And it's
turned into quite a useful way for
academics to share their papers and it's
probably the most gone to academic
citation reference platform in the
world. Now, um let's be very clear. Uh
Dr. Beatric Volarol has achieved what I
thought was the absolute impossible. she
has managed to achieve publication in a
peer-reviewed
platform which is part of the nature
group. I I think it's um scientific
papers which is part of the incredibly
prestigious nature platform uh published
by the Springer organization um to
achieve peer review for papers related
to UAPs or touching on the UAP subject
is mindblowingly momentous and
significant. It's a huge achievement.
But it does appear that from what Dr.
Villa Roll is saying [snorts] someone is
at the very least at Arvex which is also
used as a platform to get these things
out there. They're they're kind of
dragging their feet a little now. I'm
not sure if it's actually being blocked.
It Avix isn't actually a publication
platform. It's a pre print prep
pre-print platform for unpublished
manuscripts. Um, I mean, in the scheme
of things, this isn't really that
important because her two papers have
been published in prestigious scientific
journals, peer-reviewed journals, and to
get the authoritative stamp of a
platform that's within the Nature group
of companies, which has rigorous peer
review is quite something. It's a huge,
I think, turning point, tipping point in
the coverage of UAP related issues. Um
the problem is that ARVIX is where
physicists and astronomers share
preprints and if a paper is not there
it's almost it doesn't exist. It serves
as the central hub for open scientific
exchange where unpublished newly
accepted and even rejected manuscripts
is shared so that other researchers can
sort of read and test and build upon the
work. Now, um it looks like
um both of the accepted and
peer-reviewed papers have been rejected
from the ARVIX server and it from what
Beatric has told me in one case she was
told to replace an older work and the
other she was told that the research was
not of interest to Avix. Um she's made
the comment that empirical results, peer
review and publication in highquality
journals are no longer enough to satisfy
the gatekeepers. Scientists are being
prevented from reading new results. The
UFO stigma remains strong. And she
quoted Beatatric posted in her um tweet
she posted the ARVIC's response to one
paper which does appear to suggest that
they've refused to publish it. Thank you
for submitting your work to Avix. We
regret to inform you that Arvix's
moderators have determined that your
submission will not be accepted and made
public on arvix.org.
Our moderators determined that your
submission does not contain sufficient
original or substantive scholarly
research and is not of interest to
Arvex.
Um, now I think if that's the case, if
it really is Arvix making the
determination that this is not scholarly
research and not of interest, then
somebody on Arx is dragging their feet.
And you have to wonder, is this related
at all to the previous association with
um, Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratories and
the Department of Energy? Is there some
scientist with a stick up his ass inside
Artics who's trying to stop people
becoming aware of UAP related papers?
Um, if there is that kind of obstruction
or dragging of feet inside ARVIX, I
strongly suggest that they review their
decision because it's going to become a
major media issue if this kind of
obstruction continues.
>> Okay, Russ, we have a couple fun things
that we want to end with. Here is a
question from email our this is our
friend Daniel. Hey Ross, this is not a
UAP or NHI question, but what's with the
picture of the gorilla on the wall
behind you in the October 19th, 2025
reality check Q&A? Is there an
interesting story backstory to this?
Just curious. Thanks and keep up your
dogged investigations into the UAP
phenomena. Daniel in Virginia.
>> Oh, Daniel, I'd love to say it was some
s some some very clever literary
illusion. What it was was a bit of 1970s
kit in a uh beautiful motel in a
beautiful part of rural Australia where
I was doing some filming some research
for a future UAP related documentary.
And uh when I'm on the road, I can't
take my usual set with me. And so I used
a hotel room. You might have seen a
pillow on the bed there. I was in a
hotel room and uh that just happened to
be the most extraordinary photograph.
and I put it there as a bit of a joke to
see if anybody would notice and I'm glad
you did. But no, there's no UAP related
story to that. It's just a bit of fun.
>> It was a very cool picture.
>> But speaking of um gorillas, there
there's an interesting connection to
you, Megan, and I hope somebody's asked
you about that because I saw something
that you posted or reposted on Twitter
that I think you need to explain.
>> Yeah, I I love that you emailed this to
me. Um, I saw this when I logged into
work on Monday morning. There is an ex
account and it is called Bigfoot
Disclosure Diaries and um, I was
inspiration for one of their videos. I I
think it's best if we just roll it out.
>> Are you going to show it here? I hope
you do.
>> Why not?
>> What's up, guys? Foot here with the Q&A
lady. You're a breath of fresh air in
the UFO community, Megan. Not only do
you have sweet smelling perspirationfree
pits, you just throw your hands in the
air and wave them like you just don't
care. [laughter]
>> So that is I I presume that's very
clever use of AI. Is that the case?
>> Yes, correct. This is 100% AI. Um but
Ross, nothing to me screams you've made
it other than Bigfoot in your library
with you. So
>> how do we know? How do we know, Megan,
that that's not real and that you're
part of the cover up? That basically you
really do have a big foot in your living
room and and this is all part of Megan
or being responsible for the continuing
cover up about crypted creatures.
[laughter]
>> I can promise you this. If I was going
to use AI to make myself look really
cool, um the first thing I would not
have them say is that I have
perspirationfree pits. [laughter]
>> I did feel for you at that point. Yeah.
Um, it's interesting though because
>> I it's you looked great by the way, but
one thing I do want to point out is that
is a good illustration of just how
incredibly clever AI is becoming and why
we at Reality Check have to be
incredibly scrupulously careful with any
kind of video or imagery that's provided
to us by people of purported UAP or
paranormal objects. I I must get every
day two or three clearly AI generated
images. And what gives them away often
is that they are just so realistic, so
hyper realistic. And I I don't know how
we're going to fix this because a as AI
gets better and better. It's only a
matter of time before convincing AI UAP
imagery gets put into the public domain
only eventually to be debunked. I'm just
wondering whether there's a case to be
argued that the AI companies that
provide these technologies should
perhaps be required to put some kind of
blockchain signature into their AI
algorithms so that one can automatically
define whether something is an AI
generated image or not because this is a
huge issue. I mean, if somebody can fake
a Bigfoot with you, Megan, they can make
a politician look like they're taking a
bribe or caught in an in a compromising
sexual position or something like that.
And and it can be used for um public
exposure and vilification. So, there's a
reason why we do need to be able to
verify imagery. And your experience with
Bigfoot is a great example.
