After visiting the tridactyl corpses and
seeing the problems the researchers at
the University of Eeka face with the
Peruvian government, do you notice how
similar it is to the issues in the US
disclosure effort except for there the
conflict is over physical evidence, not
whistleblowers?
>> Okay, Godzel, let me be very clear. At
first, um, I was very, very skeptical
about the so-called tridactyl beings,
objects being real beings, because like
a lot of people, I'd swallowed
particularly the Reuters news report,
which suggested that there were
artificial toys, hoax objects that had
been intercepted at an airport on their
way out of Peru. and it put a stink over
the whole thing that quite frankly
suggested to me remotely that there was
something very smelly or suspicious
about these objects. Having seen them
for myself, I can't reach at this stage
a definitive conclusion. But what I can
tell my viewers and listeners is I do
not think these are hoax objects. I do
not think that they are some kind of
constructed artificial object. The scans
and indeed the visual inspections that
we were allowed to do in three separate
locations of three separate groups of
beings blew me away. Frankly, they are
real. Whatever they are,
