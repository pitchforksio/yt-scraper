Good day and welcome back to Reality
Check. I'm your host, Ross Kulart. Well,
what an interesting time it is right now
around the world with mystery objects.
Perhaps they are craft or drones.
Perhaps not. But whatever they are, they
are breaching highly protected national
airspace over major airports and
sensitive military facilities with
apparent impunity. Currently, it's
Denmark and Norway. Previously, of
course, earlier this year, it was the
United States and Great Britain. Now,
the long taboo subject of unidentified
anomalous phenomena is increasingly
becoming an issue of mainstream
political concern.
It's impossible yet to say what these
objects are, but their apparent capacity
to hover in position for hours, far
longer than offthe-shelf normal
commercial or military drones, suggests
a highly advanced professional actor,
perhaps a foreign state adversary. But
there's no evidence yet of which
country, if any, is responsible to date.
These drones are also showing apparent
stealth capabilities. They quite
literally just appear over often highly
secure facilities without showing up on
radar even though they're very large in
many cases. And if they are
radiocontrolled
unmanned craft, they're not receiving
signals on any known frequency that
anyone I've spoken to has been able to
detect. In the US, they've also
apparently been able to change shape on
occasion, making themselves appear to
look like aircraft with jet or turbine
noises, but they're moving impossibly
slowly at extremely low altitude.
They're also not hiding themselves at
all, displaying flashing lights and
often pulsing up, emitting a bright glow
as they move. often erratically through
the sky.
Whatever these are, they're not ordinary
drones, if they're drones at all. Now,
while the United States, Britain, and
other Western countries, including my
own here in Australia, have at times
given wildly contradictory explanations
for whatever these objects are. Some
governments are taking the possibility
the possibility that these so-called
drones might be some kind of
unidentified anomalous phenomena very
seriously indeed. In late September
2025, I was approached by a Japanese
online TV network called Niko Niko
asking me if I was interested in
interviewing a two times former Japanese
defense minister, Mr. Yasu Kazu Hamada
in a live TV appearance with two other
members of the Japanese Parliament, The
Diet, the UFO Diet Members League. In
May, this new parliamentary UFO group in
Japan submitted a proposal to the
current Japanese Defense Minister,
General Nakatani, on UAPs.
They called for the establishment of an
office specializing in UAP issues at the
Japanese Ministry of Defense and for the
collection, investigation, and analysis
of UAP information. They requested
information sharing with the United
States, periodic reporting back to the
diet, the Parliament, and public
disclosure.
Its primary purpose was to demand that
the Japanese government tackle UAPs
headon as a genuine authentic security
issue. It's extremely noteworthy that
this UFO league isn't comprised by a
bunch of fringe politicians. Mr. Hamada
himself has been the defense minister of
Japan in two previous administrations
and the current prime minister of Japan,
Mr. Shagiru Ishibbo, no less, has joined
the UFO diet members league. It's quite
extraordinary. The prime minister is a
member of the UFO parliamentary group
and he has expressed a belief in UFOs
previously and he said he's looking at
how Japan's military should respond to
the possibility of aliens under Japan's
pacifist constitution.
quote, he said, "There are no grounds
for us to deny that there are
unidentified flying objects and some
life form that controls them." He's
previously said.
So, when I was offered this unique
opportunity to question Mr. Yasu Kazu
Hamada, the chairman of Japan's UFO Diet
Members League, and another former
politician, Mr. Yoshiharu Asakawa on
this live debate program. I leapt at the
opportunity. One of the issues we
discussed was an incident that took
place on the 26th of July this year over
the Genkai nuclear power plant in
Kyushu, Japan, where three mysterious
lights were observed lingering for an
extended period. As you'll hear, the
Japanese authorities also initially
suggested these might be drones, but
there's still a mystery about what these
objects were.
>> It's great to meet you again.
It's nice to be back and it's an honor
to meet the parliamentarians who have
been responsible for the creation of the
UFO parliamentary league. It's a very
important step for Japan.
>> May I ask where you are now? I
>> I'm in Australia uh very near to Sydney.
I live very close to the city of Sydney.
So thank you for being here so late at
night in your time. Uh now I will give
you the segment this segment of this
program to you. So please feel free to
interview representative Hamada.
Can I firstly say to Representative Yasu
Kazu Hamada how honored I am to be able
to interview him for uh the TV network
that I work for in the uh in America in
the United States. I'm a correspondent
for News Nation which is a cable news
network in the United States.
Can I firstly ask you sir,
what is the feeling inside the Japanese
government generally about the issue of
UAPs?
Is it taken seriously by the government
or is it like in Australia the
government doesn't think about it at
all?
So in our so part of our activities was
to make a recommendation to the defense
department and I believe that uh
minister uh the defense minister and
also the defense ministry are very
serious and they are very seriously
making effort on this issue but I do
feel that there's a difference in the
how serious uh we are so between the
members of the parliament parliament
members of the national diet and the and
people within the government and I
actually think that they are not very
proactive in their effort. So we think
that we parliamentarians need to make
more effort.
Well, firstly, can I say I think it's
very admirable that Japan is showing
such leadership on this issue because by
definition, any unidentified object
entering the airspace of any country is
a threat to national security and flight
safety. So, it's to be commended that
Japan is doing this.
Can I uh can I please ask what has
prompted the strength of feeling in the
parliament? Uh I'm very surprised that
for example the prime minister of Japan
Shingiru Ishiba was involved as a
founding member of your group.
What is it in the issue of UAPs that has
caused such a serious response from
politicians in Japan? Why are so many
strong leaders in Japan in the
parliament so keen to see action on
UAPs? What is the history that has led
to this political initiative?
Prime Minister Isha is still our top
council or advisor.
uh and he is someone uh he is a
politician who has been uh doing a lot
of work in the national defense and
national security and he had dealt with
many issues uh from the perspective of
national security and for example he
said what if Godzilla came came then how
would we deal with Godzilla then in such
a case we all so need to be prepared
prepared because we politicians need to
be expect the unexpected
and in case of UAP it's very important
that the fact the very important fact is
that we don't know what they are and the
fact that we don't know what they are is
something that makes us should make us
anxious we need to be prepared
uh for uh all possible also not very
unexpected possibilities
And Mr. Ishiba is someone who had such a
philos political philosophy.
>> During your time as defense minister,
were you ever briefed about UAPs about
unexplained incursions into Japanese
airspace that were not able to be
explained in any way whatsoever? Did you
ever have any contact with the Americans
about UAPs?
>> There was no official communication that
was reported to me.
>> There's been no time in your history as
defense minister that any report has
been made by any of the military or
civilian services about unidentified
objects entering Japanese airspace.
>> Is that correct?
there was no official such report
uh when I served as the minister of
defense.
>> That's very interesting. The US
government of course has publicly
admitted that UAPs are a genuine mystery
worthy of serious investigation.
This means they acknowledge that there
are anomalous objects
in some cases apparently intelligently
controlled and they're operating in our
skies in our oceans and they cannot be
explained apparently as human technology
or normal natural phenomena.
Do you agree sir with that analysis by
the United States? Is is the position of
your time as a defense minister such
that you think that the United States
government is correct in that analysis
that there is a genuine mystery worthy
of investigation?
In our self-defense forces uh there is a
category called unidentified object
or nonidentifiable object and but uh we
don't know if the object there uh
reported in this uh category were uh
intelligently controlled as I understand
they were most reported as uh natural
phenomena.
for example uh for example a group of
nine B flock of B.
Um but I know that the defense ministry
is working together closely with the US
government and because we have not made
any attempt to analyze the information
independently of them uh we cannot say
much about this topic but uh I I have
been reported that they are actually
working with the US government and
sharing information.
>> That that was my next question. I was
going to ask whether you are aware if
there is any collaboration or on
gathering or investigating incidents of
unidentified objects. It sounds like
you're saying that there is
collaboration with the United States.
That's very interesting because the all
domain anomaly resolution office, the
Pentagon's UFO office, has testified to
Congress that it intends to reach out to
allies like Japan and indeed Australia
to ask for assistance in gathering
information on UAPs.
Can I please clarify? Is the
collaboration you are talking about a
request from the United States for
information to be kept by the defense
ministry on UAPs?
>> Could you please repeat the last
question? So you said please clarify the
collaboration.
>> Sure. I I'm particularly keen. I think
it's very significant that the defense
ministry is assisting the Americans and
collaborating on collecting of data.
What I'm keen to know is is that
collaboration because the Americans have
asked Japan to assist with providing
information on unidentified objects.
And so uh this kind of uh sharing of
information is not uh restricted to UAP
related matters and uh it's not that I
have heard directly that they have
shared the the US government has asked
us or maybe we have asked them uh to
share information about UAPs. Uh so such
concrete report is not something that I
know of.
>> The defense department in the United
States has said in a report that Japan
is a hot spot for UFO UAP sightings. Uh
they said this in about August 2023 in a
report tabled in Congress. Do do you
know why Japan is such a hot spot?
Clearly from what you're telling me,
it's not reports from military. Uh there
are a lot of civilians in Japan who are
reporting UFOs.
So the uh places that the US military
has the uh the US uh the department
defense department has designated as hot
spot are the areas where uh the US
military are very actively
deployed and also these are the areas
where they are very tense situations. So
the US military activities in volume and
also in their activity range are very
high in the sky and also in the on over
the ocean. And so uh the Japanese
self-defense forces uh have officially
said that there is no
case that should be made in public. So
that's the official position. So, uh,
that's what I think that might be the
case.
>> Can I suggest, sir, that that that
suggests to me that the Americans are
seeing things around Japan from their
bases and perhaps they are not sharing
that information with your government.
If if is there any other explanation as
to why the Americans would know that
Japan is a UFO hotspot? Because if it's
not information coming from the Ministry
of Defense, if it's not coming from
civilians,
as you say, it must be coming from the
US military bases in Japan. It it makes
me wonder is America not sharing that
intelligence with Japan and if that is
the case is that a concern to you?
>> So uh we can think that the Americans
have the high awareness and also the
ability to detect such object. Um but
it's up to Americans to decide if such
information is necessary uh for us for
Japanese and to be shared with the
Japanese.

In November 1986, a Japan Airlines cargo
plane flight 1628
encountered a massive UFO UAP while
flying near Alaska. Three UFOs played
tag with this cargo plane for 50 minutes
while they were observed by the
sometimes terrified flight crew. During
the last 30 minutes, the objects were
tracked on radar. The cargo planes
Captain Kenji Tarachi described the main
so-called mother ship object as being
two times the size of an aircraft
carrier hovering in the sky. It was
shaped like a walnut with a very wide
brim. an official of the United States
Federal Aviation Administration, a very
senior official, John Callahan, who was
then an FAA division chief, personally
investigated the incident. He confirmed
the Alaskan radar evidence did show an
anomaly. He went public with his
allegations that America's external
intelligence agency, the CIA, the
Central Intelligence Agency, tried to
suppress this incident by confiscating
all data from the sighting, fearing it
would cause mass panic if the public
learned that UFOs were real.
This is John Callahan's story and this
is the questions that I put to the
Japanese politicians about it.
There is a very important case where a
Japan Airlines plane uh flight 1628 was
flying from Paris to Narita airport in
November 1986.
And it's a very famous case because the
captain of the plane, Kenji Taroshi,
reported seeing three objects, two small
ships and a gigantic mother ship, a a
UFO mother ship hovering near his
aircraft. And I'm aware that the uh
Federal Aviation Administration
uh in America, an official named John
Callahan, he was the FAA
division chief of the accidents and
investigation branch in Washington DC. a
very senior official of the FAA,
he became aware that there were radar
tapes that had recorded these objects on
radar and the US military had apparently
recorded these objects and that radar
data was provided to the FAA by the
Anchorage Alaska air traffic control.
It's interesting because I'm wondering
whether the minister is aware of this
case because what it shows I felt sorry
for Captain Tarouchi because he was
given a difficult time for speaking
publicly about his sighting and
allegedly the CIA, the American
Intelligence Service intervened
according to John Callahan to try to
confiscate all of the radar tapes, but
Mr. Callahan kept a copy and provided it
to the public and eventually it was made
public.
Th this is a disturbing case because it
suggests that the intelligence agencies
of the United States are trying to
suppress evidence even when a good
person like Captain Tarachi comes
forward with evidence of a UFO.
It it worries me. Is the minister sorry
is is the former defense minister Mr.
Hamada, are you are you concerned at all
that your American allies are perhaps
not being fully open with Japan as much
as they should be?
So this is not something that happened
during my time as uh serving as a uh
defense minister and unfortunately I
don't have uh I have I had not heard of
the possibility of American intelligence
or agency involved in this and so and
also I don't know much I don't know
enough about this case to make a
comment. So I'd like uh Mr. uh to talk
about this. Thank you.
So this is something that happened in
1986 and I was at the time a high school
student and I remember that a very
quality Japanese newspaper uh Asaki
newspaper
uh has the deal with the issue by just
saying that it was a a mistaken case of
the sighting of Jupiter.
And that was a very memorable incident
and also uh people asked me about this
incident in Mexico when I visited the
congress and also at soul when I visited
them last year. So this is a very famous
a world famous incident. So um I asked
the government when I was a member of
the national diet if they have any
information regarding this and they said
simply no
disclosure
>> and as you pointed out this case uh more
details about this case was revealed at
the event by the disclosure project and
uh so I think that that this case also
proves that UFO four issues are a very
important and significant
uh political and military or national
security problem.
>> Uh maybe we can we could say that that
was some kind of the newest weapon at
the time developed by another country
but when we think of the technology at
the time it's very unlikely.
or or
>> so um whether the uh whether the
information regarding this issue is
still in the government uh preserved is
uh we I don't think that that is likely
uh but uh if we have witness testimony
and also uh maybe the data from the US
government we can reexamine this issue
and it's it's not good uh that we leave
something that is unknown just as
unknown. So we personally I think that
we should work on it.
>> Music to my ears, sir. Thank you very
much for your answer. I I'd like to move
on now to the Genkai nuclear power plant
incident in July. I noticed that the
police have made the finding that these
objects were high alitude aircraft.
But my reading of local news reports
suggests that not everyone agrees with
that analysis. Uh does representative
Hamada or anybody in the panel have a
view as to whether the finding that
these were just high alitude aircraft to
explain the luminous lights seen over
the Genkai nuclear power plant? Does
that meet your expectations? Do you do
you concur? Do you agree with that
finding?
I believe that when something like this
happens, uh the question whether we at
the government uh are prepared to
respond is questioned. And as you know,
we have had a special hearing uh on
August uh 7th and we talked with the
Kushu power uh power power company and
we also from the officials of the
related uh ministries and agencies and
we will actually talk about this later
uh in this program and then you you can
also figure out what actually are
problems with this incident and this is
an issue that many people are interested
in not just members of the
parliamentary.
[Music]
On March the 11th, 2001, a powerful
earthquake and a subsequent tsunami
disabled the Fukushima Dai nuclear power
plant in Japan, leading to the meltdown
of three reactor cores and the release
of large amounts of radioactive
material. A huge area was and remains
evacuated. There was extensive
contamination of the surrounding land
and sea. Around about 10,000 people were
evacuated. The accident was classified
as a level seven event, the highest
possible on the international nuclear
and radiological event scale. It
signified a major release of radioactive
material with widespread health and
environmental effects.
I was intrigued by reports at the time
from Japanese media and civilians with
mobile phones who suggested that around
the time of the Fukushima meltdown in
2011, large numbers of people, including
TV media witnesses saw UFO orbl like
objects over or near the critical
reactor meltdown site. There was this
video published online showing multiple
white dot orbs hovering over or near the
plant. By way of background, there were
similar sightings also at the time of
the Chernobyl nuclear plant meltdown in
Ukraine in the Soviet Union in April
1986.
The former Soviet official newspaper
Pravda reported that hundreds of people
witnessed a UFO hovering over the
Chernobyl plant for roughly 6 hours
during the disaster.
It even reported claims that the UFO
might have been responsible for a
significant reduction of the radiation
levels released by the destroyed
reactor. I was intrigued to know if this
former Japanese defense minister had
ever heard such claims about Fukushima.
[Music]
One of the reasons I'm very interested
in the Genkai case, sir, is because it
has been reported that there was an
earthquake in the Saga Prefecture at 900
p.m. that evening, just 3 and 1/2 hours
before the sighting. Uh
the the earthquake hit. Um there was an
earthquake at 900 p.m. on the Saturday
evening.
Um and there were reports over the
facility at Fukushima as well of craft
uh over the uh Fukushima facility. And
I'm just wondering whether there's any
possibility that there is a link here
with earthquake phenomena. Uh, have you
considered the possibility that what we
are talking about is some kind of
non-human intelligence being concerned
about nuclear power plants possibly
being under threat from earthquakes in a
place like Japan where obviously there
is a great deal of seismic activity.
So I' I have heard that there could be
some kind of light uh as a natural
phenomena when earthquake happened. Uh
but we don't know if this these UAPs
were be had any relationship with the
earthquake. Um so about regarding the
nuclear uh Fukushima uh nuclear reactors
and UAPs. Uh so they say that they have
seen UAPs on TV
camera and I actually know someone a
journalist who has been there and filmed
the UAPs and also had seen them uh with
his own eyes. Uh I'm but I'm not sure if
we can uh think about this and the
Genkai incident at the same level. Uh
but I'm aware that ARO has uh said that
there is some kind of there might be
some kind of relationship between
nuclear facilities and UAPs.
>> There certainly is. That's very
interesting. That's a very interesting
answer. Um I'm very interested in that.
Can I ask uh Mr. Hammada,
is there any mandatory
reporting system for pilots in the
defense force or civilian aircraft?
Is there any requirement that UAPs be
reported? One of the big problems in
America, I have found this as a
journalist, is many military people feel
that it would damage their career to
come forward with a sighting of a UAP.
So, they often see these objects, but
they don't report them. Uh, is there a
mandatory reporting requirement for UAPs
in place in Japan? And if not, do you
think that that would be a good
initiative for the defense ministry to
follow?
>> For the civilian pilots, there's no such
mandatory system for self-defense for
pilots belonging to self-defense forces.
There are variety of uh report systems
and they are mandatory and uh according
to the ministry in charge of uh
transportation
at this point there is no such uh worry.
So that will be my answer but Mr. now
says that I should read out some uh the
PowerPoint that he's now showing to you.
Oh, good.
So, in uh 2020 September
uh Taro Kono who was at the time uh
defense minister
has
made a special order. He had directed
the self-defense forces
how to respond to UAPs
and that is uh so there are three points
uh they should make sure that uh there
are that these cases are reported that's
the first point and the second point is
uh as far as possible they should try to
make a photo or try to make some kind of
record and the third point is they
should analyze
the cases.
>> Can I ask just to double check I I
wanted to be clear. So even though they
have those rules, the mandatory
reporting rules for military pilots, is
it the case that to your knowledge there
have been no such reports made by any
military pilots since those rules were
made?
>> When I was a member, Mr. Sakawa says
when he was a member of the national
diet, he asked some questions to the
defense minister Hamada and also defense
minister Kihara and he had received a
very epoch making uh answer. One of the
officials of the defense ministry had
said there is nothing that we could
share with the uh public at this point.
So that suggests to me, sir, there is
data. They're just not letting the
public know about it. Is that correct?
So I've received this answer after many
questions and um so my understanding is
that they're saying that there might be
or would be something that could be uh
publicized or uh shared with the general
public when uh certain conditions
uh
are there.
And this is actually related to the
Chinese balloon uh incident in
Tohoku.
>> So the defense ministry and the
self-defense forces knew that there were
Chinese balloons,
reconnaissance balloons, but they
ignored because they didn't want people
to know that they have the ability to
detect them.
uh according to his own understanding
they didn't want to lie. Uh the official
said that it's not something that at
this point we cannot answer but maybe we
will be able to answer later in some
future.
>> Thank you for that very interesting
answer. Very interesting.
We have uh five minutes left now. So if
uh please keep asking questions if they
are important questions.
>> Can I please ask both Mr. Hamada and Mr.
Esakawa individually?
Do either of you have a view as to
whether you believe that this planet is
or has been visited by a nonhuman
intelligence?
What do you think of the likelihood that
we have been visited by a nonhuman
intelligence?
And do you think there is any good
reason why? If governments somewhere do
know about them, should we know about
them or is there a good reason to keep
it secret? If you knew about it, would
you tell the public?
>> We need to understand what is visible
right in front of our eyes. And there
are possible things and uh unlikely
things. But when there are things that
we have not been able to see uh that are
increasingly being seen by us uh maybe
we need to admit it.
uh but if it is possible that such there
is such existence then that is something
that we need to investigate and in our
UAP uh parliamentary league such things
should be our main concerns and if we so
we should we need to confirm we need to
investigate and if we can confirm farm
we should be able to share and we are uh
willing to share the information
and uh Mr. about another and he says
that uh we are surrounded by China and
Russia and North Korea and these
countries are uh more hostile to us
seemingly than the space aliens.
>> Very good point.
Yeah,
>> Japan is a UAP hot spot and it's
possible that these countries will send
us also some kind of reconcil.
So we think that uh it is important to
be alert and to collect information and
we need to have one place where this
information can be collected and
analyzed and we need to create laws to
make uh such changes in our government.
And we need to collect information from
civilian pilots as well. And uh we need
to find out if these objects are from uh
uh hostile uh countries or maybe from
the outer space.
>> Well, I I thank the honorable
representatives for their answers and
can I say I very much admire the fact
that Japan has created this UAP
parliamentary league. It's a very
important step and I think you are
showing a progressive initiative that is
way ahead of Australia and I think even
some in Congress. I I think you are
shining a light for other countries and
I very much admire I know a lot of
people would show great respect for the
efforts that Japan's politicians are
making to get to the truth of this very
interesting mystery. Thank you so much
gentlemen for your kindness in giving me
this time.
>> He has a final suggestion. Maybe someday
news nation and Niko Niko can together
have a joint project where uh
politicians from the United States and
from Japan can gather together and
discuss UAP issues.
>> I love that idea because something tells
me that it will be the Japanese
politicians who are holding the American
politicians feet to the fire. I think
you guys are way ahead of the Americans.
They have their head very much in the
sand in Congress. I'm sorry to say.
>> Maybe the US Congress is already
assuming the existence of NHIS.
>> I think there are some there are
definitely some good politicians in
Congress who are trying to get to the
truth. But sadly, we have learned today
that yet another year is going to happen
where the laws that we need to be passed
to allow greater disclosure before the
Congress. They have been blocked once
again by the same people in the Congress
who do not want this story to be
investigated. It's it's very frustrating
because there are many good people in
Congress. There is an oversight
committee led by Representative Anna
Paulina Luna. It has members like
Representative Eric Berles who I know
has spoken to your group before. It also
has Representative Tim Burchett and they
are doing good work to try to get to the
truth. Unfortunately, there are some in
Congress and they have the numbers who
are trying to stop this story from being
properly investigated. I think maybe it
will take leadership from Japan to get
this story out.
>> Mr. Thank you very much. uh and I have
recognized in this program that maybe I
do not I do not have uh I still do I
still need to learn more about these
issues and I'd be very happy to work
with you again.
>> We would be honored to collaborate with
your TV network. It would be good fun.
We can both try to find out the truth.
Thanks for joining us for what was an
intriguing opportunity to question a
two-time former Japan defense minister
about his interest in the UFO mystery. I
know the Japanese politicians who are
members of this Japanese parliamentary
UFO league want to liaz with other
politicians around the world to share
information and help develop protocols
for how to respond to this mystery.
Exciting too that the Japanese prime
minister, the existing prime minister is
himself a member of this UFO league.
Such remarkable cander and transparency
on the UAP issue is to be commended. And
maybe countries like Australia, the US,
and other Western nations struggling
with this ongoing drone mystery could
take a leaf from Japan's book. We'll
keep you posted on developments. And if
you'd like to ask me any questions in
our weekly Q&A, you can get hold of me
at reality checks
