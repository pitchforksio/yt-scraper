Hello and welcome to Reality Check. I'm
Ross Kulart and what a week it's been.
Very, very busy indeed. Of course, this
show we're going to focus very strongly
on the interview I did with Lou Alzando,
the former Pentagon UFO investigator
and his book Imminent. And we're
bringing my good friend and colleague
Merrick von Renenampamp in to help me do
the analysis. But before we roll Merrick
in, I do want to talk about the breaking
news of the appointment of a new ARO
director. This is the Pentagon's UFO UAP
investigation office, ARO, the all
domain anomaly resolution office and the
interim director since October 2023.
since Dr. Sha Kirkpatrick departed has
been Tim Phillips and he's now been
announced by the Defense Department to
be being replaced by a Dr. John T.
Coslosski who's come to us from the
National Security Agency. And I have to
say Dr. John Klosski is extremely well
spoken of by people I respect and admire
in the UAP field. People say he's very
very genuine about bringing a new
approach to Arrow. Not that he's
hyperritical of his predecessors, but
that he does want to try and restore
public confidence in Arrow after frankly
what has been months of turmoil. One of
the first tests of Dr. John T. Kosowski,
of course, is going to be whether he
retains Dr. Sean Kirkpatre in the rather
unusual role he's had as a kind of
semicconsultant to Arrow where he's been
commenting in his role as a former
director of Arrow and being given I
think undue emphasis I think because of
his past role as a director of Arrow. So
it'll be very very interesting to see
whether Dr. Sha Kirkpatrick is kept on
in that role by Ksowski. But what I can
tell you about Ksowski is he's pretty
impressive. He comes from the NSA, which
is of course one of America's premier
spy agencies. He's been involved in what
sounds like incomprehensibly complicated
research, leading missionoriented
research in the fields of networking and
computing. He's a subject matter expert
in the area of free space optics,
whatever that is, advising various DoD
agencies. In addition to his optics
research and crypto mathematics, Dr.
Ksowski invented an advanced language
agnostic search engine and served at the
DoD special communications enterprise
office. I have no idea what that means.
I I took a peek earlier at two patents
that Dr. Kosowski has patented and found
them so incomprehensible I'm not even
going to try and tell you what they are.
He's got a bachelor's degree in
mathematics and physics from California
State University, San Bernardino, and a
PhD in electrical engineering from John
Hopkins University.
And just to give you a summary of his
work, the focus of his doctoral research
was the invention of novel devices that
leverage principles from quantum optics
to receive very weak phase encoded
signals.
clear as mud. Well, what I can tell you
that does make sense is Klosski is very
well spoken of by people who want change
and wanted a greater degree of
transparency and openness by the
Pentagon. And frankly, whilst I'm not a
huge fan of Arrow and I've been very
critical of Arrow, I think this is
potentially a very positive move and uh
it's going to I think be incumbent on
all of us to give Dr. Cosloski a chance.
Let's show him good faith and let's see
how he moves. By the way, if anybody
wants a job, I noticed that there's also
a ARO deputy chief of staff going. You
can be based in Virginia, Alexandria,
and you would be the chief of staff for
Arrow and uh you'd have a top secret SCI
clearance.
So, if anybody wants the job, it's up on
the um up on the ODNI.gov
website, ARO Chief of Staff. Start date
20th of October. So, it looks like
they're hiring, which is good news. Now,
before we get into this week's show, I
want to also show you an interview
section that we didn't run in the Lou
Alzando interview purely and simply
because of time. A lot of folk have been
asking me why Lou Alzando made no
comment about David Grush. And before
the rumor mill starts, can I say Lou
spoke extremely highly of David Grush
and the decision not to include the
particular comment that I'm about to
show you in the program was purely and
simply made because of time. But a lot
of folk I think have attached a lot of
importance to the fact that there was no
mention of David Grush in the Lou
Alzando interview. So, I thought it
would be important for people to see
just how highly Lou Alzando regards
David Grush and how he shares the
traviles and the pain that David Grush
has been through for being a
whistleblower. David of course is the
guy that I interviewed in June last year
for NewsNation when he went public as a
former very senior intelligence officer
formerly with the National Geospatial
Intelligence Agency. speaking about his
knowledge of a retrieval and reverse
engineering program involving UAPs.
Here's what Lou Alzando said. This is a
dangerous battle you're fighting, Lou.
There are forces, powerful forces, that
don't want this story told.
>> Oh, yeah. And they'll go to great
lengths to to to keep it keep it a
secret. Look what happened to poor Dave.
You know, I worked with David Space
Force. I don't know if that's public
knowledge, but I'll say what the hell.
He and I were working the UAP topic for
Space Force for a very good man, a
senior guy, very senior guy, by the way.
And this is all in the open. So, I mean,
this was this is acknowledged at the
time. And um he did the right thing. You
know, a lot of our our service men and
women suffer deeply from PTSD.
And until recently, we were always told,
you know, it can affect your security
clearance. Don't don't seek
psychological help. And then something
happened. somebody who I respected quite
a bit and and thankfully it was it was
General Clapper when he became the DNI
said we're not going to hold our men and
women anymore responsible if they go and
seek mental counseling and they
self-referral because of PTSD the
horrible things that they have to endure
in combat they should not be penalized
from their security clearance right so
what happened with Dave Bruce when he
did the right thing he did exactly what
he was supposed to do
some nitnoid reporter gets information
from none other than who people from
inside the government to say, "H,
they've had had had counseling." Well,
wait a minute. That's exactly what you
want someone to do if they need it
because the suicide rate for our men and
women in uniform is through the roof.
And you know what? No one seems to
really give a So this is why we had to
change the policy. So for David doing
the right thing, the very first thing he
does within 24 hours, they start seing
dissension and they start misinformation
and trying to question his loyalty and
his credibility. David Grouch is a
patriot. And in my book, he's he he's a
damn fine human being and a hero for
what he did. And what was his reward
from that? What was his reward for that?
Immediately the antibodies came out and
they try to discredit him just like they
try to do me. just like they try to
anybody else who comes out and steps out
of out of rank.
>> So, as you can see, a glowing
endorsement from Lou Alzando for David
Grush. Now, let's move on to today's
show. And boy, we've got a lot ahead of
us. Here we go.
Lou sat down with me last Friday and
gave a very detailed one- on-one
interview which ran in prime time on
NewsNation. and we've had an
overwhelming response. And in order to
do the analysis of that show and follow
up on some of the issues that Lou
raised, I'm bringing in Marik von
Renenamp who's a former uh national
security adviser to the State Department
and a Obama administration appointee to
the Pentagon, the Department of Defense.
But before I bring Mark in, I I want to
tell you about a product that happily is
sponsoring reality check and which also
addresses some of the egregious food
that you Americans happen to eat and
it's all about the gut cleanse biomplete
3. Uh the the theory that is pushed by
the gut cleanse Biocomplete 3 product is
that there is a potential toxin in all
of the quote healthy foods that
scientists have been telling us to eat
with a fraudulent food pyramid for some
considerable time. Um, one day I will do
a story on reality check about the
American ultrarocessed food diet and why
I fear for this beautiful country that
it seems to be suffering from the
appalling food that it eats and it needs
a fix. Well, maybe that fix is the gut
cleanse biomplete 3. There's a Dr.
Gundry, a world-renowned cardiologist
who is saying that is there's a
potential toxin in our food that's
causing huge digestive issues and it's
affecting millions of people worldwide.
The warning signs include weight gain,
fatigue, digestive disorder, stiff
joints, even skin problems. And Dr.
Gundry explains that these side effects
are often mistaken for normal signs of
aging because digestive issues develop
usually over a matter of years and
sometimes even decades. And I can assure
you that the damage that we're talking
about is probably caused by these
supposed health foods and it's far from
normal. The good news is you can fix
this problem from your own home. It's
very simple. You just have to know which
foods are actually healthy and which
contain this hidden potential toxin. So
you can find this yourself at the gut
cleanse protocol.com/
ross. That's gutcleansprotocol.com/ros.
[Music]
And if you go there, you'll find that
after years of research, Dr. Gundry has
decided to release an informative video
to the public for free. and it's
uninterrupted showcasing exactly which
foods you need to avoid. Go find that
video at gut cleansprotocol.com/
ross and click on the link in the
description below. Okay, let's get into
the show. Marik von Renamp, welcome to
reality check, sir. How are you today?
What did you think of the Lou Alzando
special we put to air last week?
>> Well, Ross, first of all, thank you very
much for having me on. Um, and
congratulations on another extraordinary
interview that in my mind really pushes
this conversation forward. And um I'll
just quickly kind of at the outset state
that um your interview Lou's book really
makes the case for why we need Congress
to pass the legislation that it's before
it that would get to the bottom of these
explosive allegations that we're hearing
from multiple individuals. So Ross,
congratulations. You did a superb job.
Um and love to dive into the details
with you.
So, I should explain that Marrick is
very much a journalist in his own right.
He's a he's a contributing uh
commentator for The Hill, which is a uh
sister publication with the um the
network that we all belong to, the
Nextar Network. And Merrick, I love your
pieces. If we're going to give each
other a mutual admiration society, I I
think everybody should read the Hill
contributions made by Merrick because he
adds a depth and a contribution to the
issue that frankly in television we're
not able to do quite often. I do agree
with you that Lou's contribution was
significant and I think the the passing
of the legislation that's coming up in
the National Defense Authorization Act
at the end of this year is going to be
absolutely crucial. I have to admit I'm
not optimistic. I'm I'm a bit grim. Uh
having been in Washington to shoot the
Lou interview and seen what Lou is up
against. The very few people like Lu
Alzando are up against on the hill is a
very determined uh cadra of gatekeepers
in the defense aerospace industry,
frankly Merrick, who just do not want
this story told. And uh I just want you
to have a look at this clip. This was an
exchange that I had with Lou uh
basically with the Congress as a
backdrop and uh intriguingly with the
Smithsonian Science Museum which I
thought was quite apt as as a as a
background as well. And we were talking
about how reluctantly he's become very
much the face of the UAP issue. So Lou,
when you first started out in this
campaign, I mean, it was back in 2008,
you first heard of UFOs. You had no idea
about the phenomenon, did you?
>> No clue. Not at all. Never even thought
about it.
>> And yet, what was it? 9 years later,
2017. You were the public face of a New
York Times story that rocked the world.
>> One of the public faces, not the public
face. Look, this was this has always
been a team effort. It strikes me, Lou,
you're a very humble person. You are
very much the reluctant hero in this
campaign, aren't you?
>> Look, I it can't be about me,
>> right? You know, I'm doing this so you
can think on your own. Don't don't rely
on me, on Lou Alzando, to tell you what
to think. That's that's the exact
opposite of what I'm trying to achieve.
I'm trying to enable everyone, the
American people, these folks up here.
That's what my goal is.
>> So, you want people to get up there and
start asking questions if they're
Congress people?
>> Absolutely. Absolutely. And I got to
tell you, there's people right now in
that building that are very keen to get
to the bottom of this and they're
committed. I mean, these are on both
sides, both Republican and Democrat and
even independent. This is this is truly
a bipartisan issue. Any thoughts on what
Lou's just said to us there, Merrick?
Well, Ross, um first of all, I want to
highlight that um this is and as Lou
made very clear, this is one of perhaps
the only issues or one of very few
issues that is truly bipartisan in a
deeply divided country and in a
politically fractured nation. So, um I I
do want to highlight I know I know uh uh
there is some pessimism about the uh
legislation that is in front of
Congress, but I do want to highlight
that perhaps maybe u you know be
highlight the positive and the the more
optimistic side of of this and that is
that um this has united the the all of
the kind of different factions in
American politics whether it is uh
Democrats, the more um MAGA Trump
Republicans and more moderate Republic
Republicans. Um we've seen a a
remarkable kind of coalescing around the
the the members of Congress who are
interested in this. Um and and we really
need to see um more step up and become
more vocal. But um Lou's right. Um you
know there there is certainly um a lot
of work ahead, but it is a bipartisan
issue and that deserves uh a closer look
and uh certainly some analysis and
examination.
I think the thing that sticks out for me
is Lou is, as he acknowledges, he's
quite a humble guy. He doesn't like
being the focus of attention. But the
reality is what really struck me when I
was filming with him over several days
in DC. He's under incredible pressure
and the decision that he made as, you
know, a very senior serving employee of
the defense department to step away from
that world that he'd been part of for
decades and to make this decision to
speak out publicly and take a stand on
the UAP issue. It's probably the bravest
thing that he as a warrior, as a combat
soldier, has ever done. And I I was
really shocked today. Marrick, I'm going
to take a swipe at the stupid sod who
basically made this insinuation against
Lou. Um, I won't say who it was, but
this idiot commented online basically
saying in the wake of his CBS uh
morning's interview, you know, this is
just a cash card for Lu Alzando and that
essentially all this is about is
insinuating that he and we are all about
making money. I can tell you for Lou,
the costs have been intense. And that's
the thing that really struck me when I
was filming with him is the damage that
this has caused to his career, the
stress on his family life. It's intense.
And I don't think the public understands
the degree of sacrifice that he's making
in order to bring this issue into the
public domain.
>> I I couldn't agree more, Ross. and and
it really speaks to motivations. Um to
your point, I think actually physically
showing a photo of of the RV, the
trailer that that he lived in in your
special. Um it drives home that that
this was not easy for Lou, his family.
Um and it certainly, you know, uh was
was an enormous stressor on his life. Um
there's no question about that. I think,
you know, he saw, as as Chris Melon has
has elucidated, he saw a major national
security vulnerability, a gap, an
extraordinary gap that nobody was paying
attention to. Um, and, you know, he he's
been hammered. He's been um attacked
relentlessly
um online and by the Pentagon. And so,
you're you're absolutely right. He he
made some enormous sacrifices
um to come forward and he is driving the
conversation forward now you know
several years on from from going public
and from that um fairly well-known
resignation letter now um he is driving
the conversation and um you know he's
he's truly I think I would not be it
would not be hyperbolic to say that he
is one of the key catalysts behind some
of the most extraordinary legislation we
have seen in American history. I mean,
seeing the Senate Majority Leader Chuck
Schumer um put in writing in black and
white nonhuman intelligence go proceed
to list it two dozen times alongside
legacy programs, which as many of your
viewers know, but that's the the
nomenclature for these alleged programs
that um retrieved and reverse engineered
or attempted to reverse engineer um
non-human craft. And that that's not me
saying that, Ross. That's the Senate
majority leaders um black and white
legislation, right? And and you know,
there's been some chatter about, you
know, hey, this is just driven by
staffers. Well, um, gosh, I' I'd love to
show those people the the the clip of
Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor
engaging in a colloquy, a scripted
exchange with Senator Mike Rounds, a
Republican, going back to the the
bipartisan element of this, um, and
making extraordinary statements and and
saying direct quote, multiple credible
sources have told Congress that
information has been withheld illegally.
So, with just to quickly come full
circle, Lou has um catalyzed a
remarkable moment in American history.
And if it's all nonsense, um boy, we we
need to know. And that's all the more
reason to get this legislation passed
and for American citizens to engage
their elected representatives.
Marrick, I want to drill down into
something that I know is in your area of
expertise, which is the inevitable
criticism of Lou is going to be where's
the evidence? Uh, I mean, even in the
wake of the show that went to over the
weekend, you know, Lou's basically being
criticized for making assertions that he
can't back up and even on his own
admission he can't back up because he's
constrained by the Doppser, the Defense
Office pre-publication security review,
which very very heavily constrains what
he's allowed to talk about. But you were
talking there about Chuck Schumer, who,
if I'm not mistaken, Chuck's a member of
the gang of eight. He's a member of the
group of eight people in the Congress.
And this is why it's so significant.
This is why, you know, you could you
could drive a car at people and they
still wouldn't understand the
significance of this. Chuck Schumer is
one of the guys in the Congress who is
briefed, isn't he, into the most
sensitive secrets in the United States
defense and intelligence community. He's
allowed to know about the waved
unagnowledged special access programs,
the most dark secrets of all. And
presumably, if there is a legacy UFO
crash retrieval reverse engineering
program, one would assume that he's at
least privy to some of that. Or do you
believe that the implications of what
Lou is saying are that somebody like
Chuck Schumer has realized and the
reason why he's so motivated about this
with getting this legislation through
the Congress is because he's realized
there is something going on and he
doesn't know about it.
So, Ross, you a lot to unpack there. Um,
you you started your show off uh, you
know, speaking about um, and I'm I'm
going to go to your to your promotional
element um, about the the diet that
Americans have and how um, processed
foods are are a major factor in in
American health. I think another major
problem in America today is that we do
not we no longer teach civics. And I
think a lot of the people who comment on
um on the the Schumer legislation, for
example, have no clue about how our
government fundamentally works. So yes,
you are correct. Chuck Schumer is a
member of the gang of eight um a very
elite group of members of Congress um
who are supposed to be under the our
constitution um aware of read into our
most sensitive secrets. And when
somebody like Chuck Schumer, a cautious
politician, comes out and authors 64
pages that if you look at read the
letter and spirit of that legislation,
it says
me, I somebody who should have knowledge
of X, Y, and Z does not have that
knowledge. And we have quote credible
evidence and testimony that indicates
that information has been withheld from
Congress illegally. That is a an ex it's
an earthshattering development that I I
must say I'm ashamed at the uh US media
the the mainstream media um the lack of
the attention the the complete ignorance
of the kind of the monumental
allegations that are part of this
legislation as well as the the caliber
of the individuals who are sponsoring
it. Let alone we can take Lou out of
this. You can take individuals like Carl
Nell, a high-ranking former army officer
who's said the same things. David Grush,
you can take all of them out of this. If
you just take the Schumer legislation
just by itself on its own, it is a
remarkable um piece of of legislative uh
writing that that has in
numbers of subtext and context that need
to be analyzed. So, do you think Schumer
knows about the crash retrieval program
or do you suspect he's realized that
he's not been read into something that
properly Congress ought to have been
briefed about
>> here? That's a good question. And and
Ross, I I like to deal in fact, so now
we're going into speculation territory
and I want to I want to be clear that
I'm speculating here. And I suspect that
he um I don't think he's been read in if
these if these programs are actually um
in existence. And correct me if I'm
wrong if you've heard anything else, but
I suspect that thanks to Lou and and his
efforts and and other efforts, Chris
Melon, uh Dave Brush, you can go down
the list. I suspect that enough
individuals
have um come behind closed doors to
Congress and have resulted that has
resulted in this legislation. A pet
theory of mine, and I I'm open to any
and and all alternative takes is that
Schumer specifically
was informed of these programs because I
see a split, a schism between what
Schumer and Rounds are doing on one side
and what Gillibrand, Rubio, and and the
other senators are doing on the on the
other side because you had these um last
year you had two kind of competing
efforts on UAP disclosure. They were
both complimentary. They both kind of
alleged the same thing, but but they
they seem to occur in parallel and they
seem to have been stovepiped and
separated from each other. And I find
that intriguing, right? Every indicator
that we have is that Schumer's and
rounds have been kind of doing something
in a perhaps a silo. Um, and and that
could be could be because Schumer was
informed perhaps by some highranking
officials privately that this is worth
pursuing. I could very well be wrong.
Um, but that's a possibility. I'm just
I'm just calling it how I see it. So,
that's that's um I think a distinct
possibility. Let's get into some of the
detail of what Lou revealed on the
NewsNation interview. I think one of my
favorite moments, if you can have a
favorite moment in something like this,
something as serious as this, is the
quite extraordinary detail that he gives
of an alleged biological implant, some
kind of alien implant being removed from
a US serviceman, I think at the Walter
Reed Medical Hospital, the military
hospital, um, where the surgeon who is
removing the object is so freaked out
because it appears to be trying to avoid
being captured by the surgeon and and
when it's in the petri dish, it even
moves in the petri dish. That that for
me was one of the most uncanny moments.
You know, you're literally describing
what may be nonhuman technology
implants. That's right, Ross. And and
look, I here's where I have to be um
maybe a little more circumspect and and
maybe even skeptical. And that that is a
remarkable
um story and and if we get more
corroborating information, excellent.
The bottom line from my perspective and
I think I started with this is these are
very serious people that are making
these statements and allegations to your
point. Right. That is all the more
reason why this legislation is so
important. We need to get to the bottom
of that, right? I Lou have nothing but
utmost respect for him, but we need
evidence. We need somebody to come
forward, raise their hand in front of
Congress and said, "Yes, I took that
specimen out of service member X. Go in
front of Congress, do it under oath.
Let's let's move this process forward."
So, I think that the uh the point is
thanks to your reporting and and your
interview, we now have something
tangible to dig into, to sink our teeth
into, and for Congress to pursue because
nobody else is going to pursue this.
>> I guess the question though in my mind,
Marik, is how much really is Lou's
interview going to move the needle?
because he is susceptible. Let's be
brutally honest about it. He is
susceptible to the allegation because of
the constraints imposed by his doppser
by that defense office pre-publication
security review. He's susceptible to the
allegation that he's just not providing
any evidence to back up what he says
that we just have to take his word. You
know, essentially I was told something
by people at Walter Reed Military
Hospital that an implant was removed
from a serviceman and that it was doing
weird things which appeared to be
evading detection. I mean, ultimately,
you're right. The only way to
substantiate that and to corroborate it
is to bring those people before the
Congress or to get them deposed in some
way, put maybe sit them in front of a TV
interview. If you're out there, whoever
that was, very happy to talk to you. But
the um the the thing that really does
make me wonder is whether the Alzando
interview in itself is going to move the
needle at all or whether even within the
UAP community there's going to be a kind
of a hoham. You know, well, you know,
we've heard all this before. These kind
of claims have been made before. Lou's
talked about Roswell before. He's
basically said Roswell was real. What's
the evidence? What do you say to that?
What do you say to that suggestion?
Where's the evidence,
>> Ross? Um, I agree completely and um,
I've been in touch with Lou and other
folks. Um, and you know, I suspect we we
may be learning more if if um, if
certain legal elements are addressed, we
we may be learning more and I'll have
more to say about that um, in a Hill
piece coming up soon. But I want to
really get back to um the core of your
question, Ross, and and I I'll I'll take
this back to the New York Times story
that Lou helped break with um Leslie
Kaine and and Ralph Blumenthal. And
that article u was published alongside
two videos, right? The go fast and the
gimbal video.
And all along there was an aviator by
the name of Ryan Graves who was
intimately familiar with that incident.
He didn't say anything publicly until
what? Until that video became public.
So, I'm hoping my hope is, and this is
part of why I cover this story, and my
hope is that um when people see your
special or read my piece or what have
you, that it it elicits some kind of
some kind of interest or it it's it
lights a fire and an an individual or
multiple individuals with knowledge of
that uh incident or allegation feel less
encumbered or or or free, feel more um
inspired ired to speak to Congress or
whoever the case may be. If it's the
media or if it's you, I hope they go to
you, uh, Ross. Um,
>> me too.
>> Yeah. So, I look look I think shining a
light on these allegations and and
reducing the stigma and normalizing this
conversation hopefully will will result
in a a critical mass that sustains
itself with more individuals coming
forward. I think that's the core of what
we are doing here. I I think that's the
key point and and that's what I was
looking forward to hear from you, which
is that what Lou Alzando has done is
normalize this conversation. I was
watching before I came in for this
interview, I was re-watching the CBS
Mornings interview that he did, which
was only 4 minutes, but four minutes on
a very key prime time uh network
television morning show. And it really
struck me how receptive that group of
interviewers were. I think there were
three interviewers from CBS sitting
there with him. They were very receptive
to what Lou was saying. There was no
attempt to giggle or stigmatize or treat
with taboo a subject that probably I
reckon five six years ago before the
whole New York Times story broke. I
reckon it would have been giggled at.
People did they kind of sniggered at the
subject of UAPs. Now we've moved beyond
that. I think the public there's a
wisdom of the crowd there. people are
basically thinking yeah you know what
there is something to this so I think
this the significance to me of the
imminent book the Lzando book is that
what it's doing is it's normalizing the
public conversation and hopefully as you
say making it possible for people who do
have that direct knowledge that at the
moment Lou Alzando can't reveal what he
knows uh to come forward. I just also
want to make the point it's funny it's
in the course of our um research when we
were checking lose bonafidees that you
normally do for this kind of interview.
I was doing a ringaround talking to
people in the Congress and talking to
people who have knowledge in the
Pentagon of Lou Alzando's background.
And I don't think people quite realize
the job that he was doing, especially
the most recent job that he was doing at
UDI, the office of the under secretary
for defense intelligence. Lou was
essentially a liaison with the highest
level oversight bodies for special
access programs inside the defense
department. I think it's over the the
senior review group or some such body.
Basically the body that that gets to
review all of the special access
programs inside the Pentagon. It was Lou
who was basically at that very high
level clearly highly cleared to know an
enormous amount about some of America's
most sensitive secrets. That's the thing
that leapt out to me in his book as well
is that I didn't know a huge amount to
be honest with you about Lou's past
work. And when I was talking to people
trying to figure out who Lu Alzando was
and trying to get to the bottom of what
his role really was with ATIP, the
Pentagon's UFO investigation program, a
lot of people sort of slightly indicated
to me that one of the reasons they held
such huge respect for Lou Alzando, was
because he was such a highly cleared
guy. He was one of the guys who really
did know all the secrets in the Pentagon
at a very very high level basically
because he was working out of this
office in the under secretary for
defense intelligence with with your
knowledge of national security. How
significant is Lou's background to an
understanding of why we should take
seriously what he's saying?
Uh that that is a fantastic question and
I think for the the folks that are not
initiated into the kind of the nuances
and the arcane process of um of the
national security establishment
um Lou had a lot of tickets what are are
referred to those are the the special
accesses to um compartmented secret
programs and so um that is a huge part
of this. Lou Lou has the the the
background. He has the um the position
um to speak from some level of
authority. Of course we we need
evidence. Of course we need to um verify
claim X or Y. No question about that.
But the point is we need to take people
like Lou Carl Nell Dave Grush seriously.
Um there's there's this constant
refrain. Oh, we've always heard this
story. that's been it's been around for
years and years and years. Well, maybe
there a maybe there is a reason that has
been around for years, but B, we have
never had multiple individuals that were
so highly cleared into very sensitive
programs and activities basically in
lock step with the core allegation and
that is extraordinary and that's all the
more reason why we need to take this as
seriously as as you and I do. Um, but I
I really, you know, think we need to
spur some more interest um in the media
and the broader public um because this
is the the the characters at um the key
characters are are truly credible on
their face. Let's put it that way.
>> It's a huge sacrifice for Alzando. I
mean, I was really struck when I was
talking to him and Jen, his wife, the
financial, but also the emotional cost
for him and his family, just dealing
with moving away from a very secure job
as a fairly senior official in the
Department of Defense, coming out of the
shadows, basically losing everything,
going and working for Tom Delong's to
the stars academy, getting his salary
cut in half, living in a motor home,
digging his own pit toilet, I mean, my
god, it was a wretched time for the poor
bloke. I I have to admit, seeing the
pressure that he's under and and how uh
vilified he is often by people who are
completely ignorant of the sacrifices
that he's making. I do wonder sometimes
whether he he might regret privately
making the decision that he made because
the public to a large degree is
unappreciative of the sacrifice that
he's making. And I think one of the
things that we we should acknowledge,
Merrick, as part of our job as
journalists is these people,
whistleblowers like Lou, they make
enormous sacrifices. Dave Grush, Lou,
even Carell, Chris Melon, all of these
people sticking their heads up. There's
a tendency for these people to get shot
at uh purely and simply because they're
taking the risk of actually sticking
their head up above the parapit and
talking about things that are very very
unpopular from within the defense
department that frankly, let's be honest
about it, a group of gatekeepers don't
want known.
>> Absolutely right, Ross. Um and that's so
I I I try not to consider myself a
journalist. I don't have any formal
journalistic training. I do have a
little bit of analytic training, right?
I did worked in the government um
graduate school degree really focused on
analysis national security analysis and
when I when I look at the various
players Lou spec particularly Lou in
this case Grush Nell to your point it
that does fit into my analytic judgment
what what is the what are these
individuals personal circumstances are
they enriching themselves I I don't see
um obviously Lou is living in an RV and
digging his own toilet. He's not
enriching himself on this topic, right?
So So that is that is certainly
something to um consider in in our
analytic kind of process and judgment as
we as we vet different claims, as we
look at motivations. Very important,
right? Um so I think you hit the nail on
the head. It's it's very very important
to to keep these personal circumstances
in mind. And I think it's absurd to call
um these individuals grifters. Just
absurd on on their face. They gave up um
very well-paying jobs to to speak what
they believe is the truth. And and um
you know, there certainly is a lot of
circumstantial evidence, whether it's um
the legislation alone, right? There's an
enormous amount of circum circumstantial
evidence that that they're on to
something significant.
I think one of the things that leapt out
at me in the interview that I did with
Lou and he's also expanded on this in
detail in the book is his account of the
Collins elite that there is in the
Pentagon and in the intelligence
community a group of people who are
deeply and no criticism of them for this
by the way they're entitled to be
religious they're deeply evangelical
Christian deeply deeply religious and
they perceive the phenomenon whatever it
is as demonic. And uh Lou tells me in
the interview and he does a little bit
of this in the book as well about a
meeting or a sort of a confrontation in
a hallway that he had with a very senior
member of the um Collins elite, somebody
who was very very senior in DIA. I think
you and I both know who he's talking
about. And um I've looked online and
this person is he's a very deep
evangelical Christian, somebody of a
vowed Christian faith. What do you think
about the propriety of somebody in the
defense department though letting their
religious faith intrude on one the
public's right to know about something
that is according to Lou Alzando, Chris
Melon, Dave Brush, Colonel Nell, a
national security, public safety threat?
And what do you think about the um the
idea that you know religious beliefs are
allowed to intrude into the day-to-day
workings of a government agency,
especially one as crucial as the
Pentagon.
>> I think it's outrageous, Ross. Pure and
simple. It's outrageous. I think it's
it's unconscionable
um to have any kind of bias, right?
That's the worst thing from an analytic
from a national security perspective.
any kind of bias that clouds objective
thinking, objective analysis, um is a is
a major major source of concern. Um and
you know, if what Lou is saying is
accurate, this is this is pretty
extraordinary. Um and you know, I do
want to on the topic of religion and
theology in UAP, I want to quickly just
plug and I'm not an expert. I'm the
first person to admit when I'm not an
expert on something. I want to quickly
plug um a book by Paul Thigpin uh
Catholic theologian um on uh
extraterrestrial intelligence in the
Catholic Church I believe is the title
and then um Matt Halstead is another
individual um who an academic a you know
a faithbased academic who is who's done
some both of them have done some pretty
remarkable
um very deep kind of academic work on on
this topic and I think I I hope it's
fair for me to to summarize their their
conclusions, their findings are are um
that there there really is there from
their perspective and I it's logical to
me um that there is no inherent conflict
between um what Lou is alleging or or
the possibility of of nonhuman
intelligence and and these religions,
these these religious traditions that we
have. Um, that may seem counterintuitive
on its face, but I I think they've done
a remarkable job of of addressing that.
So, I I want to quickly I'll just
summarize. I think it's outrageous. It's
unacceptable. It's unconscionable for
any kind of religious belief. I don't
care what religion it is or or any
belief doesn't even have to be
theological um to interfere and be an
analytic bias. But also there is some
some pretty robust academic um
literature and work by these by these
theologians that um says otherwise that
that is very clear. So I hope anybody
that has that perception of this
inherent bias or um this this inherent
clash takes some time to actually look
at at what these gentlemen have have
written and put out.
One thing I wanted to ask you about
Marrick was there were people online I
noticed who were questioning whether Lou
is really taking that much of a risk and
they're running this line that because
he's gone through the Doppsa process
because he's sought approval from the
defense office pre-publication secure
review office security review office
he's not really taking a risk at all and
frankly for him this is pretty lame that
essentially all he's doing is paring
what he's being told by the Pentagon.
And there's a lot of people and oh god I
think the UFO community their own worst
enemies on this issue frankly where they
they basically shaft somebody like Lou
coming forward and and insinuate that
he's essentially operating with some
kind of agenda. Let's deal with that.
Let's go to the issue. Do you think Lou
is some kind of plant that he's some
kind of mole who's pushing some kind of
dark double agenda that's pushing some
dark nefarious agenda inside the defense
department that we're not allowed to
know about? Or do you think he's just
genuinely the whistleblower that
certainly I believe he is?
>> Unless you and I are absurd judges of
character, and that's possible, Ross.
Um, no, I I do not think I do not think
that that is the case. I think um I
think he is he is coming forward and and
making sacrifices because he truly
profoundly believes in what he is
putting out in the public record. Um and
and again I'm I'm just going to go back
to this is all the more reason for this
legislation to pass to get to the bottom
of this. If there's nothing to see here
and lose wrong, okay, fine. But we we
absolutely must look because as we've
said, Lou has put his reputation, his
livelihood, his retirement uh on the
line for to to speak out publicly on on
a a very very stigmatized topic. One of
the um things that I found especially
intriguing and I I know from talking to
other people who've been involved in
close-up contact with the phenomenon is
the way Lou admits that the phenomenons
followed him home. The hitchhiker
effect. And it was fascinating talking
to him and Jen. There's a lot of other
stuff that um we didn't include in the
program that they've described that I
won't go into here. But at the very
least, what they describe in the book is
these orbs, these balls of light that
appear to be manifesting themselves in
the family home in front of Lou, his
wife, their two beautiful daughters. I
mean, if I was a Pedagon employee and I
knew that whatever it is that I'm
investigating was following me home,
literally something anomalous is
actually manifesting itself in my home.
That's I think one of the most
extraordinary things that underlines to
me the degree of sacrifice that somebody
like him is making. Um, what what's your
take on the whole hitchhiker effect? Do
you find it plausible?
>> Yeah, that that is a great question,
Ross. And and again, I I'm going to have
to I think I'm I'm going to beat a dead
horse here, but I I think these are
extraordinary statements coming from
very credible people. I can't trust them
on on their face because I' I've seen no
evidence of that, right? But when you
have multiple individuals
largely saying the same thing, right,
that there is something that is
following them home, hitchhiking home
with them. um that begs for more
investigation. I'm not going to take it
at face value, but I'm not going to dis
I'm certainly not going to discard it at
the on the other end of the spectrum.
Right. So, so this is absolutely it's
vital that we get to the bottom of it. I
think I want to just from a from an
analytic perspective um and Ross I'll
I'll maybe get get into a little bit of
why I am so fascinated by this topic and
and the the analytic basis for why I'm
even having this conversation with you
and that is because I've actually taken
the time to read
well over 150 raw case files from
project sign project blue book and
Project Grudge, the the um the 1940s and
the 1950s, those are the the u programs
that the government had to investigate
UAP and for to for any objective analyst
to read through those reports and and
see the remarkable similarities from
individuals hundreds if not thousands of
miles apart who had no, you know, had no
possible way of knowing each other's
reports and and and seeing the
consistenc Y in those reports is
remarkable. And I will add that one of
the most common phenomena that is was
reported and I assume still is and if we
read between the lines of a lot of what
the Pentagon is has is released in in
terms of pilot reports that round
spherical objects sometimes multicolored
usually red at night or or or metallic
during the day and you know this Ross
right we've we've covered this that is
one of the most commonly reported
phenomena Um, so that aligns with the
historical record. Let me just back up.
What Lou is reporting aligns with the
historical record. Um, it aligns with
what we've heard from James Latsky who
who wrote a book about this. I think it
was Skinwalkers at the Pentagon. Um, so
from an analytic perspective, it's
fascinating, but I need more evidence.
And this is this is just crying out.
It's begging for more investigation.
>> Absolutely. Can you explain to our
audience why would the defense
department allow Lou to do any
interview? I mean essentially if it's
true that there is this legacy retrieval
program, crash reverse engineering
program,
why allow him to do any kind of
interview at all? Why why not just say,
"Look, you're a defense department
employee. We're going to shut you up." I
mean, in my in my jurisdiction in
Australia, the defense department hates
the media. They loathe talking to the
media. And you know, I'm always amazed
that the Pentagon actually has a
publication security review office that
actually allows its employees to get
their potential media commentary or
published commentary published. In
Australia, they don't I think they'd
rather put you up against a wall and
shoot you. So why why is there a DOPS
process? Why why is there even a process
like this at all? And should we make a
conclusion from the Doppsa process that
there is a willingness inside the
Pentagon or at least some part of the
the Pentagon to be open and candid about
this issue? Why give Blue the
opportunity to speak at all?
>> Yeah. And and I this is this is an area
where I'm not an expert in, but I
suspect it is a constitutionally
protected first amendment right for a
former employee to speak about X.
However, if Y is classified, they can
only restrain or constrain an um an
ability the the former employees ability
to speak about the classified portion,
the the portion that was covered by an
NDA, for example. So, so there's that
inherent free speech right to write a
book, to go make a movie script up to a
point, and that point that line is is
classified information. I suspect I I'm
sure somebody on the internet will
correct me if I'm wrong, but um I
believe that that is at at core what
what the dynamic that is at play here.
>> So really I want to get your final sort
of encapsulation of where the Alzando
book and interview takes us Marik I mean
has it pushed the needle at all? Is it
really advancing public awareness or
public initiative at all? And more
importantly, is it going to make a jot
of difference in the Pentagon or in the
Congress?
>> Ross, I'm I am optimistic
um that Lou's book will in fact move the
needle. Um that being said, that is a
testable hypothesis, right? we could
have this conversation in a year in two
years and we can check to see how much
if at all lose book and your your
interview moved the needle. Um that
being said I I am from my perspective I
am only seeing more individuals more
credible people coming forward and and
seeing um a slow let's call it an
increase let's you know it's it's a
chain reaction right of individuals at
at one point it was just Chris Melon and
Luke then Dave Gosh came out then Carl
Nell came out then James Latsky came out
right so you see this everex expanding
and and this is the word that Senate
majority leader Chuck Schumer used in
his press release a vast web of
individuals. That's the direct quote.
They Congress uncovered a quote vast web
of individuals and that formed the basis
for this remarkable legislation. So, um
I'm optimistic that the book, your
interview, our coverage, our our
combined coverage will get the right
people who are interested in this to
come forward and hopefully catalyze some
more transparency, some more openness or
more action, more congressional action
with teeth um in the coming months and
and years. If the legislation doesn't
pass at the end of this year, if the
gatekeepers, if the uh the sick offense
to the defense aerospace industry are
allowed to get their way on the hill
towards the end of this year as the
defense authorization act comes through
the house, if it doesn't pass, isn't
there a risk that we could go back to
another 30 or 40 years of continued
embargo on truth about the UAP issue? I
mean, this could all go back into a box.
So very easily, couldn't it?
>> Ross, it's something I've I've thought
about it and it's um the me physically
seeing history repeat itself. I'm seeing
echoes of the post Robertson panel
defense department in the the current
UFO analysis office, right? It's there's
nothing to see here. It's all nonsense.
Um so yes, could we go back to that
dynamic? Absolutely we could. Um,
however, and maybe I'm just being
optimistic, but I just just seeing more
and more credible individuals
coming forward publicly despite the
stigma, despite the the risk to their
reputation and their livelihoods. I am
cautiously optimistic um that the genie
is out of the uh out of the bottle. But
Ross, maybe we can make a deal right
here, right now that we have this
conversation in a year or two and see if
I was right or if I was wrong.
>> Now, Merrick, I want to pay credit to
the work that you did in picking Dr.
Sean Kirk Patrick up on some of the
things that he said in some of his
public commentary. He gave us a very
late response uh to our story. And he
said, he told NewsNation, quote, "At no
time did I provide false information to
Congress. In fact, my team provided
actual evidence, something that all of
the other claimants have failed to do."
What's your response to that Dr. Sha
Kirkpatrick comment? I am not privy to
exactly what he and Arrow provided to
Congress. However,
I have heard from sources
on the Senate side that that is
inaccurate and that he did not share
what was presented to him by
whistleblowers with Congress. Um, so
there is a major disconnect there. Um,
frankly, I don't trust Kirk Patrick.
I'll be very honest with you. I gave him
the benefit of the doubt. I spoke to him
in person in November of 2023. I spoke
to him in a lengthy interview. I want to
be very clear. I was I'm very grateful
for his time. But um based on what he
told me about the most recognizable UFO
UAP footage of all time, you'd think
that the guy whose job was UFO analysis
could maybe know some basic facts about
the most extraordinary UFO or most
recognizable UFO footage of all time.
and he either lied to me to my face
twice or he's astoundingly misinformed
and illinformed about um the key UFO
incidents that we all know about the
Nimttz incident and the 2015 uh the
gimbal incident and the go fast videos
and all that. So um I have very little
>> Can I can I just stop you there for a
moment because I'm really interested in
getting getting you the detail on this.
what were the um
>> the possible untruths or inaccuracies in
what he told you?
>> Yeah, sure. It's it's um pretty
astounding. So, the gimbal video, I
think most Americans have seen it. They
might not know it, but they've seen it.
Um, and he told me that that was likely
um a balloon
uh with a the the that bizarre infrared
reflection or or infrared signature is
he told me is is a reflection from the
sun. Okay, Dr. Kirkpatre,
that incident occurred at night, so we
can rule out the sun, right? You can
hear the aviators on the um cockpit
audio say that the object and in the
video and the other objects that are
accompanying it are going against
120 knot winds. That's category 4
hurricane force winds. I don't know,
Ross. I don't know any balloons that go
against category 4 hurricane force
winds. And if you do, um boy, that's
that's a that's a heck of a a child's,
you know, birthday balloon or toy. So,
um, that's one. Uh, pretty astounding.
If you don't know the basic facts about
the most recognizable UFO video of all
time, I don't know what to tell you. Uh,
what where did our taxpayer dollars go?
That's astounding. Um, so that that's
the issue. The issue is that we we don't
appear to be getting from the Pentagon's
UFO investigation office, the all domain
anomaly resolution office. We don't
appear to be getting a scrupulously
objective, reasoned, wellargued
explanation for why we shouldn't be
taking these seriously as anomalous
objects.
And I I'll quickly the Go Fast video, he
endorsed NASA's analysis after I NASA
made a just an astounding catastrophic
ma mathematical error in its analysis. I
have some help. I've got actual an
actual scientist helping me on the you
know work we're working through this
stuff and after I pointed out NASA's
error on that particular video um Kirk
Patrick said oh I haven't looked at
NASA's analysis are you are you joking
me I mean you you literally just
endorsed it gave it a ringing
endorsement a few months ago and then
you said you haven't looked at it I mean
this is just this is just astounding
incompetence or it's a disinformation
operation it's it's one or the other's
no there's no there's no gray area here
this is this is binary. It's zero or
one. And and look, I you know, he could
have misspoken. Uh fine, I'll give him
the benefit of the doubt the first time.
He did it twice. And now let's let's be
analytic about this. Um Aeros historical
report was from an analytic perspective
atrocious. It was it was astoundingly it
was awful. It was one of the worst
pieces of of
>> It was a dog's breakfast. Call it what
it is. The dog ate my homework.
I wouldn't even call it a report. And
then and then you had this absurd
explanation for some of your viewers
might remember um during the the the big
UFO hearing. Matt Gates, congressman
from Florida, um described a UAP
incident that occurred that Air Force
personnel felt obligated to report to
his office. There's a reason they went
to his office and not up the chain of
command, I suspect.
um a pretty remarkable incident and
Arrow put out this they called it a case
resolution report that said it was some
some kind of high-end lighting balloon
that that even MC West didn't buy this
that MC West is some of your viewers
know is is perhaps the most notable um
UAP skeptic in the world. he didn't buy
this explanation of their their first,
you know, their their primary culprit
for this incident and and any number of
you get into the radar issues. We don't
need to belabor get into the nuances,
but the point is Kirkpatrick's comments
to me come in a in a much broader
patchwork, quilt work of nonsense and
absurdity that is coming out of Arrow,
which looks exactly like what we saw
with Blue Book following the the
Robertson panel in 1953.
Well, Marik von Reninkamp, let's just
hope that in 30 years time you and I
aren't still tilting at windmills
looking for Pentagon truth and honesty
on the subject of UAPs. I sincerely hope
we get an answer, any kind of answer
sometime soon. Merrick von Renamp, thank
you so much for joining reality check
and helping me analyze the Lou Alzando
interview and imminent book. look
forward to talking to you again soon.
>> Ross, thanks so much for having me.
>> Hello and welcome to Reality Check.
Before we get started this week, I
wanted to tell you a little bit about
our sponsor for this week's show.
Imagine having the same personal trainer
as the boss. Personal trainer to the
star Tony Horton says he's found a much
more effective way to help you fight age
related muscle loss and even build new
muscle. He's trained celebrities like
Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and Stevie
Nicks to name just a few. And he's now
using his body strengthening method to
help thousands of Americans remain
healthy and active as they hit middle
age and beyond. He's the subject of a
short new video report detailing how his
method works. It's free and online right
now for you to watch or share. Simply

Now, let's get on with the show.
[Music]
Hello and welcome back to Reality Check.
Well, this week we've got a very special
guest. We've got Tony Harris, the host
of The Proof is Out There, a show that
investigates the world's most mysterious
videos, photos, and audio recordings,
and uses the best technology and experts
to render a credible verdict. Tony is an
Emmy award-winning journalist and
filmmaker and since 2021, so that's
probably coming up to four years, he's
been the host of The Proof is Out There,
which has become a hugely popular show
on the History Channel. He's previously
been an anchor with CNN and Al Jazer.
He's also a podcaster. His show Monster
DC Sniper is a true crime podcast doing
very well, reaching number three in all
of podcasting in 2020. Welcome, Tony.
Good to have you here, sir.
>> That's a that's a wonderful
introduction. I It's so great to be with
you. Thank you for your patience. I know
we've tried to make this happen for for
a bit now and we're here and and I
couldn't be happier. Thank you.
So Tony, I wouldn't be doing my job
properly unless I asked you the question
that I think is the is the issue that is
the enigma for many people with
journalists.
>> Where do you stand on the anomalous
phenomena that you report about? What's
>> Yeah, I have never believed we're in,
you know, this galaxy or this universe
alone. And you know, you know better
than I how many galaxies are there out
there? How many universes are there out
there? I I've never felt we're alone. We
may be the most significant of the
planets in any universe. We just don't
know that at this point. Imagine what
what math and science had to come
together. What creationist vision had to
come together in order for our
atmosphere to have been created to
support life in the way that it does on
the third rock from the sun, right?
That's a fascinating thing to think
about. And yet, I just know that there
is so much more for us to to understand
and so much more for us to learn. So,
you know, I I'm I'm pleased to to be on
a on a vehicle to explore an avenue of
journalism that this great craft has
taken me into this area. I never
expected to be here. I never expected to
be reporting on anomalous phenomena, but
here I am and it's been a a great ride
and I'm just so happy that so many
people around the world now have joined
us for it.
Now Tony, you and I are hardbitten news
journalists. We've been in we've been in
newsrooms in major media organizations.
Am I am I being fair when I say there is
a stigma, a taboo attached to anomalous
phenomena like UFOs,
creepy things like the paranormal,
ghosts, Bigfoot. I mean, there is a
taboo, isn't there?
>> Absolutely. And I don't know about you,
but I bought into it. Um, I really did
for a long time and it's it occurs to me
now it's just because I didn't have
enough understanding. I didn't have
enough knowledge. Um, there was so much
more that was beyond me at the time. And
it's uh I will tell you what was
interesting for me kind of this
transformation.
Uh, I can remember being a kid working
one of my earliest jobs and I was I was
a bus boy at a restaurant uh in
Baltimore, Maryland, my hometown. And I
can remember being pulled into the Star
Trek world. I I think I owe Shatner a
debt. So, it's kind of crazy and weird
and odd and gives me the goose flesh
sometimes to think about the fact that
I'm on a channel with William Shatner
and often times I think even in this new
season that uh that is rolling out um
his show leads into ours. So to think
that uh years and years and years ago
I'm watching Shatner and and it his his
show Star Trek is what really sort of
opened my eyes to this entire world and
then finding my way into journalism and
hearing all of the skepticism and
reading it how pervasive it was around
this this idea this notion of anomalous
phenomena and UFOs UAPs and you know
that's the province of of weird Uncle
John who's in the garage and we slide
him his meals under the door and he's
Mr. Tinfoil Hat guy. So to to find
myself in a position now where I'm I'm
taking a look at this as as you are a
skeptical journalist and you know
searching for more evidence and evidence
gets us to proof uh proof gets us to
truth. Um it's it's a a fascinating sort
of evolution in my own personal journey
in this space.
You've talked about how inevitably
because of the Fermy paradox, there must
be civilizations out there. There must
be intelligent life out there in the
universe. But the thing that strikes me
about the proof is out there is that
it's a show that quite blatantly
suggests often that there is anomalous
phenomena right here on this planet.
That we're being visited by some type of
nonhuman intelligence that there are
perhaps paranormal entities like ghosts,
Bigfoot. Where do you stand? Like what
what's the level of proof that we look
for? I mean, I the thing I the thing I'm
increasingly thinking as a journalist is
how you're right. You know, we were I
I'm as guilty as you are. I was in a
newsroom. I I can remember coming to my
editor with a photograph of a UFO that a
lady had taken over her washing line.
And this is a major newspaper in
Australia.
>> And the editor said to me, he said,
"Rosco, we don't do stories about UFOs.
They're BS. You don't do stories about
UFOs." And I bought that. I accepted
that you don't do that. And yet this
woman had taken a perfectly clear
photograph on a film camera which we
developed out of the camera. So there
was no chance for her to have meddled
with the film. Why is there that stigma?
I mean a lot of people suggest to me
that we were got at that you know
there's some dark men in black force
that's going around shutting us down and
stopping us. But I don't think there's
that that's the case. I think there's
it's just a stigma, isn't it?
>> I I I don't believe that for a moment,
but I think you've hit on something with
that photograph from x number of years
ago, right? And the reaction of the
editor in the newsroom. I think you've
hit on what ends up being the conceit of
our show and the reason that we even
exist. Look, all credit to the folks at
the History Channel and and them being
willing to go, you know, where other
channels and other shows dared not go
years ago with the unexplained
uh with Ancient Aliens and and exploring
what had been talked about in Quiet
Corners, but had not been brought into
the open. Okay, so those are the shows
that predate what we're doing. And then
the next bold step by the History
Channel is that we're going to create a
show
that takes a critical look at at myths,
legends,
and things that go bump in the night.
And more than that, what we know our
audience
likes, is interested in, wants to know
more about. So, is there a way for us to
create a show that in essence super
serves that audience and takes a a more
critical look at the myths and legends
and what's true and asks those the
questions and and then tries to get to
the bottom of that. So, all credit to
History Channel for that. Um and and you
take this on and the other the only way
this show works
is that people have been willing to in
essence play along with us to say to us,
hey look, I captured something. Take a
look at this. I can't explain it. Maybe
it's maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's
something. Are you willing to take a
look at that? We also know and you know
this you know the staples of of of our
show and the work of anyone in the space
you included
the staples are Bigfoot Loch Ness
what military pilots are capturing right
what's in our seas what are what are the
strange things that are in our seas that
we don't yet know about because we
haven't gone 5,000 leagues beneath the
sea right So those end up being the
staples of our of our show. They hold us
up and and and I I am really plain about
this. They provided us with a bit of a
cushion.
We were able to do this wonderful thing
that History Channel does is they they
take the historical record. They update
it when they can, but they're always
able to take you back and revisit that
historical record. And when we get a new
clip, when we get a new story, we can
update that record. So yeah, those are
are essentially the conceits of the
show, the the the pillars as we
mentioned. And then the the willingness
of the audience to say, okay, I see what
you're doing. Your format is you're
going to take what we send you and if it
passes a particular threshold, you'll
put it on the air. Ah, but more than
that, you're going to apply some rigor.
You're going to bring experts to the
table to take a look at this. And then
you're going to do the the really either
crazy thing, insane thing, or the smart
thing. We'll see how many seasons we're
able to to, you know, keep the show uh
interesting and informative for people.
But we're going to pass a verdict.
We're going to tell you what
>> there's a great line that I I think
describes well the way a lot of
establishment science responds to
anomalous phenomena and it's it can't be
therefore it isn't.
>> Yeah.
>> And I I I I suspect the mainstream media
I want you to put your pointy head hat
on for a moment. Um, one of the things I
worry about is now that I've gone down
the rabbit hole of UAPs in particular
and anomalous phenomena.
>> I'm I'm increasingly finding scientists
who acknowledge privately that there is
a scientific basis, especially with
quantum phenomena, to explain
potentially some of what has long been
described as anomalous phenomena,
including perhaps spirits, ghosts,
Sasquatches. You know, there's talk of
interdimensional portals. There's
there's talk of um you know, even David
Grush, when I did the interview with
him, the intelligence whistleblower in
2023.
>> I missed that. Okay, I need to see that.
Oh, sorry.
>> Sure. D David basically acknowledged
that perhaps one explanation for the
phenomena is that it's interdimensional,
that it's not extraterrestrial at all.
>> Yeah.
I just want to ask you, do you think
there's a risk for mainstream media
knowing the volume of the audience
that's interested in this subject that
if they don't engage with this subject,
they're going to lose the faith of their
audience? I mean, I'm genuinely
concerned that great institutions like
the New York Times, the Washington Post,
a lot of mainstream television, they
don't want to engage with this subject.
And I think as a result, they're
alienating an audience that as a wisdom
of the crowd dictates, they they think
there's something to it.
>> I think you're going to be happy with
what's developing in the states. Um,
all of the mainstream media
certainly covered the congressional
hearings a few years ago.
I think the turning point for me because
you know when you get approached to do a
show like like this and you know you've
kind of made your bones in mainstream
journalism
you know you one of the things that at
least runs through your mind is is is
this something I can is this a real
subject area? Is there real journalism
going on here? I'm going to look like a
knucklehead for for delving into this
space you know to stay in true crime
stay in documentaries and and and make
your bones there. But the the one thing
that convinced me that there's something
here is when more and more mainstream
outlets started to cover this. I
remember seeing reporting about this in
this topic right in the New York Times
and and and I think whoa wait a minute
if it's in the New York Times uh the
great lady then okay maybe there's
something here and so I I think that
more and more mainstream outlets are
devoting time to it. I'm seeing it on
more and more television shows uh and
and news shows and news shows. I I think
that I'm seeing story lines that that
incorporate aspects of what we do,
right, of the of the area that we're in,
more and more story lines are popping up
in in scripted television. So, I I think
whatever Genie had been long locked up
and whatever stigma was being applied to
people who were delving into the space
for a long long time, I think that's
been largely removed. I think there are
there is enough skepticism out there to
keep us all honest. Uh I think we all
want the clear definitive picture of of
the yeti, right? Of the inarguable,
right? The Bigfoot, the skunk ape,
right? We all want that. And but what I
think has been is that the public
consciousness on all of this, all of
these areas has been raised to a place
where I think uh we're going to gather
more and more evidence of this. We'll
get to proof and then we'll get to
knowable truths in in these particular
areas of concern for us.
>> Now, this week you've got a brand new
series of the proof is out there. What
can you tell us about the new series? I
I love it. And and there are a couple of
reasons. I know everybody comes on and
they talk about the show and they say
they love the show. Um I'm going to tell
you why I love our show. And one of the
reasons that I love the the series
that's that's airing now is that it is a
more balanced.
>> You know, one of the things we we hope
to do when we do this kind of work is
get to a place where a show where we
don't have the first season looking over
our shoulders and self-consciousness
about the show. We are what we are. And
even in the beginning, you're not quite
sure what you are. Well, we're into
what, season four or whatever, wherever
we are. Uh, when you see the show this
season, I think you're going to see a a
far more settled show.
A show that really knows what it is
that has receive the buyin from the
audience so that we're, you know,
operating with an embarrassment of
riches in terms of the content we get to
pick and choose from.
Um, I think for example, our our
premiere episode is a is a great example
of the kind of balance that we can now
achieve with the show.
>> Can you tell us what it's about?
>> Well, absolutely. We we kick off this
episode with, you know, the the long
legend skunk ape that, you know, legend
says still to this day can be found in
the southeast the south and southeast
quadrants of the United States. whether
it's New Orleans and Louisiana, whether
it's in Florida, that the legendary
skunk ape is alive and well and thriving
and can be found.
It's a perfect opportunity for us to do
what we do best on this show. We get
some recent video, in many cases, new
video. Some some of the new video is
actually being directed to us now, and
we get to take a look at it. it it
passes the first threshold for us which
is that it's interesting video. Um not
many people have seen it or if they have
seen it you know the comments are rife
with debate and we get to dive into that
debate. The second threshold that it has
to to cross for us is is there a
historical thread to this story and as
you know there is always a historical
threat to anything that speaks to
Bigfoot and Yeti and Sasquatch and Skunk
ape. So the history on that is clear and
we get to update that history. The third
threshold that the bar that has to be
cleared is when we send it to the
experts are they interested? Does is the
video itself interesting? Does it
provide them an opportunity to tell a
story? And do they think they can get to
the bottom of it? And and them getting
back to us and saying, "I'm not sure we
can get to the bottom of it. That works
for us. That works for our show."
Um, and then the last hurdle, can we
come up with what we feel and everyone
agree on? What is a compelling verdict
on this clip? That's our show. And the
skunk ape story, the video in in our
first story in this this premiere
episode of the show gives us an
opportunity to show off, you know, and
flex our muscles as a show a little bit.
And that's why I love that. the the the
other story that I'm really kind of keen
on, you know, there's been a bit of an
evolution for me as I've been working on
this show, I just find myself
gravitating more and more to the
science, right? the people that we have
on the show, whether it's Mio Kaku, you
know,
um and and and and all of his all of his
smarts as a physicist. Uh and all the
experts that we have, whether it's our
audio analyst, our video analyst, and
our tech people, uh they've just they've
brought me along for the ride in a way
that I've just become more and more
interested in the science of this. So we
we we dive into this controversy where
people want seem to want to debunk the
idea that there were rovers that went to
Mars and you know and sent back these
amazing pictures that we were analyzing
and everyone wants to take and a narrow
view of this or that or the other and
and critique it and say ah there's a
femur. Ah there's a what is that? Is
that a limming right there? Is it right?
Is that a rodent? What is that? So uh
and they want to say aha. You know how
the people that we that we know and and
comment in the space are quick to point
out what they think is uh a failing of
our show or a failing of the research or
or
the hoax being perpetrated by the
government in this case. You didn't send
rovers to Mars. This is some sound stage
in Hollywood. Right. So I love that
because it gives the again, you know, a
moment for our experts to really flex uh
their knowledge. And so I love that
story because I'm I find myself just
getting a little nerdier as as we go
here in these various seasons and I I
find myself being drawn to the science
and and wanting to know as much as I can
when we when we get these moments about
the science behind them.
>> You you've talked about the the
structure of the show. It's got this
format where you have experts who
analyze and and sometimes they disagree.
>> Yes.
>> I'm wondering what are the shows you
like the most? Every now and then you'll
do a debunk show where you'll say say
for example you know four UFO hoaxes or
you know Bigfoot hoaxes and what rates
better? What do you think the audience
wants most of all? Do you think they
want to see their biases proved that
there is this anomalous phenomena or do
you think people actually enjoy seeing
rigorous investigation? Do you feel
pressure I guess at the heart of all of
this? Do you feel pressure to satisfy an
audience by showing something to be
anomalous or do you think people
actually want to see this stuff
rigorously investigated?
>> Yeah, I I think that's a wonderful
question because I think in initially
when we were talking about the show, you
know, I I will acknowledge there was a
bit of concern and and and I voiced it
and others voiced it that we would end
up being purely a debunking show, right?
I don't I don't know that that's a lot
of fun. right? Uh particularly when
you're asking for people to buy in and
you're asking for people, you know, to
offer up their views and thoughts on a
video that they've they've sent in. So,
I I don't know that's a lot of fun. Uh
but I'm happy to say I it it didn't it
wasn't very long before we realized that
we were uh we were getting not only
clips but that the historical record was
was full of stories where there were
real questions about
you know Patterson Gimlin film and there
were still questions for us to explore
about that film all these years later.
So, uh, that concern quickly went away.
But in terms of audience taste and and
what I think they might prefer, I I've
never been really concerned about that.
Uh, I know that we get enough clips in
the course of a year that we end up with
a fair amount of clips that our folks
can't explain.
Now, they may not be able to explain it
because the quality of the video doesn't
allow us to explain it or we may not be
able to explain it because uh we're not
sure what it is, what a light source is.
We've got, you know, we've got a a light
pillar story in in the premiere episode.
So, there there are times when we can't
differentiate between a sky lantern and
something else, right? There there are
moments, but we generally know the
category that this thing falls in. But
there are enough videos where we can't
be definitive about this that we end up
having a pretty good balance. I don't
know what the ratio is, but I gotta tell
you, I think uh one of our our our real
strengths and strong suits and
responsibilities to this genre, to this
space, to the people who take this very
seriously, I see it in the comments,
um is if we come across a fake, a hoax,
we have to call that out. And and I will
tell you as we've gone from season to
season the pressure on us to to get that
part of the show right has increased. I
don't have to tell you the technology is
getting to a place now where you can
make amazing deep deeper deep
>> tell me about it. That actually takes me
to my next question which is I I was I
was sent this week everybody would have
seen it. It's a picture of a beautiful
little child sitting in a boat in the
Carolina floods and it's such a
heart-rening picture. It's a little girl
cuddling a puppy. And I looked at it and
the person who sent it to me said, "Look
again." And then I realized it was AI.
>> Yeah.
>> And and they then sent me a picture of
the same image, but it was a little boy
this time holding the puppy. And it made
me realize how easy it is now using AI
to generate heart-rending, powerful
images, emotional images that play to
our prejudices. Yeah.
>> And that's the next question, I guess,
which is how do you how do your experts
figure out if something is an AI image?
I I'm constantly getting sent
highresolution images of incredibly
complicated looking spacecraft hovering
over international cities and it's it's
clearly I mean I have to always default
to the assumption that it's an AI
generated image these days because some
of them are just absurd. They're so
sharp. But um isn't there the risk that
we might be throwing the baby out with
the bath water?
>> Yeah, I I think I got a couple thoughts
on that. Yeah, it is. It is absolutely
we take it as a real responsibility on
this show. We have, you know, for lack
of a better expression, we've created
this monster of a show where we've told
people
we can determine what is real and what
is fake and what's a hoax. It's in our
tease material for God's sakes.
So, we've we brought the pressure upon
ourselves and I I'm happy to say that I
just think we have an amazing team of
people.
Um, so far
I we have not been fooled, tricked or
anything else. Uh, but to your point,
the fakes are getting to be so good
right now that uh we have got to be
extra vigilant. I think we're up to that
challenge. And the other thing I I think
I'm proud of with the show is if we ever
get it wrong, if we ever need to take a
second look and revisit it and say, "Uh,
we kind of we kind of muffed that kick,
right?" We'll go back and we'll say so
and we'll give we'll give another team
or our team a second look at something.
Mick West has done that on on a couple
of occasions, disagreed with our verdict
and said, "Damn it, I'll show you that
I'm right and you're wrong." He's done
that. But that's that's the kind of
freewheeling show that we have right
now. and you know kind of our dedication
to try to get this right. But it is a
huge challenge for you. It's a huge
challenge for us going forward. It's a a
huge challenge for the audience. I think
even in this episode, this premiere
episode tonight, we've got a couple of
situations where we're able to call it
out definitively. Uh but I I I think at
this point we've gotten to a place where
folks are trying to fool us. And and in
part that's a bit of a compliment,
right? We're a successful show. we're
we're taking on, you know, all comers in
the space. So, for folks to try to
purposely, you know, trick us or
whatever else to get the aha on us,
you're not as good as you think you are,
um is part of kind of a a pat on the
back to the success of everybody who's
worked on this show for so long and so
hard. Now
there's a know all fringe among the uh
the sort of the community of
eupfologists in particular but
particularly across the whole paranormal
spectrum who confidently assert that
shows like yours including I I spoke
once to Brandon Fugal from the
Skinwalker Ranch series
>> and and I said to him you know people
say your show fakes stuff. Yeah. And he
he he actually said categorically it's
written into the contract that we will
not fake stuff and people will be dealt
with if they do. Under no circumstances
are things faked. Do you have any
guarantees on your show that there's
nothing faked?
>> Uh I have uh let me think about that. I
don't think that there's anything in in
my host contract that says that. I I
will tell you I would be surprised
I would be surprised if that was even
necessary with our show. Honestly, I I I
they're a different show.
Um I I love that they believe so
passionately in the work that they're
doing, but
you know, for us to get it wrong and for
us to fake it,
I I just imagine the backlash on that. I
just imagine the reputational damage to
all of us.
So that's why I I I say to you, I don't
know that there's language. I I would be
surprised if if anyone felt it was
necessary.
>> I know there's no language like that in
in my deal with the channel. They asked
me specifically, they they said to me, I
said, "Look, I'm going to come to this
thing skeptically."
>> And they said, "That's what we want.
That's why we're calling you." Um so no,
and I and I my executive producer is is
is one of the best. And so I I would be
really surprised if if that language
were anywhere in in in any of our
working documents. And certainly, you
know, there's there's our mission
statement doesn't allow for anything
like that. So, but I understand,
you know, in this day and time, if we're
talking about, you know, having to vet
stories and clips that might be faked, I
understand the question. I'm not
offended by the question at all. Not at
all.
So, you actually did a special edition
on the skinw walker run and did you
actually did you get to go there
yourself?
>> I did. I did. So, um we've jumped out of
the studio a couple of times uh once and
and both of them have been kind of in in
an assist to those really good shows.
Um the fact is Skin Walker didn't any
need any help from us. They were they
were huge hit to begin with. So, it was
kind that they thought there was
something that we could do together and
invited me out and and it was a terrific
time and I got to meet the guys and I
got to to see how they go about their
work and and I love how passionate they
are about what they do and how they
believe. Um I I I think they are
skeptical as well and and I I don't
>> Did you Did you see anything anomalous?
I didn't I wasn't there, you know, I I
wasn't there long enough um and and I
wasn't there at at the right moment,
right, to to see something and I don't
think um I'm trying to think of whether
or not they were even in production at
the time. I think they did this as kind
of a special for us, right? um and and
they didn't fire up, you know, all the
rigs that they have and everything else,
but but we had really wonderful
conversations with them and they let us
walk the grounds and, you know, it was
it was a way for, I think, the audience
to to see, you know, where they operate
and how they operate in a different
light and it was able opportunity for us
to toss through some some some really
good clips from our show that people
have sort of said, "Hey, let's see that
again."
We kind of did the same thing with uh in
Florida for uh the Bermuda Triangle show
uh which is another really hot show for
History Channel. They they're just
producing hit after hit and I think u I
think we did a a week of shows there or
at least a couple of of episodes there
that we think really showed off um the
team their work and it gave us an
opportunity to feature some of the clips
from our show that are tied to the
Bermuda Triangle as well. So that was a
really good opportunity. I hope we get
more opportunities to do that, not just
for the shows, but for our show as well.
>> What's your take on the Bermuda
Triangle? Having been there, seen it for
yourself, looked at historical evidence,
what conclusion have you come to
personally?
>> I I I think there are I think there are
gravitational forces in and in in our
atmosphere.
And I I I think that there are moments
when perfect storms align.
Um we have wonderful meteorologists on
our show. Juan Hernandez is is the name
that comes to mind right away. And and I
I I think that that some of this is
really possible, right? I I don't know
to what degree this is natural forces. I
don't know if these are uh extra forces.
Um, I don't I don't know if uh we're
talking about pilot error in many of
these instances,
but I mean it's there's too much in that
space that's that's gone on for decades
not to be curious about what
similarities there are in these stories.
So I, you know, part of the thing that I
try to do with all of this is to keep an
open mind but remain skeptical.
One of the things that I learned early
on in my journalism career, ironically,
covering court cases, was how bad humans
are being witness.
>> I I mean, I I was amazed in court cases,
often murder cases that I was covering.
And witnesses would totally contradict
each other on basic issues like the
color of clothing or the location of a
person when the terrible incident
happened. And it made me realize that
we're very unreliable. that that one of
the problems we have all of us humans is
we fill in gaps. That's right.
>> Our brain our brain finds solutions to
discoordination by filling in the gaps
and coordinating things that may not
have happened. Is that a problem? Is
witness evidence a big problem for you
guys in trying to figure out whether
something's credible or not?
>> Well, well, think about how our format
um essentially teases that out. So, our
format says, "Send us what you've
captured.
Send us what you can't explain.
Don't try to fill in the gaps in your
knowledge with speculation.
Send the clip to us. Let us take a look
at it. We'll give you a call. We'll sit
you in front of a camera and we'll have
you walk through your experience." One
of my favorite parts of the show is when
we get people who have sent in clips and
then, you know, are willing to sit down
and talk about their experience because
it's it's it's that human exchange at
that point. They're essentially saying,
"Hey guys, hey Tony, hey team, I
captured this. I don't know what in the
world this is. Would you please take a
look at it and and tell me what it is?"
So, um, I our format sort of, you know,
teases out this this idea that you don't
know, you you think you know, but it's
probably explainable. And what I love is
that when we offer up the verdict to
whoever has sent us the clip, nine times
out of 10, they're willing to accept it.
There are times when they've pushed
back, but they're willing to accept it.
I love that that people come to us with
genuine, you know, curiosity about what
it is they they've captured, right? And
you hear it sometimes in the expletives
that we beep out in the clips.
>> Yeah, it's funny. I I I was looking at a
lot of your proof is out there videos
and um one of them that really sticks in
my mind that expresses this dilemma
about the credibility of witnesses, how
how on earth you make that judgment.
There's one a father and son, you might
remember this one in Quincy, Florida in
May 2012. They shot video of a loping
primate looking creature on a thermal
imaging camera in the woods in Quincy in
Florida
>> and the father and son had gone out on a
search for the Bigfoot. So just as a
sort of an evidential thing, how much
for example in a case like that does the
fact that they went out looking for the
and that they happened to find one, you
know, they were clearly already
believers, does that color your
perception of how the video comes to be
analyzed?
>> No, not at all. Not at all. Um,
what I love is, you know, we we're both
journalists. That's that's that's how we
made our bones, right? Um, and so, uh,
that doesn't that doesn't color our we
were able to sort of it it's it's really
sort of the bedrock of the show that the
show has to be viewed as being, you
know, honest in this. It has to be
viewed as a show of integrity or we're
off the air. I mean I mean, how many
times do you think we can get it wrong?
I mean, just flat out wrong. How many
times do you think you know what I'm
talking about? How many times as a
journalist can you just get it wrong? uh
before I think quite quite frankly often
I mean I think this is one of the things
I think we in the mainstream media often
aren't very good at which is publicly
correcting our mistakes but I I I can
remember having arguments with a boss at
a major newspaper and saying we should
we should really correct this we're
actually wrong you know and it it
annoyed me because I think people
respect you more if you're rigorous and
honest and say look I just screwed up
>> well I will tell you I don't I don't
give us that much rope I mean I don't I
don't give us, you know, three strikes
and you're out. I I just don't um I I
think, you know, what we're saying is
uh to trust us. That's what we're
saying. And and so we will take a look
at a second look at a clip. We've had
instances on the show where people said,
"You got it wrong." They're not saying
to us, "You were sloppy." They're not
saying to us that that the your experts,
you know, are no experts at all. You no
one's saying that to Kaku, right? Um and
so, you know, there there are times when
there have been real questions and we've
taken a look at it. I mentioned a couple
of times when Mick West has said, "Yeah,
I we've got debate on the show and
people uh can honestly disagree about a
clip." And then, you know, that's kind
of left to me and our team to say, well,
where are we coming down on this? And
there are plenty of instances on the
show where we've said, you know, we're
not sure about this.
>> Well, actually, that's that's that's one
thing I was going to do with this
Bigfoot one, the Quincy, Florida one I
was talking to you about. It it actually
got me in and I liked the way your show
dealt with it.
>> I was going to ask you, how did we deal
with it?
>> Well, the the the structure was
interesting because you had Steve Carl,
who's a Bigfoot investigator. Yep.
>> And he gave the story credibility
because of course there's been a history
of sightings of Bigfoot in that area.
>> And then you had a professor of anatomy
who came who said it's it's very likely.
>> Yes. Yes.
>> Um very likely not a human in a suit.
And I hadn't thought about this. It's
because they said that because it was a
thermal imaging camera.
>> Um the black thermal signature indicated
that you know it it was a you know a
proper object. It wasn't somebody
dressed up in a suit.
>> And then you had a wildlife biologist, I
think Stephanie um Stephanie Mer.
>> Yes.
>> And and she said it looked like a a
primate. And and you even talked to an
anthropologist who looked at the walk,
that kind of classic grouch show.
>> And um I what I liked was that at the
end you kind of threw your hands up in
the air and went insufficient evidence.
And you do that occasionally. Sometimes
you just admit, look, we just don't
know. So there are times when people
think of that as a copout, right? But
but listen to how you just described our
process. I mean, listen to the people
who we've brought on as experts to take
a look at this and they've disagreed.
Um, and that's what I love about the
show. And if we get to a place where we
just can't say with any real confidence,
I love that we're not afraid to say
that, right? and and and that that ends
up, I think, winning us a lot of
credibility points with the audience. At
least I hope so.
>> Well, I'll give you another one that
also got me because I had been fooled by
this video and you guys showed me how it
was not a real video at all of anything
paranormal. And it was a show you did
called F Five Freaky Paranormal
Occurrences. And it was a police chase
video of a car that appeared to drive
through an intact fence. And you know,
it seemed to de dematerialize through
the fence and and drive off into the
forest. And the cop car video appeared
to show this car had gone through a
solid fence. And I was I can remember
seeing this a few years ago, sitting in
bed with my wife and going, "Wow, get a
look at this. This is incredible." And
what you showed was the local sheriff
had gone back and done an analysis and
it turned out that on that particular
part of the fence, the wire was on the
opposite side. So the car had actually
gone through the fence, the wire had
lifted up, probably scraped over the top
of the car, come down again, so that by
the time the cop car got there, it
looked like the fence was intact. I
>> I just thought it was brilliant. I
thought it was great.
>> Well, I I I love that story. And you
know, forgive me for not remembering,
you know, how we dealt with it, but I
love that we dealt with it in a very
smart way. You know, one of the things
that we're thrilled about is that we're
up over a hundred episodes now,
right? I mean, it's it's a wonderful
thing, but but I I I love that you're
describing our process and that you've
watched the show and and you know how we
approach it. Um, we get videos like that
a lot. You know, the other thing that we
see a lot is is is people thinking
they're seeing,
you know, I think there's a example of
it in the premiere episode where uh this
phenomenon called paridolia where people
see kind of what they want to see in an
image and a cloud this that the other.
It it's one of our one of our most
recurring videos and it it it also shows
you how our minds work, right? And in in
many of the videos where paridolia
paridolia is at work, people are seeing
images of of spirits and Jesus and this
sort of thing. And one of the things I
love in the show is when
when people's spirituality and their
their sense of faith attach it itself to
the videos that they're sending to us
and and then that becomes a little
sensitive when we take it apart in the
way that we we took apart that video of
the car and the fence and everything
else. And then you know it's left to me
to say I know what you thought you saw
but it's not and I'm not questioning
your faith or your belief structure or
anything that but it it's one of those
moments that I really love about the
show and that intersection between what
people really firmly believe in their
hearts and how it attaches to what they
believe spiritually is is one of the
things I I love most about the show and
and one of the reasons why when we can
and the video is really good. uh the
stigmata videos are are I I I know
something that really resonates with the
with the audience.
>> It's funny. I I've I did a story many
years ago about Mother Mary McKillip who
um was given a saintthhood here in
Australia by the Vatican and I was very
very skeptical about claims of
paranormal phenomena. But what struck me
was seeing the process of how the
Vatican investigates alleged paranormal
phenomena. And I was blown away
basically by how rigorous the science
was and how determined they were to find
hoaxes and to rule out the the
possibility that this was somehow faked.
And I have to admit at the end of it I
sat down with my crew and as you would
know Tony the most skeptical people on
the planet have film crews and uh the
cameraman is always telling me you know
you can't believe that person Ross but
in this case they were completely of the
belief that this was a genuine miracle
and um we'd all basically had our
beliefs and our biases jolted. Um have
you had that experience yourself with
particularly things like stigmata and
>> Yeah. Yeah. I I love that story because
that that's something I I have not had
that opportunity to to actually hear or
or or watch the Vatican work through
that process. Um I I would love to do
that at some point. That sounds really
really fascinating. I I have not had
that experience. I I have I have not I
can't say that I have but I'm always by
it. I is there some is there some area
of the paranormal of the mysterious that
you've not yet investigated that you'd
like to delve into? What's the area that
intrigues you the most?
>> I I will tell you the the area research
that I really love and you know you've
heard me talk about this one area where
you know people's faith and and what
they see and what they believe you know
kind of collides with the physical
world. I I I love that love that stuff
to pieces. The the other area of
exploration that I am really intrigued
by is what's
what's really beneath our oceans and how
far can we ultimately go and what's
down there? What ecosystems are down
there? I, you know, it'll feel alien to
us. It may not be extraterrestrial, but
it'll feel alien to us.
And so I I think I I would love uh more
exploration of the depths of the sea.
Someone asked me the other day if if you
could if you could skip dimensions, if
there was such a vessel that was created
and you could skip dimensions, would you
be willing to do it? Would you be able
would you be willing to sort of um leap
into another galaxy and would you be
willing to go through a black hole and
this that and the other? And that took
me right back to my Star Trek days right
as a kid.
And I said, 'Yeah, I think I would. You
know, I'm a man of some age now and I've
lived a really good life and and had a
world of experiences and, you know, I I
think I'd like to do that. I' I'd like
to explore, you know, strange new
worlds. I'd love to do that and and
hopefully be able to report back on it,
but if not, if that's where the journey
ended, I'd be really happy with that. I
mean, and and that I would not have said
that before working on the show.
One of the one one of the things I
respect your show for is the fact that
you do change your mind. I mean you do
invite the audience to come back to you
and challenge and I think to confess an
interest here. I think you may be aware
that reality check has a particular
interest in the subject of UFOs, UAPs.
>> And it's it's really interesting because
for me a turning point journalistically
where I thought criy there really is
something to this. There was a whole
series of roadblocks for me u moments or
road signs where I realized this is
real. But for me it was the ODNI report,
the office of the director of national
intelligence. And I noticed you
acknowledged this in one of your shows
that to have the US government after
years of denial and dismissiveness
towards the UFO phenomenon. All of a
sudden they're coming out and they're
saying, "Yep, turns out UFOs are real.
Yes, they are a flight safety risk." And
yes, they are a potential national
security threat. H how important has
that been for you and your show in terms
of making your focus, if you like, on
doing more UFO focused stories?
>> Well, it is one of the staples of the
show from day one. I don't know when we
started this and started talking about
the show in 2020 that we anticipated
there would be congressional hearings on
this. I don't know that we did. Uh we
knew that there was work going on. We
knew that the late Senator Harry Reid
was really pushing this area of of
investigation, the former senator of
Nevada. So, uh, we knew that there was
work going on, but I don't think we
could have anticipated
uh open hearings to the public. I don't
think we anticipated uh those meetings
points in in the open session
where there was mention of a material of
some material or of a clip where the
next thing was well let's take this up
in close session.
That's the moment right let's let's
let's take this up in close session. So
>> I mean I just yesterday um there was a
guy who was a former deputy director of
the d of the director of national
intelligence of the office of national
intelligence and he admitted that when
the spooks and the Pentagon came in to
give a briefing to the director of
national intelligence on the UAP mystery
he was asked to leave the room and yet
he was cleared to the highest secrets in
the country. There's something there,
isn't there? I mean,
>> yeah, absolutely. And and I think it's
just a matter of time. Now, now look, I
you know, I sort of I sort of gird
myself a bit here. And and and the
journalist and the skeptic in me says,
you know, there are a number of reasons,
and you know this, why this material can
go into closed session. And one of those
reasons is because we're talking about
military secrets.
>> Sure,
>> we understand that. and and I've seen
enough of this material and and you
know, you've been working in the space
for longer than I have, so you've seen
even more of it to to make note of the
coincidence that a lot of these
sightings are in close enough proximity
to military installations where you've
got to ask some questions about that.
So I I I think ultimately a lot of this
material
is knowable and it is knowable to
you know the military and those higher
up in the food chain. But I I think even
in in that subset,
I think there is still material that
that the government is is dubious of,
has real questions about
that that may be uh the intelligence of
other nations, but may be possibly
extraterrestrial and alien in nature in
in nature. Again, I don't
>> Yeah, I don't think
>> a lot a lot of people scoff. Forgive me
for interrupting. A lot of people scoff
at the idea that governments are capable
of hiding secrets. Um I you you probably
know the term to put it politely in my
office when I was in taught to be an
investigative journalist they told me
always assume a screw up before a
conspiracy that that conspiracies are
highly unlikely.
>> They're not smart enough to cover it up
and Yeah. Yeah. They're not smart enough
to Yes. Yes. Yes.
>> But isn't the truth that governments can
cover things up if they want to? I mean,
there's been shocking things that have
happened. I I I remember um reading with
horror about the radiation experiments
on American citizens, MK Ultra, you
know, the CIA's illegal experiments on
American citizens in the 1970s. There
are things that are done by governments
sometimes that are plausibly deniable,
often in the name of national security,
that are kept secret from the public. I
I guess at the heart of the UFO mystery,
do you to the belief that it's possibly
foreign adversarial technology or do you
think it is possible that what we're
talking about is a nonhuman
intelligence?
I'm not there yet. I am I am if I'm on a
scale,
I'm I'm I'm leaning more toward uh
military applications.
uh something based in science,
nations being competitive with one
another, but that's scary enough.
>> And I think that's a good point, Tony,
for us to conclude on the fact that the
host of the proof is out there will
remain a determined skeptic until he's
got the evidence in his face. Tony
Harris, thank you so much for joining
reality check and good luck with the new
series of the proof is out there.
>> Ross, brother, what a pleasure. Thank
you. Thank you so much for your work in
this space and of course, thanks for
having me.
>> All the best, mate.
