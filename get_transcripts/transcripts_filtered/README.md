# Filtered Q&A Transcripts

This directory contains filtered Q&A transcripts generated by the pipeline.

## 🔍 How It's Populated

Automatically created by:
```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_pipeline.py --ross --step filter
```

Or directly:
```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/filter_qa_transcripts.py
```

## 📁 Contents

This directory will contain copies of transcripts that match Q&A filter patterns defined in your run config (e.g., `config_runs/ross_coulthart.json`).

For Ross Coulthart, this typically includes videos with:
- "Q&A" in the title
- "Q and A"
- "Questions Answered"
- "Viewer Questions"

## 📝 Git Tracking

**All `.txt` files in this directory are gitignored** because:
- They're derived files (copies from `../transcripts/`)
- They're large and would bloat the repo
- They can be regenerated by running the filter step

Only this README and `.gitignore` are tracked.

## 🔄 Regenerating

If this directory is empty, just run:
```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/filter_qa_transcripts.py
```

Current expected count: ~15 Q&A transcript files for Ross Coulthart.
