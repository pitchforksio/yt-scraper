It's a News Nation exclusive. There's
obviously something going on in Arizona
along the border areas hunting UFOs.
Now, this ex Border Patrol agent is
going public for the first time with
neverbeforeseen video. What they are, I
I have no idea. Examine the evidence.
There's an old straight ahead of me. And
search for secrets. It's over the border
of the United States. It's a genuine
mystery. Hunting UFOs, the desert sky
mystery. Saturday at 8, 7 central, only
on News
[Music]
Nation. Good day and welcome back to
Reality Check Q&A. I'm your host, Ross
Kulart, and it's that time of the week
where you, the viewer, get to ask me the
questions. And what a couple of weeks
it's been. It's been a very busy time in
the study of the phenomenon. Hello,
Megan. Here to help us ask those
questions is my colleague in crime,
Megan Orata. How are you, Megan? Ross, I
am fantastic. We have some great news to
share right off the top. You have a new
special. You've been working really hard
on this and it is airing this Saturday
at NewsNation. Hunting UFOs: The Desert
Sky Mystery with Ross Colt. Saturday,
8:00 p.m. 7 central. Let's play a little
clip from that special. We're going into
the field to investigate allegations
that the US may well have recovered
nonhuman technology. And to that effect,
I'm on my way to meet my very first
source. His name is Bob Thompson, and
he's never spoken on camera before.
Thompson's an Army veteran who spent 14
years with US Customs and Border
Protection. Eventually, he became part
of the Arizona Air Coordination Center,
which monitors the airspace along the US
border. It was always a challenging job.
And then he says it got weird. There's a
lot of stuff that's been cited out here.
Everybody come go ahead and grab
yourself a chair. So, it's coming up to
midnight and Melinda's been seeing
increased activity. Anomalous objects
doing extraordinary things and often
escorted by dozens of military
helicopters. So, we're hoping we might
see some tonight. There's two together
right there coming up. Yeah, there's a
military chopper coming up. Oh, wow.
So, this is what you're talking about.
There's a military chopper in proximity
to those objects. So there's these two
here and there's these two right here
and he came up right behind them. So if
nothing else, Belinda, I'm satisfied
that I'm seeing a lot of
choppers hovering and
moving with purpose around other objects
which are demonstrably
anomalous. So I'm very excited to bring
you this story. Um, obviously we all
know there's been interesting phenomena
seen for years all over Arizona. And one
of the things we did as part of this
investigation was go to the Mexican
border and catch up with our
correspondent there, Alli Bradley, to
see if we could plausibly explain what
was being seen in this guy, especially
by uh Customs and Border Protection,
Homeland Security surveillance to see if
it could be explained perhaps as cartel
organized crime operations. As you'll
see, we were able to rule that out. And
the intriguing thing is our research led
us to a location very near Sedona. And
it raises the very serious question, is
what Melinda Leslie and many other
people are seeing in and around the town
of Sedona something that is part of a
broader coverup? Is there a deep
underground military facility near
Sedona? That's what we've been
investigating and it's been absolutely
fascinating getting to the bottom of
this mystery. I think there is something
out there. I do believe that the
evidence is overwhelming that there are
apparent tests going on involving
government US military helicopters uh
accompanying some kind of craft. And I
for the life of me can't believe how
obvious it is that it's sitting there in
plain sight right there near the the
counterculture town of Sedona. I guess
though when when you talk to people in
the intelligence community they often
say the best way to hide things is to
hide them in plain sight. And boy that's
what they're doing. All right Ross. And
there will be a live after show after
the special airs on 87 central on
Saturday. Um we'll also be posting the
full special on YouTube. and everybody
you see in this special, we will air
their full long form interview with Ross
on Reality Check as well. Looking
forward to that and looking forward to
answering any of your questions in the
live after show chat. Our first question
is from Allison. This came over with
email. I recently took a trip to New
Mexico and had a UFO guided viewing
where we saw orbs zipping about at high,
even a few at lower altitude. In the
middle of the show, two orbs went off by
themselves and began flashing a very
fast sequence of multicolored lights. I
asked our guide about it, and he said
he's seen it before, but doesn't know
what it means. They moved way too fast
to be drones. Is anyone trying to
decipher these signals if they are that?
That's a really good question. They are
um I've spoken to people who've recorded
those flashing lights. They've recorded
the color of course and obviously the
frequency and the duration of the
lights. At the moment, nobody's telling
me they've been able to decipher any
kind of message from them. Um, it is
intriguing though, isn't it? I mean, the
fact that you can go out into the New
Mexico desert as we have done for this
week's special in Arizona, and you can
see anomalous objects all the time. I
mean, they're right there under our
noses and they are they're displaying
these weird phenomena and I think it
deserves to be studied and uh yes, I
agree it should be investigated. I just
don't know any more about whether or not
there is in any intended messaging
behind the frequency of the lights
involved. Okay. And this question is
about our episode from last week.
Greetings. So Ross, we are indeed
thankful to all your sources, but do you
and your cohorts get the feeling that
Jacques Valet is either being very
choice with his words or is possibly
afraid of sharing more? Because to me,
it seems he knows a lot lot more than
he's letting on. Kudos on the work,
Reek. Well, Jacques does know a lot
more. I mean, he's quite open about
that. And um one of the issues of course
with anybody who worked on um uh NIDS
and a lot of the Bob Bigalow work is
because they were at different times
under contract with the Defense
Intelligence Agency, they were
constrained by national security uh
undertakings and uh you know I I tried
exploring with Jacqu as you saw in the
interview the fact that there was a
clear intent uh with the Bass project
that came out of um OSAP, the uh DIA
funded investigation at Skinwalker
Ranch. There was clearly an intent at
one stage, and I've heard this from
multiple people, for some kind of
technology, NHI technology, possibly a
craft, I'm told it was a craft, to be
handed over by Loheed Martin to Bigalow
Aerospace. And that's why when the New
York Times wrote its story in 2017,
Leslie Kaine and Ralph Blumenal talked
about the fact that there was a very
highly secure warehouse being built for
the purposes of storing nonhuman
intelligence technology and materials.
And nothing came of that. And the reason
we now know that nothing came of that is
because the um allegedly the CIA
intervened to stop the transfer of that
technology because they were worried
that it would leak. And so yeah, I mean
I think it's really interesting with
Jacques and a lot of these people that
have worked with Bob Bigalow and the
NIDS and then the Bass and the OAP and
the ATIP investigations because the
simple fact is that they have they've
they've crossed over at times into that
dark world. They've dealt with people
like James Latsky who was the um defense
official that they were liazing with and
obviously at different times they have
to hold back on what they know and it's
one of the great frustrations but at the
same time I I sense from the UAP
community u an idea that it's my
obligation as a journalist and it's
Jacques's obligation as a commentator
just to word vomit out everything they
know uh even if it jeopardizes or or is
perhaps reckless with important national
security secrets. I know this may sound
old-fashioned, but I do I re reiterate
this often. Um I do think it's important
that journalists respect national
security issues and secrets and and
there are things that are done in the
best interests of the United States and
five eyes allows like my country
Australia that are worthy of protection.
And maybe that's one of the reasons why
Jacques has to sort of tow that
difficult line. I thought he was quite
forthcoming in his interview. I would
have loved to have got a lot more from
him. It was a privilege to be able to
speak to a man who is frankly the elder
statesman of eupfology.
Absolutely. Um our next question. Hi
Ross. As a fellow Aussie, I'm very
interested in any information you have
about Pine Gap and its activities around
UAP. Are we likely to get any
whistleblowers on this facility? Also,
is there any movement to press our
government for UAP disclosure? Really
appreciate your continued investigations
into this subject. Many thanks, MJM.
Okay, for those people who don't know
what Pinegap is, Pinegap is the most
important US military base outside the
continental United States and it is
located slap bang in the middle of
Australia near Uluru otherwise known as
Air's Rock near Ellis Springs right in
the middle of central Australia. And the
reason it's there, it was built
originally in the 1960s as a station for
receiving the downlink signals from the
DSP satellites, the Defense Support
Program satellites that were recording
um ballistic missile flashes on the
surface of the planet. They were
intended as like early warning uh
satellites to to signal whether a
potential foreign adversary was
launching a missile. and they've been an
important part of the US strategic
nuclear deterrence for the last 60
years. What has happened at Pine Gap is
it's become an absolutely essential arm
of the Five Eyes Alliance. Um, I've seen
uh serendipitously uh I was taken
through a place called Garden Island in
central Sydney and I was uh at one stage
escorted by a very senior minister in
our government and taken somewhere where
I probably shouldn't and shown the feeds
coming into a naval facility in central
Sydney which are also the feeds I
understand that go through Pine Gap and
they were literally satellite feeds from
drones and from satellites in real time
coming in through Australia on their way
to America and they were mindblowing. Uh
it was quite extraordinary to see the
level to which Australia as an ally of
the United States is plugged in to the
intelligence feed from America and that
for some reason has attracted the
interest of the phenomenon. Yes, there
are many recorded incidents that I write
about in my book, In Plain Sight, uh, an
investigation into UFOs and impossible
science. And, um, you will find in there
my recognition of the fact that there
have been multiple incidents reported by
both American personnel and Australian
personnel. This is a a joint facility
uh, where in some cases orbs have been
seen. I spoke to one person who
described seeing an orb at one stage
tracking the fence line around the
facility and then as they watched it
literally went through the wall of the
building and then there were um CCTV
feeds of the object whatever it was
passing through other walls and going
into allegedly the more sensitive parts
of that facility. And I'm told this
happens quite a lot. I've spoken to
Aboriginal communities that live very
close by on the other side of the
so-called McDonald range and they tell
me they see weird stuff in the sky all
the time and that Pine Gap does seem to
be a bit of a hot bed of UAP activity.
And for those of you who love a good
conspiracy theory, I'm sure there will
be many people who remind me of this.
Um, the remote viewers that were
operated by the CIA during the 70s and
the 80s, they picked a location called
Mount Zeal, which is only about 120
kilometers west of Pine Gap, as being
the alleged location for a base for
nonhuman intelligences. I've never been
able to confirm this. Um, I've had a
look at the area. The bottom line is you
don't see anything other than scrub and
dirty outback desert. Um uh but I am
intrigued by Pine Gap. It is the most
secret facility in Australia. Uh
government very rarely talks about it
and yes it is a hot bed of UAP activity.
And to answer the broader question from
the the person asking the question, um
Australia really has its head in the
sand on the UAP issue. The government
officially has no interest in UAPs. It
declaims any knowledge at all in
monitoring them. And it's going to be
very interesting to see because we know
that Dr. John Klosski, the current ARO
boss in evidence last year, he
acknowledged that he would be reaching
out to Five Eyes Partners to ask them to
start collecting UAP evidence. And it's
going to be very interesting to see
whether the Australian government acesed
to that request. At the moment, from
multiple questions that have been asked
in our parliament by different people,
it's quite clear that we're still in an
era of denial and ridicule and taboo
directed towards the UAP subjects, even
though Australia has its own fair share
of UAP sightings. Okay, Ross, we have
another question on a different
incident. Hi, Ross, thanks for your
continued efforts on this subject. What
are your thoughts on the Welsh Pinchk
incident? Kind regards, Rich. Oh, this
is actually a very interesting story.
The Penturk case. Uh there's a woman
called Kez Clark who lives in the little
town of Penturk in Wales H in the United
Kingdom and she reported uh gosh, I've
forgotten how many years ago it is now,
but it's within the last 5 or 10 years.
She reported the most extraordinary
sighting of an anomalous craft that was
clearly uh not of local manufacturer.
gigantic object uh hovering over her
field adjacent to her home. It was
allegedly witnessed by a neighbor of
hers and then as she watched it was
being chased by military aircraft, both
British and apparently US military
aircraft. And it's interesting. I
preface everything here by saying I have
never been able to go to Penturk to
investigate this case and I would dearly
love to. Uh, I've just never been able
to get the money to travel to the United
Kingdom because it costs an enormous
amount of money to travel to these parts
of the world to go and do this kind of
investigation. And I do think the Pentk
is worth a look. There are people in the
Welsh UAP community who think that the
Pentk is all nonsense and that it's all
been exaggerated and that it's not true
and that we shouldn't take it seriously.
I am not so sure. I do think it is
worthy of further intense investigation
that examination. I've spoken to Cas
Clark and I've also spoken to other
witnesses who are a little more reticent
about going public. One of the things,
for example, that I found especially
interesting about the Penturk case, and
I've been able to confirm this for
myself, is that where the object, let's
be neutral about it, allegedly crashed
in the forest, it is the case that the
British Forest Service came in and
excised every tree in that area on the
speurious grounds that they were getting
rid of some kind of fungus in that
forest. And what's interesting is um
Cass and one of her colleagues went in
and recorded what looked like some kind
of burn mark on the tree. There is also
evidence to suggest that ordinance was
fired, perhaps even surfaceto-air or um
air airto-air missiles that were used to
engage this object. And what's beyond
any shadow of a doubt is that there was
a substantial covert military operation
in the forest around Penturk in the
weeks after this incident. So there's
something going on and I do think it's
worthy of further investigation. There's
a great YouTube video about it called I
think the Penturk incident that's on
YouTube. It has me intrigued. I've
spoken to Cass about it. She's adamant
that what she saw was real and she'd
love to have it properly investigated.
One of the big things that confounds
these kind of stories is just getting
the resources to be able to investigate
them. And it's a dream of mine to go
back there and to do a proper dig. What
I have no doubt about is that the United
Kingdom has been involved in UAP craft
retrievalss with the United States and
there is an increment of the British
special forces that are involved in
doing these operations and I suspect
Penturk might be one.
Okay, thank you. Uh our next question,
Megan and Ross, thank you for dedicating
your time to these Q&A episodes. If we
consider the broader field of psionics
to include the possibility of
communication with or even a direct
address from NHI, it seems that such
phenomena may manifest as what has been
termed channeling. Ross, do any of your
sources slashcontext take any so-called
chneled material seriously in their
understanding of the phenomenon at
large? Thanks, Alan W.
Yes, they do. I mean, I talk all the
time to people who claim to be in
contact with a non-human intelligence,
and yes, they claim to receive messages.
Um, I I've lost count of the number of
people who who claim to receive uh some
kind of message. More often than not,
it's a kind, benevolent message.
Sometimes it's very specific. Um, I I
just don't know. I mean, how do how does
one verify these things? Often they're
telepathic. Um, so somebody is claiming
that they're receiving a message in
their head. It's almost impossible
scientifically to verify or measure or
assess that. Um, but yes, there are many
people who say that they are channeling
messages from the phenomenon. And there
are people that I'm talking to who
contact me frequently who claim that the
phenomenon is talking about ramping up
its overt presence on the planet and
that the drones that were operating over
the east coast of the United States and
other parts of the US and different
parts of the world with the beginning of
a bigger show. I'm yet to see that
evidence surface. And one of the things
I often do is I go back and have a look
at what people who report channeling
tell me and see whether any of that has
actually come to pass. And I have to say
at the moment I'd probably give it about
a one out of 10 in terms of veracity and
accuracy.
Okay, Ross, thank you. That was the last
one for today. Oh, that was easy. Thank
you so much, Megan. Well, I hope people
enjoy this special uh uh in uh Arizona
and um I I hope if anybody has any
information by the way about deep
underground military bunkers, military
facilities that might be being used for
the storage and research into the uh
phenomenon of NHI technology. As
incredible as that may sound, I am very
very interested in hearing from you.
Well, they can send that along with
their questions to reality check

No worries. Thanks very much, Megan.
