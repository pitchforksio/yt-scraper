Good day and welcome to Reality Check.
I'm your host, Ross Kulart. Today I'm
going to talk to you about the new movie
Age of Disclosure. The much long-
awaited UAP film featuring a brace, I
think 34 so-called government insiders
telling all about the UAP mystery. It's
a film made by Hollywood producer
director Dan Farah and Lou Alzando. Lou
was very key early on as an executive
producer in bringing people from within
the defense intelligence establishment
and getting their agreement to appear on
camera. Uh, and it's great to finally
see this film finally making it to both
a limited theatrical release and to a
streaming release on Amazon Prime. So,
you'll be able to see it from the 21st
of November this year, 2025. Um, it's
going to be released in selected
cinemas, very, very limited in
Washington DC, New York, and LA. And,
uh, it's also going to be appearing on
Amazon Prime for rental or purchase. And
I strongly recommend everyone here watch
it and tell all your friends, tell your
neighbors, tell everyone, watch the age
of disclosure.
Not because it's going to tell you, a
UAP knowledgeable person, anything new.
If you watch reality check, you'll
already know a lot of what the age of
disclosure film discloses.
What is significant is what the age of
disclosure film will tell to the average
Joe citizen. It's one of the first
opportunities for a wellmade,
definitive, objective UAP film to
present the evidence for the UAP mystery
to the general public in a way that
hopefully will seize their imagination.
So, what do we know about it? We know
that it's positing the conspiracy theory
that I don't think is a conspiracy
theory because that's almost a pjorative
that there's been an 80y year cover up
of a covert UAP nonhuman technology
retrieval program of craft and biologics
bodies um that the US government has
been and continues to be involved in the
retrieval of nonhuman technology and
trying to reverse engineer
And boy, I think what what the biggest
weight in the film are the people who
appear. We don't know the name of
everyone in the film who appears because
we're all running blind to some degree.
There there's only a few very limited
accounts of what people saw at the South
by Southwest festival in March this year
uh where there was the premiere. Uh but
we do know that some very key officials
are appearing in the film. Um, it was
filmed in great secrecy. Uh, David
Grush, by the way, doesn't appear in the
film. I've spoken to David about this.
Uh, but what's interesting about the
film is that it certainly corroborates
and more than confirms everything David
Grush told us here on NewsNation in 2023
and in his testimony to the Congress.
Um,
there is a trailer was released in
mid-occtober. Uh, might run a little bit
of it here. It's a pearler of a trailer.
Really gripping.
>> We've had repeated instances of
something operating in the airspace over
restricted nuclear facilities and it's
not ours.
>> These are otherworldly things that are
performing maneuvers that have haven't
been seen.
There's a whole
>> I have seen with my own eyes non-human
craft and non-human beings.
>> This is so secret. There have been very
few people in our entire government that
have been allowed or provided access to
it.
>> Even presidents have been operating on a
need to- know basis, but that begins to
ramp out of control.
It's not acceptable to have secret parts
of government that no one ever sees.
>> People have been hurt protecting and
hiding this information.
>> Some people claimed it would cost them
their lives if they spoke out about
these things.
>> You had information being locked away
that could change the trajectory for
species.
This is the biggest discovery in human
history.
Um, it's an hour and 40 minutes and
worth worth buying or renting. I
strongly recommend it. Get your
neighbors to watch it. Have a have a
have a neighborhood suburban party. Have
a street party. Invite your skeptical
neighbors along and get them to watch
this film.
So, the key strength of the film as it's
been described by people who've seen it
is that it's got this 34 key insiders of
sitting politicians, retired admiral,
intelligence veterans. Um, some of those
insiders are already well known to us.
One of them, of course, most prominently
is Lou Alzando, the former uh head of
the Pentagon's ATIP program, who
investigated UFOs inside the Pentagon.
And one key quote from Lou that I
thought was a good place to kick off is
his comment, quote, "It's ironic that
the people who created the stigma to
cover this up, labeling anybody who
talked about it wacky and nuts
unintentionally, ended up creating a new
national security threat, which is the
stigma itself." And he's quite right. I
mean, Lou speaks, frankly, as somebody
who's worked in a very senior role in
counter intelligence. And I think he
knows a lot more about the legacy
program than his security constraints
allow him to let on. And the fact that
he's talking about how the stigma, the
ridicule, the taboo attached to the UFO
subject is actually now one of the
biggest security threats is of grave
concern. One of the most consistent
messages that comes from people who
appear in this film is the warning that
we are asleep at the wheel, that we're
not thinking about the implications of
this technology and this knowledge of a
nonhuman presence and that we need to
actively publicly prepare for it. That
is why there is a mandate for the
current president, President Trump and
his administration to do the right thing
and speak openly and honorably and
restore honor to the people, the men and
women who've been responsible for
covering this up. I presume out of some
misguided idea of heeding their national
security oaths for the last 80 years.
Let's go to the basic origins of this
story. The Constitution of the United
States requires that Congress be
properly and fully informed about all
expenditure in all government programs
funded by the taxpayer. That's in
article one of the constitution. That
allegedly has not been happening with
the UAP retrieval and reverse
engineering program. The allegation is
that there is a multi-billions, probably
multi- trillions cost program that US
taxpayers have been footing the bill for
for many, many decades that has been
improperly, illegally, and perhaps
criminally withheld from the knowledge
of the American public. There are very
very grave allegations including of
murder, intimidation, bullying, threats,
all manner of corrupt and improper
behavior that have allegedly been used
by members of the intelligence, defense,
and private aerospace community to
improperly suppress and keep this
secret. There is an allegation still to
be confirmed, perhaps one day it will be
or won't be by the White House, whether
that there is some kind of an executive
order that was put in place back in the
days of the Eisenhower and Truman
administration, perhaps a pee, a
presidential emergency action directive,
which has been kept secret, which allows
this to be kept secret from Congress.
But I would love the constitutionality
of that to be assessed by the Supreme
Court or some super uh you know superior
juristp prudence people in the United
States legal system. I don't see how
presidents can be kept in the dark and
that's the key issue of all of the
people who appear in this film. They
would no doubt regard themselves as
patriots. They want the truth to be told
and this is their ambit position where
they state very very clearly that there
is a cover up that it's gone on for far
too long and it's time for the public to
be told the truth. Cue the White House
disclosure by the end of the year. Don't
we all hope? So the next up of course is
Chris Melon, the former deputy assistant
secretary of defense for intelligence
and security and uh a UAP advocate par
excellence. Chris brings a certain pan
style to the UAP subject and has
consistently written and spoken publicly
about the need for more open disclosure
and transparency.
And in a featured clip with Hal Putoff,
he warns of existential risks from UAP
NHI tech outpacing human control,
alleging there are DoD programs that
hoard crash debris. He claims that there
are multiple crash retrievals confirmed
by insiders and emphasizes that there is
a secret ongoing cold war for supremacy
with this UAP tech being waged between
Russia, China, and the US. Those are big
words from a person who's been very
close to the top of the US national
security establishment. A man who no
doubt has been read in to many special
access programs and other secret
compartmentalized secrets inside the US
defense and intelligence community. Hal
Putoff also appears in the show. He's a
quantum physicist of course and the
former CIA DoD head of the remote
viewing program also involved as a
scientist with OAP and ATIP. Um he talks
about how the age of disclosure is
brilliant because it goes quietly behind
the scenes, talks to 34 people and says,
"Okay, if you all come out at the same
time, you don't have the stigma
associated with speaking out
individually." And so you can make a
great step forward. And I think that's a
very astute comment from Hal. He's
absolutely right. Some of the people
that appear in this film probably would
not have appeared on their own. Key
point on Roswell, the 1947 alleged crash
of a UAP or perhaps two UAP craft in
1947.
Halputoff affirms there are key
individuals who should know who say the
crash, the Roswell crash was real and
there were bodies.
And he also discusses how there are
reverse engineering failures that have
led to black project deadends. Now, this
is one area of the message from age of
disclosure that I'm a little bit
skeptical about. Frankly, I'm not buying
it. I do not accept that the US has not
made significant advances with retrieved
UAP technology. And I do suspect that
the um original 2014 2015 approach by
generals Mccasland and Kerry to Tom Dong
uh through Loheed Skunk Works and um
John Podesta in the White House at the
time that this was all part of an
attempt to try and control the the
narrative, a kind of a limited hangout
uh where they would disclose yes there
are UAPs. Um, yes, we have recovered
technology, but you know, we haven't
been able to develop it that much. And
don't you worry your tiny little heads.
We're doing our level best, but we
haven't been able to reverse engineer
much of this technology at all. I'm
afraid I'm not buying that. And if
that's the message from Age of
Disclosure, I am extremely skeptical
about that message. And I know and I
respect Hal Putoff and Eric Davis and
others who who are pushing this line.
I'm not sure I accept it. And they are
patriots. They're good men, but they
are, of course, constrained by their
national security oath and by the
intentions of the gatekeepers who
control what knowledge is allowed to be
released on the legacy program.
The other significant interviewee in
this film, and I cannot overstate this,
even though he gave his interview before
he achieved the exalted positions he now
sits in, it's incredibly significant
that Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State
and National Security Advisor acting in
the Trump administration, appears in
this film and says what he says. Marco
Rubio breaks his silence to some degree
on the classified briefings that he's no
doubt received. And I can tell you as
national security adviser, he would have
received briefings long after, of
course, he did the interview for this
film. And those briefings would no doubt
have told him the full truth on the
legacy program. He called for
declassification and states that leaders
from both parties view the age of
disclosure film as a stepping stone to
bring the truth out. I guess at this
point I should flag there is a rumor.
There is a rumor doing the rounds and
I've heard it from multiple people now.
Not from the horses mouth, not from the
administration. Nobody in in in the
administration has said this to me, but
there is a rumor doing the rounds that
once the age of disclosure film has
aired, there may be movement from the
White House. Now, I'm not holding my
breath because even though Mr. Trump did
make promises during the campaign to be
more open and transparent with UAP
videos and photographs and documents and
to help us get to the truth of the UAP
mystery. There has been a deafening
silence from the administration on UAPs.
Now
I am told by people very senior in the
administration I can put it like that
that there is a desire to get to the
truth and they've just been distracted
by the Middle East by Ukraine by the
economy by the need to act on more
urgent pressing domestic matters and
that they are turning their head to the
UAP issue. I guess I've got a onetrack
mind. I don't understand why any
incoming president faced with the
probability of being briefed about the
biggest secret in human history wouldn't
immediately scurry to the White House
press room podium and say, "Ladies and
gentlemen, I must apologize. We have
been lying to you for the last 80 years.
We did not tell you the truth. I,
President Trump, as your new president,
will tell you the full truth because I
believe in transparency, openness, and
accountability. and I am going to expose
the deep state once and for all
definitively for the people that they
are because they have lied to you. Who
knows that day may one day come. I'm not
holding my breath. But it is significant
that Marco Rubio called in his
pre-administration interview for UAP
declassification and transparency. So,
let's hope that the acting national
security adviser has exercised sway
inside cabinet and persuaded Donald
Trump to show leadership and resolve on
the UAP issue. Another person who speaks
in the film is Senator Kirsten
Gillibrand and um she focuses on the
national security implications, the
possibility that foreign adversaries
might secure some kind of an advantage
over us in securing access to this tech.
And this is a consistent theme in the
film that basically if it is true that
there is nonhuman intelligence
technology in the possession of the US
and other nations, we damn well better
be the best country at at reverse
engineering it. I've said publicly on
reality check before that my
understanding is that the Chinese have
stolen the march on both Russia and
America. that America has made advances
in anti-gravidics and energy systems,
but that the Chinese are way ahead. And
this is the concern that the over
secrecy, the stigmatization that's been
attached to this subject for decades has
actually hindered our ability to be
properly scientific in achieving the
results that we want to achieve.
Hopefully, we'll get to the truth soon.
Tim Burchett also appears in this film
and he cheerily asserts that this film
is the smoking gun we've waited for. 34
insiders can't all be wrong. And he's
concerned Tim is about the threats to
whistleblowers and alleges the DoD
flipped the script on UAP hearings to
minimize disclosure. And I agree with
Tim. I think what's happened in Congress
is a disgrace. Congress has been
knobbled. Tim hasn't been knobbled. God
bless him. He's still sticking his head
up as are Nancy Mace, Anna Paulina Luna,
um Eric Berles, and other prominent
commentators on the need for UAP
transparency and oversight in Congress.
But they are fairly junior
representatives and sadly the people in
control of the committees and the key
opinion leaders in the Congress have so
clearly allowed themselves to become
supine supplicants to the gatekeepers
and the national security state. The
people who should be rattling the cage
and demanding to know why the
Constitution's constraints on oversight
have not been heeded by the gatekeepers
have rolled over and let the generals
and the intelligence chiefs tickle their
tummy. So this is why we need leadership
from the White House. And here is
President Trump's opportunity to
definitively prove his claims of the
deep state and to come out with the
evidence that we all know he has of
what's really going on with the UAP
mystery. Another person appearing in
this film is a former director of
national intelligence, James Clapper.
I'm not fully apprised of what he knows,
but um James Clapper of course is a
controversial figure because uh he has
previously admitted that he perhaps
inadvertently, how does one do that?
Misled the Senate about the extent of
government surveillance. And maybe this
is his mere culpa. Maybe this is the
former DNI coming in ready to tell the
full truth about UAPs.
Um he has made the comment that the UFO
files were buried deeper than nukes
which I think is quite a telling
comment.
It's interesting also to know that the
DNI uh Tulsi Gabbard has also avowed her
desire to have transparency on UAPs. So
the woman who is currently the director
of national intelligence in the Trump
administration has been very outspoken
about the need for disclosure.
Tim Galedet also appears in this film.
He's the former Rear Admiral, retired
Rear Admiral, a genuinely lovely human
being and a good friend of this program
who was the head of Noah and who has
been very outspoken about the mystery of
um unidentified submerged objects and
the possibility of there being even
alien bases underwater.
Um he's spoken very enthusiastically
about his participation in this film and
he has testified on oceanbased UAP
recoveries and again the same concern
about this global competition for this
UAP technology. There are apparently 20
plus military insiders and intelligence
insiders who also appear in this film.
And there are claims of how the uh there
are five confirmed UAP crashes,
including the 1947 Roswell crash and the
1996 Vajinha, Brazil crash, which we've
talked about very recently on reality
check with filmmaker James Fox. talks
also about the retrieval of nonhuman
biologics, recovered alien bodies.
Believe this if you will. I am so
looking forward to the day if and when
government admits all of this is true
and these smug smiles will be wiped off
the faces of those skeptics and
debunkers who have for so long resorted
to ridicule and stigma and taboo rather
than responding logically and
objectively on the subject of UAPs.
It's going to be very interesting to see
if the White House does come out and
make a public statement in future months
or years how that group of determined
debunkers are going to behave. I hope
they all crawl back to their holes and
never stick their heads out in public
ever again because they will deserve
vilification and approprium. And I think
also we should be asking if there are
people who have improperly, illegally,
criminally withheld this knowledge from
the public knowledge, why are they not
going to be tried for treason? It's
going to be a very interesting decision.
If the White House does decide to be
open on this issue, what will it do?
Will it do what I strongly sadly suspect
they should do which is offer a truth
and reconciliation commission where just
like South Africa did after apartheite
Nelson Mandela in an act of
extraordinary magnaminity decided to
offer amnesty to anyone who'd been
involved in crimes against the state in
return for their truthful depositions
about what they knew. And it was a very
healing process. I got to witness it as
a journalist. And even though I hate the
idea of people getting off scot-free for
their crimes, if crimes have been
committed, and I know they have been, I
actually suspect it's going to be a
necessary part of the healing process
for the American people and the American
government in coming to terms with the
magnitude of this cover up.
What do we know about the film? We know
that it's following the historical
coverup from the 1940s through to the
present day. Um, we know that it gets
into the grush hearings and the way that
stigma, ridicule, and to have been used
to try and control the public narrative.
I think it's going to openly discuss the
fact that there's been a control group.
It's going to talk very strongly about
the arms race between the Russians, the
Chinese, and the Americans for access to
and control of this technology and its
knowledge. And the key point that comes
out of the age of disclosure is a call
to action, a bipartisan call where
people from both sides of the house,
defense and intelligence insiders urge
disclosure, warning that secrecy has an
expiration date.
Now, there's no physical evidence of
craft shown. It's testimonydriven with
dramatic reenactments and archival
clips. But what's good about the age of
disclosure, I'm told, is that it is an
objective, solid retelling of a story
many of us know well, but which probably
99% of the viewing public have
absolutely no idea about. And that's
what this film is targeted at. Um the
UAP commentariat community of course has
come back slugging it basically saying
it's um it's not really going to tell us
anything new but I'm tending to agree
with people like Jay Stratton who calls
it the most credible landmark
contribution to disclosure. Um, I'm
hoping that it makes a big hit in public
consciousness and most importantly, I'm
hoping it wakes up people in the current
Trump administration to do the right
thing and push for transparency and
disclosure. Um, the commentary that came
out of the South by Southwest Festival
airing was strong. People said they were
stunned, they were shocked that it was a
highly credible film. It got pretty
positive reviews. But on Rotten
Tomatoes, it's not doing too well. I I
think it's getting sixes or sevens on
Rotten Tomatoes. Um, but there is of
course a push back from the intelligence
community and I think we need to put it
on record that it is so flaming obvious
that the intelligence and defense
community are clinging on with their
fingernails running as much
disinformation SCOPS as they can,
putting down as quickly and as
early as possible for the film to try
and cause as much mischief as possible.
Guys, it's not going to work. the public
are going to be interested in the
revelations that this film makes. And if
the kind of response that I'm getting on
the street is any guide, people are
waking up. There's a wisdom of the crowd
here. This film will play a key role in
waking the public up. People are
suddenly going to start talking, I
think, about the UAP subject in a
credible and informed way. They're not
going to immediately default to ridicule
and contempt.
Um, Lu Lzando has a few quotes that I
think are worth reminding people here
that this is talking about a cover up,
the most successful disinformation
campaign in the history of the US
government representing 80 years of lies
and deception.
As Lou says, we discovered there
actually was another deeply hidden and
much larger UAP program.
One of the key arguments behind this
film, Age of Disclosure, is whether the
UAP mystery is a threat or not. And this
film allegedly pushes very much the
threat narrative. And that's coped a bit
of a flanging from some in UAP circles
who suggest that the UAPs, the NHI are
nothing but benev benevolent, cuddly
aliens that want to wish us well. And I
don't think it's being entirely fair.
I've always thought that when people
like Lu Alzando and Chris Melon talk
about threats, they're talking with the
perspective of people who are schooled
in national security and counter
intelligence. And in that world,
anything that is conducting
intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance on us, and we don't know
anything about it is by definition a
threat. We're not saying it's coming to
kill us, that it's going to war against
us, or that it has malign intell
intentions, but frankly, until we know
more about it, we should treat it as a
potential threat. And I've never really
taken any more from Lou Alzando's
comments than that.
But on UFO Twitter and social media
commentary, there's been a bit of a
backlash that essentially suggests that
this film is pushing a narrative, a CIA
big budget false UFO threat narrative.
And I'm sorry, I'm not buying into wacky
conspiracy theories like that. Um I I I
do think that um the public should be
skeptical about the idea that there is a
threat necessarily that these are aliens
coming to get us. But I don't think we
should discount that possibility. The
bottom line is as we know from slide 9
which is a document that was presented
to an under secretary of defense which
talked about the capacities and
capabilities of the NHI. We know that
the NHI have the capacity to manipulate
human cognition, to actually tap into
human consciousness, to physically alter
what we see, to manipulate our
perception. Anything like that, frankly,
is a threat in my book. And frankly, I
don't care whether it's a dark
conspiracy or not. We should be treating
it with caution. And I can respect and
understand why the national security
establishment might be cautious. Where I
am skeptical is the extent to which they
try to play down the extent to which the
United States has been able to reverse
engineer this technology. Apparently,
we're going to be told that that program
has largely been unsuccessful.
I'm not buying it.
There are many, many interesting quotes
from people in the film, but I think
it's probably best that I let you watch
the age of disclosure and make your own
judgment. And what we'll probably do is
have a future reality check where we can
have an open discussion where I can hear
from the audience what they thought of
it. And more importantly, let's see what
the White House says in response.
Because frankly, after the um film airs
on the 21st of November, it will be
airing in Washington. Maybe they can
secure President Trump a special seat in
whatever cinema it will be. Or maybe
they can have an airring at the White
House. It's going to be an absolutely
key tipping point decision. How the
president, how the national security
adviser, Marco Rubio, how the DNI Tulsi
Gabbard, and how Cash Patel at the FBI,
John Ratcliffe at the CIA, how they all
choose to respond to the allegations
made in this film by key opinion leaders
from the defense, intelligence, and
political community.
This is not some idol UFO documentary
made by a bunch of amateurs. This is a
serious Hollywood film. It's making
very, very serious allegations
and I think they deserve to be listened
to. So, let's talk about Age of
Disclosure after you've all seen it. And
I hope you enjoy the viewing. Thank you
