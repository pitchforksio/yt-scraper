A lot of people ask me if I've been
threatened. Um, no, not really. I mean,
I I think thankfully because I have an
audience, uh, you know, you guys are
interested and engaged. I think the days
when the national security state or
whoever is responsible for this cover up
felt that they could intimidate somebody
like me, uh, uh, I hope well and truly
over because we would broadcast it far
and wide if anybody tried to gag us. In
fact, bring it on, guys. We We'd love a
fight.
