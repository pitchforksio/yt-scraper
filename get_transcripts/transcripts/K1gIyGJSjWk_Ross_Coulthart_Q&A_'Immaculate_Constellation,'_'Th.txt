Good day and welcome back to reality
check
Q&A where you get the chance to put the
blowtorrch on your host Ross Kulart.
Good day and also hello to Megan who's
going to ask me the questions. Hey Ross,
good day to you. We are actually going
to start with something from you this
week. You posted on Twitter,
whistleblower goes public on Immaculate
Constellation, alleges covert US program
monitoring UFOs. You were one of the
first to talk about Immaculate
Constellation. What did we learn here?
Okay, this is a a very very important
story. This is a a guy called Matthew
Bran who uh I think at the at the moment
he's working for the state department
but he was working for the defense
department when he became aware of a lot
of confidential UAP related files that
were on the Jwix server, the
confidential servers used for
communication inside the defense and
intelligence community. and what he
discovered formed the basis, he
confirms, of the immaculate
constellation document that was tabled
in Congress last year. It's a very very
important fact that Matthew has now gone
on the record and admitted his
credentials to my friends and colleagues
George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell because
there were a lot of people suggesting
that Immaculate Constellation the
document was essentially a hoax a
forgery and that it didn't amount to
much more than a hill of beans. Now, we
know from Matthew on the record that
Immaculate Constellation is in fact a
special access program code name that
was brought in after Lou Alzando went
public in 2017 with the fact of the
Pentagon's um ATIP UAP UFO investigation
program. And boy, some of the stuff that
Matthew says is really important. He
he's essentially
describing the worst nightmare I think
for a country like the United States
that prides itself on democratic
accountability. There are so many very
interesting quotations from Matthew and
there's a couple here that really worry
me. One is it's a parallel reality. The
secrecy apparatus is all persuasive.
It's not just in the intelligence
community governing their world. It's
not just the military protecting their
operations. It's not protecting
diplomats and leaders as they conduct
their work sometimes in very dangerous
places. It, and he's referring here to
the legacy retrieval and reverse
engineering program, it has been allowed
to corrupt and infest every aspect of
our society to serve the interests and
whims of a very elite select few.
Amusingly for those of us at NewsNation
who broke the Dave Grush story, Dave
Grush's name apparently was
absolutely verboten. He was a non-person
inside the defense department. You
weren't allowed to raise, he says, Dave
Grush's name in any of the chat groups
relating to this issue. He um he he
raises a lot of concerns here about the
unnecessary secrecy attached to the
program. He says, "The secrecy that has
been defended is at the cost of, in my
mind, human dignity, freedom, and
progress. It is no longer permissible or
acceptable in my mind to continue this
course, to deprive another generation,
not just of Americans, but humanity of
their birthight to know who they are,
where they came from, and what's with
us."
We have as a country, he says, allowed
ourselves to be penetrated, co-opted,
and
corrupted by an internationalist force
that serves their interests and views
nations, peoples, as tools, and means to
an end. This is really serious stuff.
He's basically suggesting that there's a
a state outside the United States, a
cabal of people, an internationalist
cabal, I presume business related, which
is essentially protecting the secrecy of
the program and doesn't give a hoot for
democratic accountability. And I know
I'm giving a long run to this, but I
think it's really important that we um
we go into some of the detail of what he
describes. One of the things that he
describes among a lot of the videos that
he says he saw on the system, very clear
videos of obviously some kind of
anomalous object. He can't confirm, of
course, that they're nonhuman, but
whoever is operating these craft has
highly advanced technology. And there's
a moment when he describes um an object
hovering over the Pacific Ocean at night
off the coast of Camchatka, which is a
Russian secret military base. And there
are several Russian naval intelligence
vessels uh on the ocean clearly
apparently waiting for this object to
arrive. And there's a still color image
obtained presumably by a US submarine or
some kind of surveillance device at sea
level which shows a large black triangle
floating in the air. Now, the
implications of that are actually quite
concerning because if it's something the
Russians were waiting for, it implies it
might possibly be Russian, which begs
the question, have the Russians de
developed technology ahead of the United
States? and is part of the reason for
the secrecy surrounding the Immaculate
Constellation program and every other
aspect of the legacy program is part of
the reason for this secrecy because the
US doesn't want to admit what we've been
saying here on reality check for some
time which is that there is a grave risk
that we are being overtaken by our
foreign adversary rivals because of the
secrecy surrounding this issue. Many
scientists in the program have been
telling me for some time that the
secrecy in this program is confounding
advancements that could give America a
foreign adversary advantage. And this is
the issue. There is a genuine concern in
the scientific community in the black
world that we are shooting ourselves in
the foot. And this is something that
President Trump needs to respond to. The
big question in my mind is I look I'm
pretty sure I've actually engaged
communications with Matthew Brown
previously. Um I suspect he reached out
to me at one stage last year and we did
have preliminary conversations and I
know he was at the time incredibly
nervous and trying to wrestle with what
he was going to do. At the time he
wasn't going to go public on TV. So,
it's a big step that he's made this move
and I can only assume it. He's done it
for the best of motives. The man is a
patriot. He's a good human being. He
needs to be protected as he's revealed
in his interview with Chris Sharp for
Liberation Times and also the one with
um uh George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell.
Actually, Chris took his stuff from
George and Jeremy's interview. He's
concerned about retaliation. He's
concerned about threats. and he's also
concerned about the possibility that he
could even be executed for revealing
what he knows. This is serious stuff.
Congress needs to do something about it.
We can't have a situation where, as has
happened with Jake Barber and David
Grush, Congress just goes and moves on.
This has to be investigated. This is a
senior person in a in a senior
government position with a top secret
compartmentalized security clearance
revealing things that rave raise grave
concerns about America's national
security. Let's get it investigated.
Let's put him in front of a public
hearing and let's also find out why he
wasn't allowed to give evidence at the
hearing that took place last year
because my understanding is that he was
hoping he would have been able to. Let's
protect this person. Let's let our
Congress people and our senators know
that the revelations of this person
matter and the White House needs to do
something about what he's said. Well
said, Ross. Our next question comes
about another whistleblower um from
Lizzy. Hi guys, first thank you for all
your incredible work and ongoing efforts
in this field. I have been following
intently since the start and support you
all the way. My question is what has
happened to the age of disclosure
documentary with Lou Alzando. It seems
to have never been released, fallen off
the face of the earth and no one's
talking about this. There's also been no
updates from Lou. Ross, can you fill us
in? What do you know? What's happened
and why? Thank you.
Okay. So, there was a premiere of the
Age of Disclosure documentary at the
South by Southwest festival and the
producer who uh is one of the
co-executive producers on Age of
Disclosure, Dan Farah. The other
executive producer is actually Lou
Alzando. Um the the producer Dan Farah
made it very very clear that he would be
seeking ideally a cinematic release or
some kind of streaming release. And
sadly these things take time. You you
have to find a um uh a a a cinema chain
or indeed a streamer that is prepared to
pay the money to run the documentary.
And I I agree. I think that it's taking
unnecessarily long time. There's huge
public interest in this issue. One of
the things that I know is featured in
the documentary and we know this because
it's been written about by people who've
seen the film, I think Marrick von
Renamp has written about how a former
CIA director James Clapper or maybe he
was DNI director of national
intelligence um has actually gone public
with what he knows about a non-human
intelligence. This is far too important
for this to sit on the shelf for the
next few years waiting for a cinematic
release. Let's get it out as fast as
possible. I do think um I can understand
and I sympathize with Dan and Lou in
their efforts to try and get release for
this film. Um I just hope it comes out
very soon. I share your frustrations.
I'm aware of what's in the film. I know
it makes extraordinary dramatic
allegations from first person very very
senior people who've worked at the
highest levels of government and
national security and intelligence and I
think it's time the public saw the film
but one of the problems we have and this
is something I'm facing as well is in
Hollywood a lot of the producers have
their heads up their butts on this issue
of UAPs they are really resistant to
giving it the coverage that it deserves.
And even though you, the public, the
watching public, think this is a story,
and by golly, I know the level of public
interest in this issue, as a journalist,
I have never in my long career as a
journalist covering any subject of
interest. I have never ever had the
degree of public interest in an issue as
much as I have on the UAP issue. It's
taken me, it's taken News Nation
completely by surprise. and we're very
gratified by it. It's why we have a show
like this. We know there is an audience
out there that wants this story and by
golly, we're going to bring it to you
and I'm sincerely hoping that Dan and
Lou get an opportunity to run Age of
Disclosure very soon. By the way, gents,
if you would like an arena to run it, we
would be very, very happy to run it on
NewsNation. I can guarantee you a slot.
We will run it tomorrow for you. So
there's the offer.
All right. Next question comes from
Ruben. Hi Ross. I grew up LDS Mormon in
an area filled with NASA Loheed and
Boeing employees. And an old friend once
mentioned that her son who worked for
the Navy said they preferred hiring
Mormons for sensitive positions because
of their lifestyle. Given that
background, have you ever heard of any
connections between the church and the
UAP phenomenon? Thank you. Wow, this is
such a good question and I'm dying to
answer this one. Yes, I have. Mormons
are incredibly over represented in the
program in the legacy program. I have
lost count of how many people that I've
met uh who are working in the legacy
program who are people of Mormon
background and they're great people. And
I just wonder whether it's got something
to do with the fact that Joseph Smith
when he received the um forgive me if
I've got my my narratives wrong. Call
them tablets or or um metal sheav. The
the whole story of Mormonism is based
around the idea that Joseph Smith was
basically given a lot of the early ideas
of Mormonism in metal tablets that were
provided to him by a UFO. So maybe for
people of faith, the idea of being able
to verify this by getting involved in
the legacy program is important. I'm
told also by more cynical people inside
the program that there is in fact a very
good reason for using Mormons and it's
because they are extremely good at
keeping secrets. I can assure you that
not all of the Mormons are keeping
secrets. Some of them very kindly are
speaking to me. So yes, uh there is
definitely a link between the Mormons
and people involved in the program. I I
don't know 100% why, but I suspect it's
largely because some of the hidden
facilities underground are in Utah. I'll
leave it at that. Um, you might be aware
for those of you that follow my Twitter
that I have flagged recently that we are
doing a story that will be touching on
the significance of secret underground
facilities across the United States, in
particular in one state, and you might
just want to keep an eye out for that.
You'll be starting to see promos very,
very soon. We intend discussing the
location of a known underground defense
facility that we believe is involved
working with retrieved nonhuman
technology. Okay, Ross, this next
question is coming from JP. Hello. Here
is my question for the next Q&A with
Ross. Hey, Mr. Big Dog, and I assume
he's referring to you here. Last week,
you touched on the Harold Malgam
interview on Jesse Michaels. To me, one
of the most fascinating revelations was
the connection between the Angletons and
the Knights of Malta. What are your
thoughts on the Knights as it pertains
to the UFO mystery? And where could we
begin to find out more? Thank you. Oh,
boy. Now, this is a goodie. Now, look, I
was privileged enough to be able to
speak to Harold through his uh daughter
Pipper before he passed. And yes, I am
aware that Harold had a real focus on
the role played by the Vatican, which
after all is the body that essentially
uh gives agency to the Knights of Malta.
and um he believed very very strongly
that the Vatican was in this subject
matter up to its ears, particularly the
retrieval of the magenta 1933 UFO craft
that was retrieved by the fascist
Mussolini government and eventually
secretly handed over to the Americans.
And I understand the interesting thing
is you got to know a little bit about
your American espionage history. Alan
Dulles, who went on to become the um uh
director of the CIA at one of its worst
times when it committed some of its
worst criminal acts right through to the
horrible revelations that came in during
the Church Commission uh in the 1970s.
Alan Dulles was based in Switzerland
during World War II and he was part of
the OSS, the precursor to the CIA. And
so we know that Dulles was involved with
the Vatican and the Knights of Malta in
that retrieval. And we also know that
James Jesus Angleton who went on to
become the notorious counter inelligence
boss of the CIA. He was in Milan. So you
had two of the people who are
principally involved in some of the
dirtiest secrets of the CIA working for
the OSS at this time in the late uh mid1
1940s when the knowledge of the magenta
craft was passed on to uh the Americans
by the Vatican. And yes, it's central to
what Harold Mongram alleges that the
Knights of Malta are involved. And one
of the things if you actually go through
the number of people who are members of
the Knights of Malta, it is mindblowing.
If you look at senior people in the air
force, senior people in government,
there are an incredible number of
connections involving the Knights of
Malta. And yes, it has crossed my mind
that when you have people like Matthew
Brown, for example, the latest
whistleblower, talking about how this is
an internationalist cabal of people, are
they using the Knights of Malta as
cover? And is the Vatican involved in
assisting this cover up? I think they
are. And I've long thought the Vatican
is much more involved in protecting this
secret than people care to admit.
Multiple sources have told me, even
though the Vatican denies this, that the
Vatican has long been aware of non-human
intelligence and that their files, their
archives are replete with details of UFO
sightings, UAP craft sightings going
back as long as a thousand years. If
there is one institution in the world
that sits outside of the American
National Security State that's the most
likely suspect for facilitating how this
happens, it's the structure of the
Knights of Malta and the Vatican. And I
do not think it is any coincidence that
Dulles, Angleton, and a plethora of
people, including people who are serving
in the US National Security
Establishment right now, are members of
the Knights of Malta. Um, supposedly
it's just an honorific title and just a
fancy title that you can put after your
name. But is it? That's what I'm
investigating and I'm very very
interested in hearing from anybody who
has any more information on this. Okay,
our next couple questions. These are
coming from the Rendlessham Forest
interview that we posted last week.
Hello Ross. Watched your interview with
Carrie Hesseline. Fascinating interview.
Ross, do you think the Pentagon or some
rogue organization funded by black
projects is abducting and terrorizing
people with the Milabs military
abductions that happen from time to
time? What do you think the purpose of
such an operation is and its end goals
if true?
Okay, so there's two issues here.
There's the Rendlessham case of December
1980 and there's the issue of what are
called myabs, military abductions. And
it's long been a part of UFO UAP
mythology that the US military is
somehow secretly involved in abducting
people and for some reason assisting
non-human intelligence beings entities
in some kind of scientific study or
activity with abducted humans. I for the
life of me don't know if that's true or
not. What I can tell you is I've spoken
to multiple people who claim to have
been victims of my lab abductions and I
I I don't know what to make of the
abduction phenomenon. I've recently
interviewed Jacques Valet who has
speculated about this in his forbidden
science journals and you'll see my
interview with Jacqu Valet shortly. What
is interesting is there is a
commonality. There is a theme to a whole
lot of people from all over the world
who are describing being in this kind of
weird realm where they're allegedly
being abducted. There are alien beings
there allegedly. And there are men in
uniform, American military uniform. And
this isn't just one or two people that
have spoken to me about this. This is
dozens of people. There's a huge
commonality to these reports. Let's go
to
Rendlessham. I do think there was
American involvement in prompting what
happened at Rendlessham Forest in
December of 1980. Increasingly, I am led
to the view that there was an operation
underway. I've been aware for some time
that a huge C5 Galaxy uh aircraft
arrived several weeks before the
Rendlessham Forest incident at RAF RAF
Woodbridge, which is one of the two
Royal Air Force bases that were in use
at the time by as a joint American
British base. And I'm told that there
was a special tarmac set aside that was
strengthened for the C5. Oh, and by the
way, it was at the very end of the Raph
Woodbridge base, right adjacent to the
Rendlessham Forest. And yes, there are
witnesses that I'm aware of who, for
various reasons, were able to pass
through the forest at that time, and
they saw activity underway. It has also
been suggested to me, and this has been
fairly recent, that there was a psionic
summoning operation being operated
experimentally at Rendlessham at this
time. And that what the United States
was doing was using people with alleged
telepathic psionic abilities to try to
summon and perhaps operate a craft, a
nonhuman craft. And it has been
suggested to me that what happened at
Rendlessham was what's called a link
loss. That whoever the psionic was that
was operating the craft, they lost the
link. And that might explain why the
craft landed briefly in the forest and
then was able to then be retrieved. It
took off eventually whilst allegedly
people were watching it. And this
happened apparently over multiple
nights. I'm intrigued by the Rendlessham
case and I'm looking forward to a film
that's being made at the moment called
Cattle Green which is going into some of
this detail. Uh I'm very excited to be
able to see that film hopefully later in
the year. Uh I'm also hoping to talk in
more detail to Colonel Charles Halt who
has contacted me recently and expressed
an interest in wanting to give more
detail on what he knows. hoping to speak
to him shortly and maybe we can bring
him on reality check. So yes, my labs
are interesting. I don't think
Rendlessham was a case of a military
alien abduction. What I do think it was
though was an incident where there was
allegedly a psionic link loss. And
that's telling because if it was
happening in 1980, that's 45 years ago.
45 years ago, they were using psionics
to engage with non-human craft. Think
about that. Think about what they might
have achieved in the 45 years since. All
right, Russ. This next question comes
from Tristan. Is anyone ever going to
mention the Todd Mortyn case that same
year? I think that case is as
significant as it is so multiaceted, not
far away, and around the same period.
Wow. I'm so pleased somebody's asked me
about the Todd Mortyn case. I'm I'm a
West Yorkshire boy. I was born in West
Yorkshire where Todd Mortyn is located
and I've always been interested in this
case. So there was a copper there was a
policeman called um Alan Godfrey and in
June of 1980 he was involved in a really
weird case where the dead body of a man
called Adam Demsky, I can't remember his
first name. It wasn't George Adamsky. A
dead body of a man called Adamsky from
memory was found on the top of a a kind
of a coal slag heap in this mining town
called Todd Morton. And apparently he
was buck naked and his hair had been
shaved and um there was a real mystery
as to how this guy had gone missing.
He'd been missing for 3 days and there
was never any explanation for what had
happened. roll forward to I think it was
November of 1980, which is one month
just a few weeks before the Rendlessham
case. What was happening? Um Alan
Godfrey himself was on patrol in the
town of Todd Morton and what he
describes is I think he was responding
to something about I mean this is a
farming town, mining town. There were
cattle apparently that were wandering
around the town and so he went to
investigate and I can't remember the
full details but apparently he was
abducted and that's the that's the
account that he gives. I'm hoping at
some stage to be able to bring Alan
Godfrey on the show not least because I
love his Yorkshire accent and I've heard
him interviewed before. I'm fascinated
with the Todd Morton story because
you've got this death involving a man
found on top of a slag heap in June of
1980 and then in the November almost
getting towards the same time as the
Rendlessham incident, you've got this
weird thing that happens to a policeman
where he's allegedly abducted. Um, I'm
fascinated with the case and I've heard
Alan tell his story before and I find
him highly credible. All
right, Ross, thank you. That is all the
time that we have for today. We will
take more questions next week. You can
email us reality check@newsnationow.com.
Thank you very much, Megan. And please
