Good day and welcome back to Reality
Check Q&A where you get to ask me, your
host, Ross Kulart, the tough questions.
And here to help me in the excoriating
analysis is Megan Arada. Good day,
Megan. How are you,
>> Ross? Just doing great. How about you?
>> Very well, thanks. Obviously, we're in
the middle of a drone flap right now.
Goodness gracious me. It's happening
again.
>> Yep. We will start right there, Russ.
Um, President Trump, he has addressed
this. Um, comments were short and sweet,
but it's about the mystery drone
incursion in Denmark. There's a lot of
speculation going around that this is
Russia. President Trump said, "I know
about it. They don't know what
happened." Viewer Andrew reached out to
us on X. He said, "Ross, do you believe
the New Jersey drone incursions and the
recent Denmark incursions are all
related or connected?" Asking because
the drones are still flying over my
house in New Jersey.
>> Good question. Uh, we don't know yet.
And that's the whole point. Why are
governments repeatedly, as happened in
Konus in the United States, asserting
that these objects, I'm not going to
call them drones, are in fact linked to
foreign state actors like Russia or
China. Where is the evidence? As the
president has said, they don't know what
it is. Okay, so what are we talking
about? We're talking about how in
Copenhagen, Denmark on September 22nd
through to 23rd this year, there were
sightings of two to three large
unidentified
objects near the Copenhagen airport in
Denmark. It shut down that airport for 4
hours and about 100 flights were
disrupted and there were similar
disruptions. There were follow-on
disruptions at other airports around
Scandinavia.
Now, the Danish authorities immediately
referred to it as an attack, and they're
pointing the finger at Russia. And
there's suggestions that because there
was a bulk Russian carrier crewed by
Russian crewmen about 80 km away that
somehow these dastardly Ruskies have
been able to insert a drone into some of
the most secure airspace in Denmark, a
country which has some of the world's
best radar, and somehow get those drones
in without detection and out without
detection. This strains credibility.
Now, obviously, there's the beginning of
the disinformation. They're now trying
to claim it might have been civilian
aircraft, and there's the usual
suspects, the squawking seagull crowd,
who basically suggest that we're all
hysterical and that it's all a big
confusion about nothing. I was talking
to my friend who helped us with the
Greenland story, lawyer and investigator
Martin Klest earlier this week and
Martin was at Copenhagen airport right
at the very moment that all of this was
going down and he said that the police
and military response was hysterical.
There was absolute outofcontrol concern.
This wasn't just a drone flap. There's a
lot more behind all of this. Uh he said
that um uh at one stage he was accosted
by a special forces policeman who
demanded to know what did you see? What
did you see? I'm going to be hopeully
hopefully talking to Martin later in the
week. But what's really interesting is
the correlation between the Copenhagen
incident and dare I say it the slightly
less frequent but still ongoing
incursions in continental United States.
Contrary to the disinformation that's
being put out by certain agencies, this
has not gone away. I am still in touch
with people including police and um uh
local uh government in New Jersey.
They're telling me they're still seeing
these objects. My friends John and Jerry
Tedesco are still seeing these anomalous
objects, including in the flight paths
on the approach to Kennedy Airport at
New York. This is serious and this is
why this matters. The whole issue of
UAPs, of unidentified objects making
incursions over secure airspace,
especially crowded passenger airports
like Copenhagen or JFK, New York. This
raises really grave flight safety
national security concerns and it's a
huge concern when governments start
defaulting to the explanation that it's
the dastardly Ruskies or as happened in
New Jersey, the dastardly Chinese. Where
is your bloody evidence? Why make these
allegations without any proof? The
simple fact is I am being told by
multiple sources we have no idea what
was responsible for the New Jersey
incursions and the the incursions that
are still ongoing across different parts
of the United States, including over
military bases. I've spoken to somebody
two days ago who's been sending me
videos from Florida near Eglund Air
Force Base. These incursions, whatever
they are, may not necessarily be drones.
There are people that have described to
me seeing orblike objects coming into
airspace and then in some way morphing
into shapes of aircraft. I have people
that have shown me images of what look
like the shapes of a 737 or a commercial
passenger jet moving at impossibly slow
speeds over parts of New Jersey and New
York. It's the same in Copenhagen.
Martin tells me that some of the
witnesses in Copenhagen estimated the
size of this object as the size of an
A380 aircraft, the largest commercial
passenger jet. Whatever these objects
are, I really think we're at the stage
where we need to stop swallowing and
just accepting glibbly the explanations
from government agencies who default
immediately to it must be the Ruskies,
it must be the Chinese. And then they
start saying, "Oh, it was
misidentifications. It was civilian
aircraft. You're a bunch of hystericss.
You got it all wrong." There is clearly
something invading the airspace of
certain nations around the world. It's
actually happening in Russia, China,
Japan. It's happening everywhere. It has
diminished a lot since the November,
December, January incidents over the
north of America, but it's still
happening. And the interesting thing is
nobody nobody has ever provided a shred
of proof to establish that Russia, China
or any foreign state adversary is
responsible for these incursions, which
if you think about it is insane.
If something the size of an A380 was
coming into the airspace of Copenhagen's
airport, you would know for a fact that
any kind of aircraft would be seen on
radar. Early detected, jets would be
scrambled. The source and the origin of
the um drone or object or whatever it is
would be traced. That hasn't happened.
Wake up people. Something is much much
more significant here than we're being
allowed to know. Why are governments
persistently trying to blame Russia and
China? I know it's an easy default
explanation, but if you remember, there
was that representative Jeff Van Drew in
Congress in North America who came out
and said that the drones over New Jersey
were an Iranian mother ship. That never
came to anything either. At what stage
do we start seriously questioning the
veracity of government statements when
they issue so many contradictory
assertions? Remember, we were told that
the drones over New Jersey were FAA
authorized research drones, which was a
total lie. The FAA came out and
categorically denied that they had
authorized any overflights in that area.
Then we were told it was
misidentifications of civilian aircraft
which is also contradicted by two
Pentagon generals from Northcom NORAD.
General Glenn Van Herk among them. I
mean these guys are really senior
generals and they are admitting what the
president has now admitted about
Copenhagen. We don't know. And why don't
governments just admit they don't know?
It's as simple as that. Rant over.
Okay, we will go to your next favorite
government entity, Arrow. They posted on
X this week, see official UAP imagery on
Arrow's website, including resolved and
unresolved reports as well as a trunch
of newly declassified videos from US
European Command. So, just for fun, I
did go and click on that link that they
posted and they have posted new videos.
These are from incidents from 2022. Um,
and then they the dates that they added
them in 2025, all in September. Um, and
they're saying resolved as a balloon, a
balloon, unresolved, um, not anomalous.
Balloon, balloon, balloon. Your reaction
to these new balloon resolved reports.
>> Look, I'm really sorry. I I just can't
take Arrow seriously anymore, and I
don't think anybody does. I think the
government's hope that they could
contain public interest in the UAP
phenomenon by creating an agency inside
the defense department that's accused of
covering up this issue is failing. Um,
sadly, even though I do know there are
good people in our among them, Dr. John
Kosowski, who's very well-intentioned.
The office uh of the under secretary of
defense intelligence is doing its level
best to have an unsavory influence on
the determinations that Arrow makes. And
frankly, it's the fox in charge of the
hen house. Arrow simply can't be trusted
because of who it's working for. And I
completely agree with Representative
Anna Paulina Luna and Representative
Eric Berles who have flagged very
strongly that we should have no longer
any faith at all in Arrow and that we
should no longer trust the Pentagon with
doing investigations into UAPs. The
investigation into unidentified
anomalous phenomena needs to be taken
away from the defense department and the
intelligence community. their malign,
often malevolent influence needs to be
removed and the agency needs to be
genuinely independent. And I suspect
that's going to happen. Keep a really
close eye on ongoing FBI investigations.
I'm told Cash Patel is ensuring that
there is a rigorous and thorough
investigation. And in my dealings with
the FBI, I've had a very good sense that
these people are genuine and
well-intentioned. I don't get the same
feeling about the people who are
controlling Arrow.
>> Okay, we will go to an email from Zayn.
Thank you for all the content and hard
work you two do on a daily basis. My
question is, if the US was to get into a
military conflict with Russia or China,
do you think we would see these exotic
or advanced crafts in battle? Is there
any external conflict conflict important
enough to win that we would see these be
used? Any insight you can provide would
be appreciated.
That's a very interesting question. I
mean, one of the explanations I've been
offered, I suspect some of it's
speculative from people purporting to
know what's going on inside the legacy
retrieval and reverse engineering
program. They offer the explanation that
one of the reasons for the secrecy is
that we want to ensure that we when I
say we I mean America the western
alliance the five eyes alliance has
dominance in terms of any potential
conflict with a foreign adversary.
The concern from the sources I've spoken
to in the program with direct knowledge
they assert of what the US has and what
the US has done with that technology is
that because of the excessive secrecy
surrounding the program we have been
overtaken by China in particular. But
the concern and as you would have heard
on reality check a few weeks ago, I've
talked about the Russians as well, the
Yemen mountain complex where there are a
lot of developments of super weapons
that are happening amongst the Russian
scientific community. The concern is
that Russia and China have been able to
develop an advance over what the US has
done with these technologies and we just
won't know. Frankly, I find it very sad
that if there is retrieved non-human
technology, it's potentially being held
back from the public and kept secret so
that we can win the next war with it.
What would that say to any potential
non-human intelligence that's having a
look at us from afar, wondering if we
are perhaps worthy of membership of some
greater community of non-human
intelligences? I I suspect they'd take a
pretty dim view. I mean, we have to
forget our warlike tech, warlike
tendencies and maybe find different ways
of resolving conflict. Uh, but yeah, I
mean, I do think that the United States
has developed weapons. I've talked
openly about scalar weapons and pulse
beam technology before, plasma beam
technology. I do believe that those
weapons are in development, and I
wouldn't be surprised at all if we were
holding them back in reserve for
potential conflicts. But I think what we
have to be very careful about is whether
the Russians and the Chinese have
developed something similar or better.
>> Okay. UAP Jedi on X. Hi Megan. In the
next Q&A, could you ask Ross about NASA
becoming a national intelligence and
security agency? And could it mean an
increase in its budget through
undisclosed black budget funding? Also,
what does it mean for any potential
disclosure of precursors of intelligent
life being found on exoplanets?
Look, I spoke to somebody uh in NASA
about this and they told me they thought
it had more to do with the Trump
administration's intention to impose
massive bud budget cuts on the space
agency and that they're trying to avoid
a fight with the labor unions by
categorizing NASA as an intelligence
agency, which means that the labor
unions can't have the influence and
power that they would if it was just a
normal civilian agency. I mean, let's be
realistic. NASA has operated for all of
its life as a quasi military
intelligence agency. Most of the
programs that are being launched by NASA
uh through mainly SpaceX because they
can't fly a rocket themselves most of
the time is um uh intelligence
classified material spy satellites and
things like that. So there's already
been a lot of intelligence work by NASA
and I'm always reminded of the fact that
my friend the spaceman who was a close
friend of uh astronaut Edgar Mitchell on
Apollo 14, Edgar Mitchell told him that
the Apollo astronauts were aware of
nonhuman intelligences following each
moon mission out from Earth, following
them and watching them while they were
on the moon and then following them back
to Earth. And when he was asked by the
spaceman why he'd never spoken publicly
about it, Edgar used the one word,
treason. And that's a story I tell in my
book. And it's interesting because it
shows just how much of a quasi military
agency NASA is. And people need to look,
I mean, honestly, the origins of NASA
are very much rooted in the um Nazi
spies, sorry, the Nazi Nazi military
that were brought out during Operation
Paperclip after the Second World War.
Much of NASA is rooted in intelligence
and defense. So, it's no huge surprise
to me. I suspect it's got a lot to do
with the decision to try and cut NASA
funding. Um, I do think uh NASA's
origins are very much rooted in the
defense and intelligence community. And
it doesn't surprise me at all that it's
being categorized as an intelligence
agency, but I think that's got a lot to
do with the Trump administration's
intentions to take on the labor unions
and impose massive budget cuts on the
space agency. And if they are imposing
budget cuts on the space agency, why
would a US government administration
decide that the space agency of the
United States was largely surplus to
requirements? Go figure. Interesting,
isn't it?
>> Absolutely. We have an email from Mark
that came in. In a video on YouTube, it
is claimed that the SkyWatcher program
actually got a UAP to land in the
presence of NASA. Have you heard
anything about this from any of your
sources? There didn't seem to be
anything about it on SkyWatcher website
last time I checked. This is something
you may want to ask the people at
SkyWatcher about and maybe even offer to
do an interview with them. Hopefully,
this would be something that they can
agree to and not be restricted by any
NDAs.
>> Oh, I couldn't agree more. Look, I I
have heard about an incident uh which I
have not been told about officially. Um,
I I'm aware that two uh psionic
operators went off on their own. They
weren't wearing cameras. They weren't
carrying any kind of video equipment.
And in the course of an encounter, a
summoning that they were trying to do
privately. An object, a craft did
apparently land in front of them. Um,
I'm assuming that this story is being
held back by Alex Clous and Skywatcher
for what I'm told we can expect to be
the next installment of their videos
that they're producing uh, which they
often put up online. They've put two two
or three previous videos up online and
um, this next one's meant to be on
psionics. Uh, so I've invited Alex Clous
Skywatcher multiple times. We have an
open invitation to Skywatcher to appear.
I do think in the interests of public
disclosure, it would be great to get
somebody from Skywatcher on at some
stage to talk about what they're up to
because it's one of the things we get
questions about more than most. People
are really interested and excited and
happy to see that there is an
organization that's properly funded
that's doing good work investigating
UAPs and they have including to me made
multiple promises about being
transparent and open and I am like
everyone else getting frustrated with
the degree of secrecy surrounding the
SkyWatcher operation. I can only assume
it's because they want to make their own
films and do their own media. And we
welcome that. But it would be great at
some stage to get Alex Clos, Jake,
anybody else from Skywatcher who's
interested in coming on and talking to
actually talk about what they've been
doing, especially with the psionics. And
yes, we've heard about this incident
involving an alleged landing. Carl
Crusher mentioned it to me when we were
doing the work with Magic Mike Batista a
few weeks ago. and uh we really haven't
heard any more. Love to hear more.
>> Okay, Ruby on X, they posted a flyer um
and tagged us in it. Rumors and public
advertisements are stating that a
paranormal fair being held in France
will be revealing one of the alien
Roswell bodies in a glass case under
high surveillance. They're asking us,
are the French about to unveil one of
these bodies, or is this all rubbish?
I think we can safely say pretty damn
quickly this is a steaming pile of I
don't know what the word is for BS in
French but uh uh I I I think we should
be skeptical. Um uh I have not heard of
any claim at all that a Roswell body has
been released to anyone in France least
of all to a paranormal fear. Uh, I can
imagine that the biologics, as David
Grush referred to them from Roswell, are
locked up pretty damn tightly in a vault
somewhere, and I'm told it's somewhere
in Virginia. Um, uh, I don't think, uh,
we're going to see them anytime soon.
>> Okay. So, we will all cancel our airline
tickets to France. Perfect. All right.
We will go to Dave on X. Hi, Ross and
Megan. What is your opinion on the
latest news that has come out recently,
mainly via Dr. Steven Greer about the
bug sphere with carbon 14 testing
purportedly showing that resin connected
to the material is 12,500 years old.
>> Okay, the bugosphere again another
subject that we get a lot of queries
about. Yes, I have taken a very very
close interest in the work of a friend
of mine, Patrick Jackson, who we will
hopefully be bringing on the program
sometime soon. uh who's talked about
what he thinks is a sphere network that
operates around this planet. Um the
Booga sphere is a metallic orb that was
reportedly filmed hovering and
maneuvering over a place called Booger
in Colombia in early March this year.
The witnesses described it as a shiny
engraved sphere about the size of a
bowling ball. It weighed initially about
four or five pounds, but allegedly the
weight has somehow miraculously been
able to vary at times. Um there's
anomalous weight fluctuations is the
term, including um uh allegedly up to 8
kg in changes without visible mass
alteration. There are glyphs, internal
layered structures visible via X-ray,
claims of emitted low frequency signals,
claims that it's been responding to
stimuli like Sanskrit chants. It was
recovered by locals and it's been
analyzed by the prominent uh and
controversial Mexican eupfologist Yami
Masan and Dr. Steven Greer who have
promoted it as potential nonhuman
technology.
Now there are some interesting aspects
of this object. The videos and scans do
appear to show fiber optic like threads
and resin dots inside which has fueled
speculation of some kind of ancient
perhaps non-human origin.
Is it a hoax? Look, we just don't know.
And frankly, I don't think we can say
it's either a hoax or authentic right
now without rigorous completely
independent testing. Um, yes, the X-ray
scans do reveal complex internal
geometry, three layered spheres, fiber
optic alleged threads. Um, there's
alleged anomalies with the weight,
electromagnetic emissions.
Um
there's the glyphs apparently have been
analyzed by AI and they're supposedly
showing patterns linked to mech symbols.
Um there is a criticism which is that
the promoters that it is an authentic
object are at the moment not handing it
over to an independent laboratory. And
frankly who can blame them when we know
what happened to previous spheres in the
in the 1970s. There was a family in
Florida that found one of these metallic
spheres. They handed it over to the US
Air Force and it came back inert. it had
changed from what they personally
witnessed and filmed. So, what are the
arguments for a potential hoax? We have
to be upfront and say that Hami Masan,
albeit an extremely well-intentioned and
I think very decent man, he's been
accused of
mistaken beliefs before. Uh there was
the um alien mummies incident involving
Steven Greer, the Atakama object which I
think um professor uh Gary Nolan
definitively proved to be of human
origin even though there are many in
UAPology who take issue with that. Um
the uh
the glyphs, well I mean anybody could
get a metal ball and engrave it on a
metal ball and make it look mysterious.
Um
there's no independent verification. I
mean it would be great to you know to
see something other than unacredited
labs making these claims. My my issue
with the um the documents that they've
cited from these labs is that they've
got typos. There's been
misidentifications.
It's It's really weird. Um, so you need
third party lab access. Uh, what else
did I think? Oh, yeah. These resin
specs. I mean, it's impossible to know.
I mean, are they contaminations? We just
don't know. I don't know enough about
how the resin was obtained, whether
there's a possibility of
crosscontamination.
Did the resin get stuck to the object
when it landed on the ground? I know a
lot of people will say that what it does
the resin is it shows that the object
this is the whole point is that it has a
calibrated age of 10,510
years before Christian era um which is
12,560
years ago. Um
I know Metabunks had a go at it as well.
Stephen sorry what's his name? The
seagull guy. Mick West. Um,
bottom line is I just don't know. I
mean, I I'd just like to see it
rigorously independently tested. There
have been claims before like this which
have been disproven. Um, I think we
should enter into it extremely
skeptically. Uh, but yeah, I'd like to
go and have a look at it. And uh, Yummy
Man has invited me to come to Mexico and
when we have News Nation's bloated
travel budget, we will zoom down there
on our private jet and we'll go and have
a look.
Absolutely, Ross. I'm going to give you
one more for today. This is from George.
Has Ross ever read the law of one, also
known as the RA contact material? I
asked this because the entity known as
RA makes very specific claims that Ross
may be able to verify. For example, RA
states that US had ARVs in the 80s.
>> Okay. The law of one rah. This is a um a
very extensive series of alleged chneled
messages. Um I've I've looked at this
106 conversations called sessions
between I think he was a physicist
called Don Elkins. Uh he was a professor
of physics and a UFO investigator.
And he said that he was talking to
somebody called RA. They were a supposed
sixth density social memory complex that
formed on Venus about 2.6 billion years
ago. Humble messages of the law of one.
And that they'd previously tried to
spread this message in Egypt with mixed
results. So, we're meant to assume that
the references to the sun god Rah in
Egypt are in some way connected to the
law of Rah.
Um, frankly, what are we meant to make
of this? I I would like to see I know
that the uh the correspondent suggests
that there's been previous predictions
that the US has got alien reproduction
vehicles.
It would be great in any of those
channeling sessions if there was just
one specific detail that gave us enough
detail to be able to say definitively,
"Wow." That is a piece of corroborative
evidence that allows us to say
definitively, "Wow, this person that
spoke to this professor did say
something all those years ago which can
now be definitively corroborated." But
in my limited reading of the law of one,
I haven't seen anything that is with
sufficient specificity to say, "Well,
yeah, that's really so specific. It
rocks my boat." It it's not unusual that
somebody might channel the idea to
somebody in North America in the last
few decades and suggest that um the
United States has been able to reproduce
non-human technology. that's been the
subject of speculation for many many
decades. Um I I also think we should be
skeptical of anybody that purports to be
able to channel something unless there's
independent corroboration. Um skepticism
frankly is always the best option.
skepticism is good and I I just don't
think at the moment there's enough to be
able to say definitively yes there is
something to the law of one or indeed
anything to any of these claims that are
made about channeling. I get so many
people sending me claims that they've
had chneled messages from non-human
intelligences and they all contradict
each other. So they can't all be right
but is any one of them right? That's the
issue.
>> All right, thank you so much. That is
all for today. I'm not letting you go so
quickly, Megan. So many of our viewers
have asked me to ask you where you stand
on UAPs.
>> It's time, Megan. We're not going to let
you,
>> Ross. I think it would be extremely
narcissistic and self-centered to think
that we were the only life form on
Earth. And honestly, when I think about
space and the universe, I like kind of
get a little jumpy and anxiety. I
actually just finished a book last night
um on NASA in the 80s and the Milky Way
and all the galaxies. Um so to think
that there's nothing else out there is a
little lonely and a little scary. So of
course I think there's something else
going on. Um and I love being able to do
this journey with you on investigating
that.
Well, our audience love you back. So,
thank you so much for giving us that
opinion. And by the way, actually, I
should mention, I've got to watch it
yet, but my friend Jesse Michaels has
apparently done a very interesting show
on NASA just recently, which gets into
the early origins of some of the really
weird people behind NASA, like Jack
Parsons, who was into Satanism and all
manner of weird rituals. Um, I'm looking
forward to that. Yeah. you know, dark
black NASA. I I'm really interested in
hearing more about it. Um, thank you
very very much, Megan. If you do have
any questions for us, you can send
emails to reality checksow.com.
