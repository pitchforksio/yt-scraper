Hello and welcome back to Reality Check.
Well, for some time I've been hearing
stories about how our intelligence
community remains, despite its protests,
very interested in the subject of
psionics, psychics, and the phenomena
that I think a lot of debunkers dismiss
peoratively as a load of pilent
nonsense. Well, today I'm very honored
to be able to welcome to Reality Check,
a woman who is an extraordinarily
accomplished woman, Sarah Gam, worked on
the UAP task force officially for about
a year with the Pentagon in the
Department of Defense and then
unofficially for a lot longer before
Arrow took over. And I've seen her
speaking elsewhere and I think her story
is fascinating. I really admire her
willingness to engage candidly about the
fact that she believes she has certain
gifts, psychic abilities, mediumship
abilities, and yet at the same time
she's an accomplished scientist, trained
scientist and intelligence analyst
working in different times at very high
levels of the US intelligence community.
So, we're talking again this week
through our sponsor about the horrors of
what happens to your body when you eat
the ultrarocessed food that passes for
grub in America. And it turns out the
key to losing weight and keeping it off
is not in carbs or fat or even in
probiotic rich foods. know the endg game
of having a healthy weight as much as
well as more energy and a long healthy
life comes down to a specific switch you
can flip in your body to flush out
unnecessary calories. Dr. Seven Gundry
is calling this caloric bypass. And by
activating this specific process in your
body, he has seen thousands, yes,
thousands of people dramatically improve
their health even at age 50 and beyond.
This includes losing weight, getting
tons more energy, and returning to the
good health they had in their youth once
they simply addressed this one key to
better health. And not only is this
associated with improved digestion,
strong feeling joints and muscles,
smoother skin, and healthier lives, it
could also be the key to a healthier
life. Dr. Steven Gundry's lost 70 pounds
himself using his research and has kept
the weight off for over 20 years and
counting. His digestive issues are gone,
his health is fantastic, and he feels
younger and healthier today than he did
in his 40s. His video has been watched
by over 20 million people to date and
you can watch and learn more about it
atthehealthyfat.com/ros.
I'll say that again.
Thehealthyfat.com/ros.
It's linked at the bottom of this video,
but he'll teach you exactly how he's
kept his weight off for free at
thehealthyfat.com/ros.
and you can click in the description
below.
It's a privilege to have her wi with us
here today. And Sarah, I'd like to
welcome you to Reality Check.
>> Hi, thank you. Thanks so much for having
me and I appreciate that intro.
>> So tell me this, Sarah, you worked on
the UAP task force. What years were you
there?
I started officially in 2019 through uh
I forget somewhere later in 2020
whenever I left NGA and National
Geospatial Intelligence Agency and went
to ODNI office of director Natural
Intelligence. Um so that was my official
stint on it and then the unofficial
stent was uh I kept on supporting
supporting from from behind the door a
little bit. Now, you'll know that I
interviewed Dave Grush, of course, last
year, and of course, he came from the
NGIA, the National Geospatial
Intelligence Agency. I don't suppose you
guys shared a desk or were in the same
coffee room by any chance, were you? Did
you know him there?
>> No, we weren't even in the same time
zone. I know he also supported from NRO
perspective, and some of the NRO
colleagues knew him, but um we were not
in the same time zone, so we never got
to to share coffee or meet. So, you'd
never even heard about each other. And
even though you were working on the
UAPTF at the time?
>> Um, I I did not I did not know him.
Well, I was supporting the task force
from a very small niche, from a small
corner from NGA. So we kind of were kept
in our own bucket and didn't really
participate in um he sounded sounds like
he participated in a lot broader
perspective and I was very um yeah very
fine-tuned perspective from imagery
aspect.
>> Now I'm sure you're tied up like most
people with ridiculously long top secret
SCI compartmented clearances that
restrict you from talking about much
relating to your job and we will respect
that. We're not inviting you to discuss
things that are national security
sensitive, but can you give us an idea
what did the UAPF do? Like what was the
role of the UAPTF? Cuz I think for a lot
of us it comes as a huge surprise to
know that even while the the um public
debate was going on about whether or not
UAPs were being taken seriously. All
this time there was a unit inside the
Pentagon even before Arrow the all
domain anomaly resolution office that
was indeed investigating UFOs UAPs.
>> Yeah. What I my perspective of the task
force was either trying to prove
something was unidentified and
unidentified aerial phenomenon or
anomalous phenomenon whichever term you
want to use. um that didn't mean it was
non-human intelligence. It just meant we
couldn't identify it. So that's what our
definition was. And so we proved or
disproved it was a very collaborative
effort. It was pretty amazing for how
many uh different agencies and people um
at least from NGA perspective, no one
was really turned away who wanted to
support it. It was really diverse and um
kind of like kind uh what yeah open open
arms type thing of collaboration. So uh
yeah we we all work together to try to
prove or disprove data that came in.
>> Let's skirt around your TSSCI clearances
and see how close we can get to get you
to pry out some dark secrets. So
>> definitely no promises. I don't want to
go to jail tonight or any time in the
near future.
>> Did you see videos that the public
hasn't seen yet that made you realize
just how real the phenomenon is?
>> Oh, absolutely. Um, this question is
actually getting easier and easier to
answer. The first time I answered it, it
I paused quite a long time. Um, and now
it's it's getting easier because I know
the stigma and people want to hear this
and these words help. So yes, definitely
there's a lot more out there and some of
it, you know, unfortunately classified
that can't be released to the public.
Um, but no doubt in my mind that we're
not alone.
>> So when you say we're not alone, you
believe that we are Earth is being
visited or at least there are non-human
intelligences engaging with this planet.
>> Yes, absolutely.
>> Wow.
>> That is what I'm saying.
>> Can you tell us what the smoking gun
was? What was the aha moment for you
when you realized having access and
being privy to this information within
the constraints of what you're allowed
to tell us? What was that moment like?
What what happened? What did you see?
You know, how did it move you?
>> Yeah, I think it was a buildup of
multiple things. Uh so one of the first
videos where a handful of us really
didn't know what it was and we were
talking to other intelligence community
agencies and you know people with the
clearance rate. Um it was at first like
I don't know my science brain is very
active and skeptic. Uh my also but my
science brain knows we're not alone
because I you know I'm an astrophysicist
as well. So, how could we be the only
people an infinite amount of space? It
just makes no sense. So, I was
definitely a skeptic. The first couple
of things that I saw thing like
discounted it as um you know that was
just a couple of pixels. it was blurry.
And then slowly over time, more and more
things accumulated. And then there was
um just a couple of incidences where
some videos were a little bit clearer or
some some images were a little bit
clearer than others. And it's just
your breath kind of stopped like that.
That's there's no way that could have
been a balloon or parallax because
parallax is of course very prevalent in
a lot of the cases.
Yeah.
>> So tell me this. One of the excuses or
reasons that's often given for why this
kind of uh video data cannot be released
is because to reveal it would reveal
sources and methods. Now is that a
legitimate reason for excluding all of
the imagery you saw? Right. I can
imagine there might be some satellites,
for example, and we don't want the
potential adversaries to know just how
clever we are with those satellites. I
talked to people here in Australia who
shock me with how clear the satellite
imagery is that comes down through Pine
Gap all the way back to the US. But um
do you think that it's legitimate that
all of the imagery has been withheld or
do you think that there is a public
interest in seeing perhaps at least some
if not all of that imagery?
>> Yeah, very good question. I will say
I don't want to give a percentage but
I'll say a good portion of what I saw I
don't think should be released because
it is protecting sensitive and maybe you
know people on the ground and um but
yeah I don't see why some of you know
what we were able to observe even the
ones that were proven to be balloons or
something to give examples of what we've
been looking at that this is science.
We're not just saying every video that
comes across our path, including just
stuff that's posted on YouTube, right?
So, we're looking at all the data, not
just classified. And to give examples of
parallax or um yeah, balloons or bird
migration, bird m I've I've learned
about birds during this time. um uh or
you know fishing boat formations and all
kinds of stuff that um you you might not
really think but you end up learning
you learn so much more than than what
you think just going down these rabbit
holes. Um
yeah, so I I could see uh some of them
definitely being declassified. I am by
far in no position to be an authority or
anything like that. So, I'm just going
to stay hopeful that one day maybe me my
words speaking right now might help uh
nudge somebody to be able to disclose
some stuff.
>> What do you think, And I'm not trying to
get you into trouble, so you are welcome
to deflect this question if you want to.
>> I appreciate that.
>> But what what do you think of the
explanation that has been offered by the
Pentagon in recent times that there is
no evidence at all of extraterrestrial
visitation to this planet?
Um, I don't know what they looked at to
say that. I don't understand why they
would. Um, when there's a lot of us
saying that we've seen otherwise. And
yeah, it kind of hurts because a lot of
us worked really hard on some data and
debunking or proving or, you know,
whatever. It was it was a lot of hard
work that went into some of the videos
that I saw. And for them to come out
saying that right now, it's it's it's a
it hits you a little hard.
>> One of the things you've used a couple
of times is the term parallax. Now, I I
know what parallax is, and I'll try and
explain it, but if you could correct me,
I'm sure I'm going to screw it up. As I
understand it, parallax is describing
the phenomenon where an object looks
further away from the camera than it
really is. And as a result of that, it's
basically moving far faster to the
viewer looking at the image than it
really is. And so that you get this
false image of an object moving super
super fast when in fact it's actually
moving quite slowly because it's closer
to the camera than we realize. Is that a
fair description?
>> Yeah, that's that's great. Yeah, I would
um the only thing I would add on from
just trying to give a I'm I'm a visual
person. So if you're looking out like if
you're a pilot in an airplane looking
out over the horizon, it's really hard
to judge distance. Um so if you're
looking at a drone video and something's
flying by, um maybe the drone video also
is panning across the scene. Um so that
will make the object look faster as well
or maybe it might look stagnant. Um so
it's diff difficult to get direction and
velocity um due to parallax but yeah you
did a great job.
>> So Chris Melon who's a former very very
senior defense official has candidly
spoken about his frustration that the
Pentagon's not being open about even
what it's seeing in outer space. Now,
are you able to tell me, did any of the
imagery that you see, you saw in your
time come from space-based
satellites or objects?
>> Yes. Yeah, there were some that were
Yeah. from space-based satellites
looking down.
>> And were they clearer? Well, I mean, I'm
told that a lot of the more clear
imagery and high resolution imagery has
been shot from um satellites andor the
space station andor the space shuttle in
its time.
>> Um I've Yes, I've seen some.
>> Yeah. And similarly, one of the things
that has been pointed to me is I'm told
that one of the videos that really set
off people at the UAP task force was an
object that appeared to be operating
trans medium moving in and out of the
water. Um, is that are you able to speak
with any reference to that? Was there an
object that you saw on video that was
alarmingly clear coming in and out of
water?
I have seen data that shows that. I
can't get into much detail about it. Um
but
uh you know some of the legacy videos
that have that you know the public sees
you know I never spent time really
diving into them because people already
did that. Taxpayer dollars have already
gone into that. So I have seen other
videos that are of what you just
described. So Lou Alzando uh has at
different times acknowledged that he has
seen videos in the public domain that
are still the subject of speculation as
to whether or not they're authentic
which are he believes genuine videos cuz
he saw them during his time when he was
operating in a classified role. Have you
had that experience yourself? Are there
videos that you've seen that you believe
are genuine that are still being debated
in the public arena?
Um, yeah, I actually appreciate that
question a lot. There are some things
that have been leaked and I want to say
what has been unfortunately leaked which
is what we call an unauthorized
disclosure uh isn't the whole picture.
So some things that have been in media
um is it 5% of what it is and I can't
talk about more of what it truly was.
But I will say I hope people stop
leaking because that's not helping us
because it's not the actual story.
>> Actually this is really interesting
because I I mean I I respect and
actually admire why you're saying that
and I think I understand why. I'm privy
to some information. You know, there is
a risk, isn't there? And I don't think
people understand this enough that we
might compromise
uh technologies, capabilities that
aren't otherwise known about by
potential adversaries. Is that fair to
say?
>> Oh, absolutely. And it's not this just
that it's we've looked at some of these
things already and
have you know different opinions than
what was provided to the media um from
the person who leaked the data. So
that's why I'm saying
other than it being an an entire like
unauthorized disclosure and an issue
from that perspective it is not the
whole story and it's not always
accurate. Um, so it's actually hurting
us uh versus helping us.
>> Yeah. So, let's talk about you, Sarah. I
mean, I'm fascinated and I admire your
courage and being prepared to talk about
it because you actually coped a serve
from uh a certain person who shall be
unnamed after you came public and talked
about your mediumship role, the fact
that you have alleged psychic abilities
and that you use those psych psychic
abilities as a separate day job, a
separate job from your day job. What um
what can you tell me about how how early
you realized you had those alleged
gifts?
>> Um childhood I started I had encounters
with a loved one that had passed over uh
that crossed over. Geez. And uh probably
middle school I started having
encounters with spirit. And I didn't
start having more psychic abilities
until after I had a near-death
experience in 2012. And after that more
things started happening. Um but yeah so
kind of for a while but I didn't really
start learning how yeah I don't even
know how to approach it. Learning this
journey taking classes and training um
until about probably six years ago five
or six years ago I forget now.
>> Now that's fascinating to me because
I've spoken to a lot of people who are
combat veterans. people who've been in
very near-death experiences when there
are people shooting at them, trying to
kill them, and they describe how um
often they have an encounter or an
engagement with the phenomenon for the
very first time that literally scares
the pajabas out of them. It's often not
friendly. In your case, it seems to have
been quite friendly, hasn't it? Can you
tell me what happened? I mean, I I don't
want to distress you because I know it
was a horrific period in your life, but
how was it that you came a beautiful
young woman like yourself, how was it
that you came close to death for
heaven's sake? What happened?
>> Uh, I had a routine sinus surgery. I had
a bad deviated septum and was getting a
septtolasty done and surgery went well.
Uh, recovery room did not. I first
initially woke up and asked to go back
to sleep. And uh when I went back to
sleep, I didn't wake up again. I heard
the nurse say, "Oh my god, she's not
breathing." And I was like, "Who's not
breathing? That sucks. I pray that
they're okay." And it was me. And next
thing I know, I'm I'm not on Earth
anymore. And um with my family and loved
ones and uh yeah, it was very
unexpected. And um I don't even know how
soon after that was when I started
having psychic things. Probably within a
couple years.
>> So I can't let this go by. You've
actually died.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> What's it like?
>> I'm alive because of of an epinephrine
shot actually and um because God kicked
me out of heaven. So
um what's it like? It is the most uh if
you can imagine
love and peace and those things
completely surrounding you in a cloud or
in a bubble and it's that feeling that
you're picturing right now except
exponentially more. Um it's incredible
and having my family there and trying
not to tear up. Um it's the best feeling
ever. I was home and and my family was
there to greet me and then I heard a
voice say, "You got to go back." And I
was like, "Go back where? This is great.
I'm good. That place sucked." And I lost
that argument. My family teamed up with
the voice with God, source, whoever you
want to say it is. And uh my family
teamed up and I lost that argument. They
came back.
And so you're saying that as a result of
that experience, something seems to have
enhanced abilities that I think you
believe you already had.
>> Yeah, absolutely. I It seems like I
don't know if something maybe got turned
on or what, but stuff and it felt like
it was always there, but I just it was a
little boost, a battery pack boost and
uh and it started happening.
So, a lot of the people I've spoken to
who are combat veterans, people who've
been involved in killing themselves and
and and basically people trying to kill
them, they often have really frightening
experiences. You know, they've had the
kind of hitchhiker phenomenon where
apparently malevolent anomalous
phenomena appears to be engaging with
them. That's quite threatening. Is that
what happened to you?
I didn't have any. Well, um I don't
know. I don't know how far you want to
get on down this rabbit hole, but I've
definitely had a long way. I'm very
interested.
>> All right, everybody buckle up. Um I
have definitely had some malevolent uh
things happen to me for sure. I have uh
encountered
so many different things from I call it
earthbound spirits uh which are ghosts
like so if you know you see ghost
hunting shows it's typically earthbound
spirits that that they're they haven't
crossed over to the other side um even
different alien races during some of my
sessions um house clearings or uh house
clearing is when a medium a raiki master
could even go in it doesn't have to be a
medium them. Um, but you kind of clear
out somebody's house for them if they
feel like there's a spirit there or
maybe some really bad energy. So, you go
in and kind of clear it out and then
bless it afterwards. Um, so I've I've
encountered some malevolent things
during pretty much all of the types of
spiritual work that I do. Um, but I've
encountered a lot of good and a lot of
love. So, I don't want to digate and and
say everything's bad, but um
uh yeah, I don't know want to get into
specifics, but there's also something
that's called residual energy. So,
that's kind of like an imprint. So, um
think of uh physics, you know,
everything is energy. Everything is, you
know, uh you you can't what is the first
law of thermodynamics? You you can't uh
create or destroy energy and or a part
of the first law. Um, so everything's
energy even the other side. So, uh, a
ghost or a soul that was here that was
alive, when it goes the other side, it's
in another dimension where there's still
energy. There's still electromagnetic
field. And, uh, so that if there's a
traumatic
experience that happened in a place, a
war or, you know, maybe a murder or a
flood and, you know, flash flood comes
through. So there's trauma. There's an
imprint that happened in the energy
field. And uh this residual energy is
like a a replay. It's a movie reel, like
a just, you know, short reel that's on a
loop. And so sometimes the energy
doesn't know that you're there. But when
like a person sensitive to it, when I
walk through it, I'll absorb something.
And so I' I've I've absorbed some very
negative things as well before. So, when
you were a child, before you had this
near-death experience, had you
experienced any kind of anomalous
phenomena?
>> Um, when I was a kid, I thought I did,
but now I know I was likely watching
satellites fly over. Um, I never saw
anything looking up in the sky cuz I I
first fell in love with the stars when I
was in third grade. One of my brothers
got a satellite for Christmas and we
took it out and we looked at the moon. I
annoyed everybody with a million
questions that no one had answers to and
that was it was love at first sight. Um,
so I've been looking up for a very long
time and I grew up in rural Missouri on
a farm so we had clear skies all all the
nights that I wanted that didn't have
clouds and I never saw any object in the
sky until last year. So, I was in North
Carolina with my family and some friends
and some strangers uh at uh Brown
Mountain in Lindville Gorge in North
Carolina.
>> And Brown just for the sake of our
viewers who may not know Brown Mountain,
it's quite a famous location for looking
at anomalous lights, isn't it?
>> Mhm.
>> Yes. Brown Mountain Light. So, that was
the whole purpose. We were going UFO
hunting and of the group of us, I think
there was maybe 10 or 8 to 10 of us, I
forget. And then there are some other no
strangers on the overlook. So it was not
a hike or anything. So there's uh you
know concrete path and stuff like that.
So it's um not you're not out completely
in the wilderness. But it's a beautiful
beautiful view if anybody ever gets a
chance to go there. And one of the guys
and I that I had just met, we were
talking with a woman and we were facing
like I'm facing you right now. And so we
were looking up and the light appeared
and I kind kind of took my breath away
and I was like that's an airplane.
That's for sure an airplane. It
discounted it and it went away and then
it came back and it was just a little
bit higher than where it was before and
it kind of did a little bit of movement
and just disappeared. And it happened so
quickly I couldn't even get my phone
out. Like, so I totally understand when
people are like, I didn't get a video
because the video probably wouldn't have
showed up anyway because it was, you
know, midnight or something. Um, yeah,
it was pretty crazy. And I was looked at
the dude and I'm like, did did you just
And he was and he had this beautiful
soft voice and he was like, yeah, I
don't want to ruin your experience. And
I'm like, but you could ruin it. Was was
that what we saw? Like, go ahead and
ruin it. I want to know. And so you're
convinced it was something really
anomalous?
>> Oh, absolutely. Yeah, it was really
cool. And no one else saw it because all
the other group, they were in a
different spot and they were looking a
different direction. So, we were we were
the only two that saw it.
>> Now, do you want to talk about the more
recent anomalous objects that you've
seen? I think in even in the privacy of
your own home.
>> Yeah. Um
I haven't told a ton of people this. Um,
I had this was actually probably
um I would say trying to think of what
time frame it was. I know it was at
least last summer or maybe before that I
woke I so I do have vivid dreams and
lucid dreams. And so sometimes I'm I
know dreams are happening and I'll let
them play out or I'll control them or
something like that. And so at one
point, I don't know what time of the
night it was because I never bothered to
look at the clock. Um, but something
woke me up because it was pacing in my
bedroom. And as a medium, that happens.
That is that is that is not um I'm going
to call it a rare occurrence now because
I know how to protect myself and I know
how to protect my house. Um, but it
happens. And so I immediately thought,
"Oh, this is a spirit." Because
sometimes I'll I'll see these things in
between like when you're starting to
wake up and coming out of I'll see them
then. So when I actually open my eyes
they won't be there and then I kick them
out of my house. Um so this instance I
actually sat up in bed and it was still
there and I'm like I'm still sleeping
and it was pacing in my house and
>> what did you see? Tell me what you saw.
Um,
it was it looked like it was probably
six and a half maybe to seven feet tall
>> and it was dark. Uh, so it was hard to
depict exactly what color it was, but it
was looked like it was like a bluish
purple skin. There were there was no
hair on top of its head and it had some
ridges on its side. There were no ears.
Uh, so it was really flat and the nose
kind of looked like a little bit more
like Voldemort, but a maybe a little bit
more bump than Voldemort. And it had
like a I'll call it like a Star Trek
type uniform on. Um, very like straight,
plain, very clean. I couldn't tell what
color it was cuz it it was dark. Um, but
so it was a darker color and it had this
sword. It looked like it was made of
very um beautiful crystals. Um like not
crystals, it wasn't plural. It was like
one object. Uh it looked like some from
from a sci-fi movie. Um but it was like
glowing and it was like kind of
changing. Um
>> sorry, where was this? Sorry, I didn't
pick up where that was. What was this
crystal?
>> Yeah, it was in um in my bedroom. So the
he was holding it. He was holding it.
>> So he was holding what? A a rod or
>> he was holding a sword at the side. So
what do I have around here? Here's my
phone. So he was holding like if this is
the the the handle, he was holding it
downward like not in a threatening like
not attacking in a threatening manner.
Um and he was pacing um not quite at the
foot of my bed but a little bit past it.
And so I still was like my is this real?
Like this is totally real. And so I
start and I looked down and Krypton my
cat he is my little protector. and um he
was just sitting there watching it. So
I've seen Krypton
um fight malevolent things for me um
spiritual wise and I have seen him growl
and fight in the air and he's also seen
I have a best friend that passed away
and so he visits and so Krypton like
I've seen him react to good and bad
energy and he was just sitting there
watching it just like I was and so I was
like okay yeah I'm not getting bad
feeling any either. So, I started asking
her questions. I'm like, "Can I help
you? Do you need some water? Do you do
you need a pillow? Do you do you do you
need a blanket? Like, are you cold? I
could turn up the air. I got to walk by
you, though, to get to the thermostat."
So, I'm asking all of these ridiculous
questions just to try to get it to
engage with me. And it it was like a
guard at the London Palace was like face
forward on a mission, and I just kept
feeling like it was protecting me. Um,
at one point there was kind of a glow
and it looked like a portal. Um, it was
like a like a very very light pinkish
glow that appeared and he stopped or it
stopped. I shouldn't say he. It stopped.
Looked in the in the like the portal
thing and it lasted for not even two
seconds and and it went away and he kept
on pacing. I got goosebumps.
Um, and I was like, "Okay, so now do you
need water? Is like should I be
worried?" And again, didn't do anything.
Just kept on pacing. And I'm like, and
so Krypton at that point laid down to go
back to sleep. Okay. If you're if you're
okay with this, I'm going to be okay
with this. And so I went back to sleep.
>> You're kidding. So come on, Sarah. I
mean, I've got to say, if I if I had a
blue alien humanoid in my bedroom, I'd
be yelling at it saying, "Get the hell
out of here." I mean, um, I mean, I'd be
terrif of a medium, though. Like, some
of these things aren't that, you know, I
there's things that happen as a medium
that you're, you know, a door might slam
and you're like, "Okay, who wants my
attention and not right now?"
>> So, what do you think was the purpose if
if this actually happened? What do you
think was the purpose of that visit? I'm
intrigued also that the being
>> was blue.
>> I I think it was protecting me. I was
uh I had I had already been I'm going to
be in James Fox's film that is coming
out hopefully soon and I had already
been filmed and was dealing with uh some
I don't know some confusing stuff at
work relating to career choices and
leaving the UAP field. And so I think it
was it was just to show me that I'm
protected from the other side. That no
matter what choice I make, they're there
for me. Uh I have encountered uh
different alien races in some
meditations and in some of my healing
work. So to me, it was just another
layer of I I got support.
So obviously a lot I suspect most of our
viewers are sitting watching this going,
"Oh my god, this is a member of the UAP
task force who's actually talked to an
alien, somebody who has engaged with a
nonhuman being and believes passionately
that they exist. In fact, you're more
than belief. You, I suspect, would say
you know they're real because you've
seen it directly yourself."
>> Yeah, absolutely. So just explain to me,
I mean, you're a scientist. You're an
astrophysicist by training. You're a
trained intelligence analyst. You're not
an idiot. You're trusted with top secret
SCI compartmentalized material. Your
government values you. Were they ever at
all when you when they became aware of
your um mediumship role, your psychic
abilities, were they ever at all
discouraging you? Was there any effort
to try and discourage you from being
open? H how does it feel in your office
environment to speak candidly about the
fact that you believe that you have
these gifts?
>> What's amazing to say is no one cares. I
was terrified
petrified to let people know what I'm
trying to have a business. I don't know
what I'm doing and I have no idea what
I'm doing with a website either. So when
I first created my LLC,
my name was out there. And so I
eventually called it I I I outed myself
on Facebook and to all my friends, most
of my friends I've known my whole life.
It was no surprise to anybody.
Everything made sense. But work doesn't
care. Um, my friends that I had on
Facebook at the time that I that were
co-workers, they were like they would
come to work like, "Oh my gosh, you
could do this. You have to tell me
stories." And like everybody was
actually really excited and and asked me
questions and it's never come up of
don't do this or like you can't have
this sap read on anymore. It's never it
it I was terrified and it's just it I'm
so proud to say that it doesn't matter.
One of the things that always intrigued
me and I I remember reading slide nine
at the very beginning of my research
when I was first looking at the UAP
issue and I became aware of this
document that had been prepared by
people inside the Pentagon who were
briefing I think Thomas Modley who was
at the time an under secretary for
defense on the phenomenon and they were
talking about how the phenomenon has the
capability to psychically ly engage with
human beings. And it struck me that one
of the most recurring messages that I
get from the many many people that I
speak to as I investigate and research
this phenomenon is that there is an
intrinsic connection between the
phenomenon what you and I might call
flying sauces, flying discs, orbs,
anomalous phenomena, and human
consciousness and possibly human psychic
abilities. Do you agree?
>> Oh, absolutely. Nope. Most of my
communication that I have with spirit,
when I say spirit, it's with that that
that is a bucket of all the things of
the other side. Um when I communicate
with them, it's usually telepathically
or is through images. Um, so, uh, let's
say a loved one is trying to talk like a
I'm sitting with a client right now and
I'll get an image of a sunflower. So,
it's like puzzle pieces. So, everything
does come in telepathically. So, when
I've heard stories of NHI and maybe even
people speaking through the aircraft,
like they're looking observing at the
aircraft and they get messages there. It
totally didn't surprise me. and um in
dimensions that they operate in. You
know, they understand physics and
science way more than we do. Earth is
pretty young compared to the age of the
universe. So, uh they're way more
advanced, so it makes sense that they
understand different levels, different
dimensions, and can talk in different
ways with us.
>> So, Sarah, explain this to me. The thing
I wrestle with as a journalist, I'm an
open person, a transparent person. I
don't understand why if there is a
nonhuman intelligence, why doesn't it
land on the White House lawn? Why
doesn't it show itself more overtly to
us?
>> Wasn't there wasn't there an occurrence
decades ago at the White House?
Um
>> I don't know. I think they know that
maybe we're not ready. We'll pro, you
know, we have too many movies saying if
they do that, we're going to go to war
and and you know,
I don't know. Um,
>> do you have any evidence from your time
in the Pentagon that there might be some
kind of non-intervention order, a prime
directive, as Star Trek referred to it?
>> Um,
I don't think so.
Um, I mean I am at the Pentagon now,
but not for not for UAP stuff. Um, no, I
I don't know that answer.
>> I mean, I I I I can only speculate, but
I mean I'm I'm guess I'm hoping, you
know, somebody like you, if I if I had
the clearances that you've got and I
went into the Pentagon, I think we've
all got this illusion, and I know it's
completely deluded. I think we've all
got this delusion that you can go into
somewhere like the Pentagon and whatever
dark secrets there are, you can pry them
out. You know, give us the reality,
Sarah. Do you think you know Do you
think you know everything that's going
on inside the Pentagon and inside the
intelligence?
>> I I don't want to know. I don't know. Um
what I have learned through this
journey, ignorance is bliss. And I there
are some things that I really I don't
need to know. I'm good with that. Um,
it's such a big building. I I tell my
mom and dad that it's like a city
itself. There's a cleaners in there.
There's all kinds of different
restaurants. There's a CVS and or
pharmacy for for those not in the US
that don't know what CVS is. Um, it's a
city. It's huge. And I purposely once in
a while will get will just go walk and
get lost just to try to find my way back
to my office because it's so big and I'm
still learning how to navigate. and I've
been there I don't even know five five
or six months now.
>> So give me your best guess. Give me your
analysis based on your intuitive
understanding that comes from your
psychic abilities but also from your
insights that you've gained on the job.
Explain what it is the anomalous
phenomenon that we're investigating.
What is it? Is it alien? Is it ETSs from
another planet? Is it interdimensional?
Is it God?
>> Um, almost all the above. I
It's a good question.
Um,
my spiritual side is saying God is in
all of us. And my spiritual side also
says we are all technically parts of
being aliens because we're made of the
stars. It's what we learned in astronomy
101 is we're we're star stuff and we're
all made of stars. Um,
what are they doing? It's
I've joked with people over the years
that I feel like Earth is is a little
bit of a zoo and they just come check on
us to see, oh, you know, go over a
nuclear site. Did they did they explode
you themselves yet? and and then pop in
and out, go, you know, they uh ocean's
vast, so they're able to go maybe hide a
little bit in the ocean when we are able
to see them like the few videos that we
have. Um
I
Oh man, I don't know how crazy you want
this to get, but spiritual side of
things, um I have heard lots of theories
and one I do believe is Earth is young
and we're kind of an experiment. So, uh,
some of the the benevolent beings want
to come here to make sure that we're
okay and maybe the the bad guys, like
the the malevolent entities aren't
trying to take over. Um,
>> so who are the good guys and who are the
bad guys amongst the NHI?
>> Yeah. Um, I'll start with bad. Um,
draconians, lizard people. A lot of
people joke about lizards and basically
all all politicians are the lizards type
thing. Um but yeah, dra draconians. Um
so a lot of them are are built are named
after a lot of constellations. Uh so
Arcturians are the good guys. I work
with them a lot during some of my
healing sessions and well I should say
they work with me um and let me know
that they are here. they visit to
try to make Earth a better place and
they know our human lives are kind of
slow compared to some of what they could
do, but they're here to help and to
guide. Um
I I I don't Do you want to do How deep
do you want to go?
>> Well, I mean, I'm f I'm fascinated. I
mean, one of the things that I've
actually had people say to me, and I've
got no evidence of this, and I'm just
fascinated by it, is that there is a
reptilian presence on this planet, and
it's fascinating hearing you say that.
Are am I are you able to tell me did you
see any evidence of beings in your work
at the UAP task force?
>> Uh, UAP task force, no. So, that when I
was on the task force, official duty on
the task force, we kept it strictly to
data. We did not talk about aliens at
all. We didn't discuss conspiracy
theories. We kept it strictly to data uh
because we were working on imagery from
what I was doing.
>> Forgive me for interrupting, but if say
somebody had secured video of a biologic
or an alien,
>> wouldn't that be data?
>> It would be. We never saw I never saw
that. I wish I would have. That would
have been cool, but no. I I I only
looked at aircraft. And so when you say
that you didn't come across it during
your time at the UAPF, where where have
you become aware of the presence of what
you say are reptilian beings?
>> Oh, that was through my spiritual side,
my spiritual work.
>> I have Uhhuh.
>> And forgive me. Sorry, I I I apologize
for interrupting.
When you talk about that, is that
something that you volunteered to your
colleagues at the UAPF? Because I'm
fascinated by the number of people in
defense and intelligence who say to me
privately that there is something to
this non-human intelligence idea of
different beings, blue beings,
reptilians, Nordics, grays, and it does
my head in because they're talking
candidly about this as a reality and
accepting it in quite a normal casual
play. And yet to my world view, we're
the only intelligent beings that I know
of at the moment. Well, yours is derived
from a spiritual understanding.
I I'm intrigued because there's a lot of
stories, a lot of legends, a lot of
mythology and um myth modern euphology
suggesting that there have been
interactions between humans and
different types of nonhuman
intelligence. And
have we I mean did you ever see any
evidence in your time at the UAP task
force for example that there were
agreements between humans and non-human
intelligences?
>> Um I never encountered it but I
know of stories of people uh prior to me
in prior programs that know of them.
And it's interesting because one of the
people I know you worked with was Jay
Stratton. And poor Jay and his family,
as you know, have had extraordinary
experiences since he returned from
Skinwalker Ranch with anomalous
phenomena
uh his family often in quite an
unpleasant way. Um
is this something that people on the UAP
task force talked about? I is, you know,
did people often have these kind of
anomalous experiences? Lu Lu Lzando, for
example, told me in interview how he and
his wife and family saw orbs often at
night, but also during the daytime in
the back garden, some kind of
intelligently guided orb that floated
through their house and through their
back garden. How many members of the UAP
task force had what appears to be NHI
clearly taking an interest in them?
Um, I don't I don't want to speak for
other people because that's that's their
story and maybe they'll come out and
talk, but there were a few of us that
have had personal encounters and some
some a little bit more intense than
others. Mine was good, but I also am
used to entities coming in my house and
talking with me as a medium, but
somebody, you know, you like you said
earlier, you wouldn't be okay with that.
Uh, so I have a different mindset from
when I have a visitor versus them
because I know what comes in my house is
going to be of love and light because I
put very strict boundaries and
protection up. Um, but not everybody
knows that, right? And not everybody
knows how to do that protection. I um,
yes, I'm trying to dance around
answering your question. Yes. Uh,
there's others that have had personal
encounters at some point in their life.
maybe not necessarily when they were on
the task force.
>> One of the things that I've been
researching very recently is people with
psionic abilities that the US
government, notably the US Air Force has
been taking a strong interest in. When
your psychic abilities came to the
attention of your managers in the
Department of Defense, was there ever
any attempt to recruit you into
something like the Gateway program to
study your psychic abilities?
>> Nope.
the one. It was never a conversation or
or anything like that. And when you were
a child, um, some of the people that
I've been talking to have gone through
the gifted and talented education
program in schools and they found
themselves diverted into programs that
were run by a private military
contractor overseen, we suspect, by the
US Air Force, which appears to have been
looking for children with alleged
psionic abilities. Do you did you ever
in your time as a child have any kind of
testing that made you wonder if you were
being tested for your psychic ability?
>> No. I I grew up in rural Missouri. If
somebody would have tested me, the whole
town would have known within 2.5
seconds.
It was no. And then then you would have
known the the strangers were in town and
they talked to Sarah. And so no, I'm
thankful that that didn't happen. One of
the things you've talked about in the
course of this conversation is, you
know, we've talked about God. We we've
talked about how you died and you feel
like you went to heaven. Are you
Christian? And do you think that those
beliefs, if you have them, mold your
perception of what you saw?
>> Um, yes. I grew up in a religious
household and I, you know, my spiritual
journey has taken me down a different
route. So, I don't consider myself
religious anymore. I'm definitely still
a Christian. and I pray to God and I
talk to God and I just I talk to a few
extra people now than I did before. Um I
I think how my journey has happened has
been a I mean there there's a
synchronicity to everything right um and
I think it it synchronized perfectly um
because if I would have done any of
those orders in a different manner I
might have a different perspective for
things but I think because of my
astronomy and the astrophysics
background it's also really opened kept
me open minded for all of this cuz even
in undergrad when I was a sophomore
somebody asked me
uh you know are we alone and I'm like
why would we be selfish enough to think
an infinite amount of space it's just us
and then the next question was but you
believe in God so how do you portray
infinite amount of space and I just it
was such a weird question to me because
I'm like why are those two separate
things Why why are it it was just it
blew my mind that people put things in
different buckets and uh the world
doesn't work like that.
It's interesting. A few months ago, we
had a conversation with Paul Thigpen,
who's quite a prominent theologian, and
we were talking about the ideas behind
UAPs. And Paul was arguing fundamentally
that they're not incompatible with
Christian beliefs or or any religious
beliefs that that if you look at
religion if you know I I made the
observation that if you go back through
religion it's possible to see a lot of
religious ideas through the notion that
in fact what we regard as spiritual
beings are in fact perhaps highly
intelligent super advanced technologies
that were engaging with humans at a time
when, you know, what was perhaps a a
spacecraft powered by anti-gravity
drives was described as a winged chariot
or a a glowing sphere in the book of
Ezekiel. What's your take on that?
>> Yeah, I totally agree. I So, I do
connect to angels very This is really
hard for me to I'm not used to just, you
know, talking I call it with muggles
about this. So,
>> no, it's funny. I mean, my it's funny. I
have a daughter who's um very similar to
you in in terms of your belief system
and she's constantly jolting my world
view and basically challenging me to be
more open-minded and and one of the
things that I find is the more I go down
this rabbit hole and and infuriate the
debunkers, I love it. You know, I get
these rabid messages from debunkers who
who are attacking me for taking
seriously things like psychic abilities,
things like near-death experiences, and
yet so many people are describing what
you're describing. I mean, they can't
all be deluded and wrong, can they?
>> Right. Um, I I think the truth is is
coming out. It's happening. Uh, in the
spiritual community, you call it an
awakening. And everybody, 100% of humans
that are born, we can all do what I'm
what I do. When I talk to loved ones, we
just lose the ability over time because
we're told it's not real. We're told
it's an imaginary friend or don't say
that this that's against God. And um so
we get it in our heads that it's not
right and to not talk about it. But if
you embrace it, it's actually brought me
closer to God. it's brought because I
could see it's it's hard to explain
because I get to see different things um
that others don't from a different
perspective as well. So your physics is
about reference points. If you are
solving an equation, your reference
point matters because if you change
that, you're going to get a different
answer. You're going to get a different
outcome. And I get to see multiple
reference points at one time and
multiple outcomes. And it's such a gift
that I hope to never take advantage of.
Um, but I also get to see, you know, the
bad as well that comes along with this.
And people are always going to believe
what they want. And that's fine. I'm I'm
not here to force somebody to believe
everything that I'm saying, but I'm
saying it with confidence, or else I
wouldn't be here. I'm not getting paid.
I'm I'm not, you know, nobody's sitting
on the other side of this laptop telling
me what to say. I I'm doing it to to try
to help um and try to educate. So, the
biggest thing is education and help the
awakening and kids now are starting to
be embrace more of the unknown and it is
such a marvelous thing to witness. So
I'm fascinated that you say that you
were in contact or you actually saw this
blue being because one of the things
that has really jolted my world view and
I you and I spoke about this privately
is that multiple people an alarming
number of people have contacted me from
all over the world since I started
talking about a person who told me that
they were being communicated with by a
blue being. And I'm somewhat embarrassed
and ashamed of myself to admit that
initially I was scoffing at the idea and
very very dismissive that a non-human
intelligence would reach out to an
individual human and impinge on their
consciousness and give them creative
ideas or intellectual ideas. But that's
exactly what people are describing to me
is going on that there is some kind of
seeding happening, some kind of exchange
of knowledge happening at the
consciousness level. And it often
involves beings or entities that when
you really push people, I mean, it
shocked me when you said earlier that
the being you saw in your bedroom was
blue because that just brought back the
familiar the familiar tones. All of the
accounts that you give are so familiar
to me.
Is there a mission that you believe
you've been imbued with? Have you been
conveyed the notion that you have an
obligation to make people more aware?
>> Um,
I don't think it's an obligation because
we still have free will. I think it's
um
I think it's time to wake more people
up. Um
>> but is that something is that is that
something that you've decided yourself
or do you think you've been given a
little nudge?
>> Oh, I for sure have had a nudge. I've
been having a nudge my whole life.
>> Yeah.
all of all of this roller coaster of a
journey has made sense. And the more
spiritual classes I take or the
certifications I get, it's just another
layer of ah this is why I'm here. This
is this is why God kicked me out of
heaven. Um different things that I've
been able to do at work of projects that
I've worked on and it's like ah okay
this is also why I was kicked out of
heaven. So it's um I definitely got a
nudge and I definitely am brave enough.
I have I was raised to be a very strong
independent woman and can do a lot on my
own and and take a take a lot of blows
and I have my whole life I've spoken up
for others as a group as a whole. Um
people have passed me words to speak for
them and I think now it's just another
layer of that.
>> Can I ask you this in closing? I think
we're getting close to having to wrap
soon but I'm so enjoying this
conversation. One of the excuses that's
often given to me privately by people of
deep religious belief and deep religious
conviction is that America particularly
is a very religious place that most
people believe in God. and the idea of
an ontological shock that that revealing
the existence of a non-human
intelligence would be of such a shock to
the populace that it would cause
widespread
um breakdown of society and um you know
a loss of the very structures of our
democracy. What do you say to that kind
of notion?
>> I I mean I totally agree. I think that's
why maybe some things haven't happened
in mass yet because of it would
economy. It would religion
around the world, not just our country.
It would uh it would hinder, you know,
gas like if they gave us their
technology, we don't need fossil fuels
anymore. It would it would impact
every single thing in our lives. And I
I'm excited for the day. I'm hopeful for
the day if they want to show up, but I I
think they will do it in a a baby step
type manner. Um I hope they do.
>> Do you think we're ready?
>> Um
will anyone ever be ready? I I think
that answer is probably no. So I I know
there's a lot out there that are I have
been receiving messages and a lot of
thing uh emails and stuff from people
that have had encounters. there's a lot
of people out there that definitely are
that there would be a lot of support of.
Um, so yeah, I overall yes, we're ready.
But
>> my analysis could never be scientific
because I'm only as good as the people
that contact me. But going on the people
that contact me and the volume of people
engaging with this subject, I get the
impression that the phenomenon is
showing itself far more overtly to
people at the moment. that there is a
very um intense effort by whatever it is
to make people aware of its existence.
Do you think we're close to some kind of
a disclosure moment? If not, I mean, I
certainly doubt the Pentagon's ever
going to stand up at lectern and tell
all, but do you think the NHI might be
positioning themselves at some stage to
reveal to us the manner of
>> Oh, absolutely. I 100% confidence. Yes,
I do think NHI are ready to come
forward. I think all of these like what
you said there things are happening more
frequently now and um I do think you
know disclosure is going to happen from
the public not from the government. Uh
the disclosure is going to happen and
the government's going to have to
backtrack and
yeah be open like oh yeah how about
that?
>> So why are they lying? Why not just tell
the truth?
um my personal Sarah opinion, this isn't
anybody else's. I just think that you
know at first they didn't know how to
tell the public and so buried it and and
that that mound of dirt that it was
buried under has now become a mountain
and maybe you don't know how to come
back from that. And also maybe things
were forgotten over the years and you
know people have passed away that had
some legacy knowledge so that went with
them because they never were able to
write it down because it was classified
and um so I think it was a multitude of
things um but again my personal opinion.
>> So Sarah how can people contact you if
they want to hear more from you and know
more about your work?
I am on Instagram. So Sarah Gracewarrior
and then yeah, I think that you could
Google my website. Um that's on there
too. So email is sarah
gracewarriorgmail.com
if you want to reach out there. Um on
LinkedIn I have had an influx of of
LinkedIn things. So I'm sorry I don't
get on there very much. But um yeah, I
think mostly Instagram is probably the
best way to to message or email. Well, I
for one take great heart from the fact
that the Pentagon, which is commonly
described and decrieded as this kind of
monolith of denialism and cover up,
actually has somebody as open-minded and
as spiritually interesting as you on
their on their staff. And uh it it makes
me feel better for the sake of humanity
that that you're you're in there with
all the secrets in your head. Sarah Gam,
thank you so much for speaking to
Reality Check.
>> Thank you. I appreciate your time.
>> Hello and welcome back to Reality Check.
Well, this week we have a guest I've
been wanting to get on for years. He's
one of the giants of UAP UFO research.
Robert Hastings. the man who exposed the
connection between the nukes that we
have, nuclear weapons, nuclear
facilities, nuclear power plants, and
UAPs. And today, he's going to explain
how he came to the conclusion there's a
link. But before I bring him in, I want
to paint you a word picture. Imagine a
16, 17year-old boy sweeping the floors
at the air traffic control tower at
Malmstrom Air Force Base in 1967.
That was young Robert Hastings. And he
worked there because his dad worked as a
US Air Force officer on the base. And in
the course of one evening, he was
summoned across to a radar screen by a
friendly air traffic controller who
pointed him to various targets on his
screen. They were anomalous objects
doing extraordinary things. And from
that moment on, Robert Hastings was
hooked. And thankfully that was the case
because Robert has provided us with
probably one of the most invaluable
pieces of research into the UAP
phenomenon. It's his work that has
cracked an area wide open, validated
with corroborated US Air Force and other
military documents. A secret that the US
Air Force has been at pains to try to
conceal for 60 or 70 years. The
injubitable link between UFOs and
nuclear weapons. Robert Hastings,
welcome to Reality Check. Sir,
I am delighted to announce that we have
a sponsor on Reality Check. And that
sponsor is none other than a martial
arts god that when I was a little boy, I
worshiped intensely. I had his posters
on my wall and he inspired me to learn
karate and other martial arts as a young
teenager. I'm talking about Chuck
Norris. When I was a little boy, there
was one movie that I went to watch about
five times in 1972 called The Way of the
Dragon. And it was Bruce Lee and Chuck
Norris facing off against each other in
the Colosseum in Rome. It was just
mighty stuff. And would you believe
Chuck Norris is now 84 years old. And
while I have broken hands and knees and

defies explanation. The man is 84 years
old and yet he's still got the vigor of
a man 30 or 40 years younger than him.
He's still kicking butt and working
hard. And what's amazing is he's
stronger. He can work out longer and has
plenty of energy left over for his
grandkids. He did this, he tells us, by
making one change. And he says he still
feels like he's in his 50s. His wife's
even done the same thing as well, and
she's never felt better. She says she
feels 10 years younger. Her body looks
leaner, and she has energy all day. And

Robert Hastings, welcome to Reality
Check. Sir, did you ever find out what
those objects were on that radar screen
that you saw as a teenage boy when you
saw them being tracked on the Malmstrom
Air Force Base screens? Uh the FAA
controller who pointed them out to me on
his screen, man named Bob Grasser, uh
simply said these were unknown targets.
I was walking by emptying his trash can
in a place called RapCon, radar approach
control. And um we had had previous
conversations about radar. He knew me.
He knew I was interested in radar. And
for whatever reason, he just kind of
nonchalantly said, "We're tracking
unknown targets." Or whatever words he
used. And I recall after this many years
getting very excited and peppering him
with questions and I think he kind of
did a double take and and realized I was
drawing attention to us from the other
controllers in the room and he kind of
backed off and said why don't you come
back later and clean up. Well, I cleaned
the rest of the tower about two hours
worth of work and when I returned to
Rapcon he clearly did not want to talk
about it. Uh, I worked every other day
and uh, two days later I caught him in
the break room and I said, "Were you
tracking UFOs the other night and again
he clearly did not want to talk about
it." However, uh, my father, who by the
way was a senior master sergeant, not an
officer, uh, worked at the NORAD North
American Aerospace Defense Command radar
facility on base called the Sage
Building, part of a a international
network with Canada, US and Canada. He
worked right in the military radar
building. And I went home that night and
was very excited. And he said, "I, you
know, I think the radar, you know,
tracking of UFOs went on tonight. I'm
not sure." Unbeknownst to me, he made
inquiries at work. And a few days later,
he confirmed that NORAD's facility did
track the objects and that the rumor
going around was that they were
maneuvering near nuclear missile sites.
These were bonafideed UFOs. So that
kicked everything off for me. You're
correct.
>> So obviously
there was a connection that was alerted
to you at that early stage. That's 57
years ago, Robert. 57 years ago you got
twigged to the fact that there's clearly
a connection between UFOs, these weird
objects in our skies, and nuclear
weapons. And it ended up with this
magnificent book that I recommend to
everybody I speak to, UFOs and nukes,
extraordinary encounters at nuclear
weapons sites, which is your definitive
explanation of all of the 167 plus
witnesses that I understand you've
interviewed who had direct knowledge of
these incursions. Can I ask you this?
Is there any nuclear site that you're
aware of in the United States that
hasn't had a UFO incursion?
I can't say that literally every nuclear
weapons related facility in the US has
been visited by UFOs. I can tell you
that all the major nuclear uh missile
bases both the ones that were
operational in the 60s and the 70s and
the ones that are currently operational
have been visited repeatedly year after
year according to the sources that I've
interviewed. Yes.
>> So as I understand it, you became aware
much later on as you started doing your
research. give me an idea of of what you
found out about Molmstrom Air Force Base
in the course of your research, which of
course was the the base where you'd
grown up as a young teenage boy.
>> Well, I was a teenager, as you said, and
I couldn't really do much with this
incredible information until I became
older. I went to college, got married,
and in the summer of 1973, I happened to
be researching various subjects in the
library and stumbled upon some UFO books
and magazines and discovered that J.
Alan Heinik, who was Project Blue Book's
civilian scientific consultant for many
years, had a year previous to my
experience at Malmstrom, had written an
article in the Saturday Evening Post
magazine, the December issue, in which
he said that UFOs were flying over
nuclear missiles at another base, Mine,
not in North Dakota. Uh, that just took
me a back. I went, "Holy cow." You know,
that's what I think went on at
Malmstrom. And apparently that's going
on various places. So that um that
prompted me really to start seeking out
informally, very sporadically uh
military veterans who might have
knowledge of these cases. And by the
late 70s, I had about 25 witnesses who
were in various positions in the Air
Force but were personally aware of uh
UFO incursions at nuclear weapons sites,
missile sites primarily. And uh I was so
intrigued by this and felt that it was
such an important subject that the
public should be made aware of the
secret. And I quit my job, went out on
the college lecture circuit, almost
starved to death, but uh began a career
of speaking at public uh venues, US
colleges and and universities about this
topic.
Can I tell you, Robert, that the thing I
want people to know is how reverently
you are held by the people in the know,
not just people that I know on the
inside who are aware of the connection
between UAPs and nukes and who tell me
constantly that there is clearly some
interest by whatever these NHI are in uh
nuclear weapons facilities, but also
people like Lou Alzando, how put off all
of these people who've spoken out about
the issue. They speak with absolutely
huge respect for the work that you've
done. And the thing I notice is, as far
as I can see, you've never been
debunked. You've never been savaged by
the Splenetic debunkers. Nobody can lay
a glove on you because the thing I
admire about your work is you've been
able to find firthand
direct witnesses to some of these
incidents. many of these incidents and
moreover you've been able to corroborate
them with US Air Force military records.
Take me through how you did that and
take me through the kind of
corroboration that you found yourself
discovering.
>> Um the number of veterans that I
encountered over time increased uh
significantly after I went out on the
lecture circuit in September of 81. I
discovered that most of my lectures
there were members of the military in
the audience, some of whom came up to me
afterwards and said, "I know what you're
talking about. I was at such and such a
base and this is what happened." Some of
them I asked each and every one of them
whether we could discuss this later and
you know get a formal interview from
them. Some said yes, some said no. And
uh over time, one by one, uh veterans
came to me or I sought them out because
I had heard through the grapevine that
someone might know something. And one by
one, I learned that uh you know, this
activity had gone on. Um so
I can't tell you why I've been so
obsessed by it, but I figured if I was
going to do this, I should do it as well
as possible. I tried to take a
journalistic approach. I vetted these
witnesses. I got what was called their
DD214 records which confirmed the
positions they held in the Air Force and
at what bases during what time frames.
Uh those kinds of documents wouldn't
have any reference to a UFO encounter
they might have witnessed, but it did
confirm that they were who they said
they were in the military. And um so
just one thing led to another. And uh
it's it's so dramatic. I I really
retired from all of this in 2012 uh due
to advancing age and some significant
health issues I have. But uh I'm sure
it's still going on today. And uh if
there are persons in the military,
ex-military I should say, who are
watching this who want to contact me,
Ross uh can provide my contact
information. And um I'm I'm still
interested in learning as much as I can
about this.
Sir, let's talk about specifics, Robert.
I mean, let's talk about, say, the Minot
case in Dakota. Talk me through what
happened, what you discovered happened.
Uh, at any given base, there were many,
many instances over the years, which is
why my book is 500 pages long. Uh at May
not the most dramatic incident and
perhaps at any base as a matter of fact
uh was a conversation I had with a man
named David Shore SUR
who was a Minuteman nuclear missile
launch officer in the 1960s at that
base. And what he told me in 2007 and
again I have audio tape uh record of all
the conversations I've done with these
gentlemen. Uh what he said was one night
in 1966 or perhaps 67 uh his guards up
at ground level uh he was underground of
course in the launch control capsule. Uh
his guards at ground level called down
to the capsule and suddenly reported an
object moving from missile to missile
and it clearly was a self-illuminated
object. It was moving in a in a erratic
manner that no aircraft could match and
you know it was clearly something
significant. uh almost immediately
according to Captain Shore, he told me
that the launch uh activation lights on
his console lit up. In other words, as
this object hovered over a given
missile, that missile suddenly went into
launch countdown, which of course is
terrifying. I mean, had it gone to its
conclusion, it could have been World War
II. And so, one by one, he thinks it was
seven or eight missiles. uh he had to
flip what's called an inhibit switch uh
to in effect neutralize this launch
countdown. What he heard over a a uh
secure communication system that linked
all the capsules together. There were I
think 15 launch control capsules at the
base controlling 150 missiles total.
What he was hearing is this object moved
between his group his group of 10
missiles to the next group to the next
group to the next group and over the
space of about an hour virtually every
group of missiles called a flight of 10
missiles was visited by this object. Uh
Shore could not remember in 2007 whether
other men were reporting other launch
officers were reporting that their
missiles had been activated but he knew
his were. And uh when he went to the
base the next day uh you know it was the
end of his shift and he was preparing to
be de debriefed he and his commander uh
the uh squadron commander said to them
nothing happened nothing to discuss go
home. Now what sh what sh suspects is
that other crews had arrived at the base
earlier than he he and his commander and
they were debriefed and uh briefed
debriefed rather and uh so people on the
base already knew what had occurred.
They didn't need to hear it again and
again from various crews that arrived
back at the base. But obviously you know
tremendously important incident.
>> That's what I don't understand though
Robert. Why on earth? I mean, accepting
that it's embarrassing for the Air Force
and accepting that it shows that
something was able to compromise the
most secure coding and uh protection
systems to stop these missiles from
being activated. But why on earth would
the Air Force want to suppress the fact
that something was able to so easily
activate their missiles? I mean, why I
mean, why why hide something like that?
I think in the first instance, you
really wouldn't want to let the your
adversary, in this case, the Soviet
Union, know that we were having trouble
with our missiles being knocked offline
or even activated. Uh, as you know from
another case at Mount 67, Bob Salis, a
former launch officer, said that his
missiles were knocked offline. They
weren't activated. They suddenly were
dysfunctional. Um you certainly in the
first instance would not want your
adversary to know that your first you
know um strategic line of defense or
offense was was not operational.
More importantly I think uh the
government just basically has decided
for decades now that the public not only
Americans but the world is not ready for
the big secret that these things are
from somewhere else. They're not humans
that were flying these craft. And so
this is just another example of
something that had to be hidden to keep
the overall cover up intact.
>> That's the really interesting part about
your story. I I knew because I
interviewed, as you know, Robert Salis
uh very early on in my cadet ship into
UAPology. And uh Robert basically woke
me up to the fact that there were
missiles that had been um
deactivated like they were basically not
able to if they'd wanted to launch they
wouldn't have been able to launch. And
that to me was if you like a
demonstration by whatever these objects
were that they could meddle with the
systems but I didn't realize until very
recently when I read your account of Mr.
sure that in fact there had been what
had also happened in the Soviet Union a
demonstration of an activation of a
missile. Now just explain to the lay
observers watching this Robert how
careful the encryption and coding and
security systems are on missiles to stop
them from being launched. the fact of
activation of missiles, the fact that in
the shure case at um May not you you had
a situation where even though the
president hadn't issued a launch order,
there'd been no turning of the keys,
something had been able to do this.
>> Um I'm not an expert as far as all the
technical procedures involved with the
missile systems. I know what my sources
have told me how things work in a
general sense. Um, but I do know that
and Bob Salace has explained this uh a
number of times in each uh launch
control facility which controlled 10
missiles. Each missile was independently
uh segregated from the others and in
terms of electronics and for something
to take down 10 missiles all at once uh
was just not simply feasible or or
possible based on their knowledge of the
system. And yet it did occur. Uh, by the
way, it's based on the time frame of the
incident I w witnessed at the air
traffic control tower. It's conceivable
that I witnessed Bob Salas's event. Uh,
it occurred that spring in March of 67
and it occurred in the evening. I worked
from roughly 7 to 10 p.m. And so I may
have indeed witnessed what he was
experiencing out out at the missile
site. Um, let me also point out that um,
I think whoever's flying these craft are
demonstrating first that they're
interested in the fact that we have
nuclear weapons and that we've
threatened to use them, you know, for
50, 60 years now. And I think that's of
concern to them. Uh, maybe for
altruistic reasons, maybe for selfish
reasons. if they have plans and projects
here on Earth, if they're involved in
some way on this planet, uh a massive
nuclear conflict would affect their
projects and and plans just as much as,
you know, human civilization would be
impacted. When uh in the case of David
Shor's experience, when the missiles
were actually temporarily activated, my
opinion is that they weren't uh they and
the UFOs were not attempting to start
World War II. I think they were simply
demonstrating, hey, we're in control of
your weapons whether you like it or not.
Here's what we can do. And they probably
knew in fact that David Shore and the
other officers could shut down the
launch. And so they weren't really
generating, you know, they weren't
trying to start World War II. We know
that, you alluded briefly to an incident
in 1982 in the Soviet Union, which
George Na uh journalist George Knapp has
brought to our attention. uh he smuggled
he smuggled hundreds of documents out of
Russia in 1994
some of which dealt with nuclear weapons
related cases in the Soviet Union and in
October of 82 in Soviet Ukraine there
was actually an incident very similar to
what David Shurer described to me where
suddenly uh several missiles unspecified
number of missiles went into activation
were preparing to launch and for 15
seconds it appeared World War II was
going to start and we now know from
interviews that have taken place in the
last 10 years in Russia that some of the
men who were on site when that occurred,
they were just utterly terrified. They
thought it was World War II. They had no
idea what was occurring. Uh so again, in
my view, my humble opinion is that these
entities are not human uh are just
simply trying to demonstrate, you know,
you're playing with fire, you stupid
humans. You know, you better think twice
about all of this.
I was told once by a friend of Edgar
Mitchell that he took the view that it
was the non-human intelligence is saying
the kitties are playing with matches.
You know, we we need to stop them from
doing this full hearty thing.
>> Have you ever seen in any of your
research from any of the witnesses, has
there ever been any indication of any
kind of malevolence or bad intention
from the phenomenon that you've
witnessed tampering or incurring on
these sites?
>> Not that I'm aware of. You know, I'm
aware of things that I've read um both
prior to the internet and now on the
internet, stories of what seem to be
nefarious activity on the part of these
entities, but those seem to be few and
far between as far as I can tell. And um
you know I who knows who they are and
what they're up to and what their
intentions are, but um you know on the
whole you know I'm sure the people at
the Pentagon aren't aren't happy about
these situations, but I view it as an
encouraging development that somebody is
uh you know demonstrating they can
control our weapons and the Russians
weapons and hopefully that's for a good
purpose.
So, one of the things that you have been
able to do, Robert, is obtain on freedom
of information requests
information that in military documents
confirms some of these incidents that
you've been told about. Uh, can I take
you to a few of those? I mean, for
example, in um August of 1966, there's a
document right Patterson Air Force Base
um uh there was a report of a round disc
object traveling um uh back and forth
and up and down. Uh verified from
100,000 ft to 4,000 ft. Um climbed out
of sight. Uh duration three and a half
hours. incredibly detailed report. Um,
take me through that if you can recall
that one or if you want to site any
other of these cases. Take me through
any of these FOIs that you've been able
to obtain.
>> Well, first of all, I need to say that I
made efforts beginning in the early
1980s to access documents through the
Freedom of Information Act. Uh, in
particular, my sources said that they
had been debriefed by OSI, Air Force
Office of Special Investigations agents.
And that's probably where the
interrogatories um existed, the records
of the the debriefings and so on. I
repeatedly tried in the early 80s to get
documents from OSI and got the door
slammed in my face each and every time.
So I actually have not been successful
in in accessing documents myself, but
fortunately other people have. uh Barry
Greenwood who is a very respected
researcher and document uh analyst. He's
acquired God knows how many documents
and some of which refer to the nuclear
weapons cases. Uh the late Todd Zeo who
actually launched a lawsuit against the
CIA in 77 I think uh access documents
through the FOIA. And uh the one that I
think is most telling that I used to
present in my lecture program was from
Malm Air Force Base in November of 75.
Uh there were I think it was over a
three-ight period. There were multiple
incursions of discshaped craft and some
were described as cigar- shaped uh
flying around Malmstrom's nuclear
missile sites. Uh at one point the
document indicates that jet fighters
were launched to attempt to intercept
these objects whereupon the the UFOs
left the vicinity. They waited for the
jets to leave and go back to base and
then they came back and began hovering
around the missiles again. Uh they
clearly, you know, are playing cat-mouse
with with the jets. So I think that was
that's a pretty good example of the
kinds of incidents that I've been
investigating.
So, Robert, what if any official
military or intelligence or government
uh comment has ever been made about the
allegations you make of a nexus between
UFOs and nukes? Um, it's more of an
informal kind of uh surveillance of my
own activities uh rather than I'm I'm
unaware of any formal announcement where
anyone at the Pentagon has gotten on a
podium and said, you know, no, they're
not messing with our nuclear weapons.
That's all wrong. Uh they they they
don't want to touch the subject, so
they're ignoring it. Um but I began
speaking at at schools, colleges, and
universities in September of 81. Uh, as
I mentioned earlier, sometimes veterans
attended my lectures. I subsequently
arranged telephone interviews with them.
In February of 82, when I got off the
road after several weeks of my first uh
efforts at lecturing about all of this,
I began calling I think it was probably
six or seven Air Force veterans who'd
said they they'd be willing to talk with
me and with their permission would
record the conversations over the phone.
uh they they told me various things at
various bases during various time
frames. I would thank them for speaking
with me and say something like you know
someday I'm probably going to write a
book and I'll put your interview in the
book. Everyone said fine. I hung up the
phone after each call and within a
minute or two I would get another call.
Nobody saying anything into the phone
just breathing heavily and then hanging
up. And that happened after each and
every one of these calls to the
veterans. So, I went, "Okay, I'm on
someone's radar." You know, someone's
keeping an eye on me all of a sudden.
And frankly, it frightened me for a
while. I didn't know what might occur
next. You know, would I be uh physically
assaulted? Would I be, you know,
attacked in in legal way, illegal way? I
was the FBI going to show up at my door.
I had no idea. I knew I was, you know,
skirting the law in in the the effect in
the sense that these were still
classified incidents as far as the
Pentagon was concerned. Me publicizing
these gentlemen's testimony was breaking
the law was exposing classified
information. So, I got that. I knew that
and I just felt that the public's right
to know was more important than that
principle. And so I finally just decided
after several weeks either I was going
to do this or I wasn't. And I decided I
was. And so it's been decades of of
efforts to find the the facts.
So aside from that obvious harassment,
was there ever any more overt threat
made to you by anyone in authority to
try to discourage you from doing what
you were doing, investigating the
phenomenon over these nuclear weapons
sites? No one ever did show up my at my
door. Um, another researcher whose name
I'm spacing at the moment. I gave him
permission to try to find whether any
agency had files on me. He did get a
confirmation from the FBI. I've got the
letter that they did check their index.
They found that they had records on me.
Uh, they claimed that when they went to
search for those records, they were
missing, which I don't believe for a
second. Uh, as far as the CIA and the
NSA, the National Security Agency, the
letters I got from them said basically
we can neither confirm or or deny nor
deny. Uh, so, you know, I'm sure they're
watching me. I'm sure that uh they they
haven't lost sight of whatever I'm up
to. Uh, we could spend a lot of time
talking about the telephone and email
issues that I've had even within the
past week. Uh, so someone someone's
keeping an eye on me. It is what it is.
>> You went on to make a brilliant
documentary, UFOs and nukes, the secret
link revealed.
What was the key part in that film that
you enjoyed telling the most? Was it the
the Malmstrom or May not incidents? What
were what were the events that you
really enjoyed revealing most of all?
Well, let me say that uh over a several
decade period, I was approached by 21
different documentary film companies who
wanted to do a documentary with me. And
either because of their track record, I
knew what what some of their previous
work was, or the fact that they weren't
prepared to allow me to have editorial
control, that is what's called script
approval. I declined to be involved with
any of them. Uh I so in 2014 I believe
uh a very good friend and wealthy
benefactor named Jared Tarbell uh
graciously provided the money for me to
create my own doc documentary. Uh I did
the best I could. I'm not a filmmaker,
but it's gotten good reviews and uh what
I've tried to do is just systematically
go year after year and describe some of
the cases that I that I was aware of. Um
to to your point uh the most important
case I think uh one of the most
important cases is called the big su
incident. Uh there's a man named Dr. Bob
Jacobs in 1964. He was stationed at
mounds or excuse me Vandenberg Air Force
Base in California and he was the head
of a photographic team. They had a
telescopic camera they photographed
missile launches through. And um one day
in September of ' 64, they were just
filming this rocket launch, this missile
launch. And when they got back to base,
uh Dr. Dr. uh Jacobs was called into a
man named Floren's Mansman, Major
Floren's Mansman's office and a
projector was set up and there were two
guys in gray suits sitting in the room,
not saying much. And the major said,
"Lieutenant Jacobs, watch this." And
Jacobs was stunned to see that when the
dummy nuclear warhead separated from the
missile shortly thereafter, a bright
point of light came in out of nowhere
and circled the warhead and flashed four
different beams of light at it before
racing away whereupon the warhead began
tumbling and fell into the Pacific Ocean
hundreds of miles short of its target.
Now Jacob's uh major mansman rather told
Jacobs, you know, this never happened.
Don't ever mention this again. Uh Bob
Jacobs kept his silence until the early
80s. He finally wrote an article in a
magazine about it and at which point he
began getting death threats over the
telephone. Uh they actually even blew up
his his rural mailbox at one point uh as
they were talking to him over the phone.
So he and his wife were threatened with
death after he went sto went public with
this story about a UFO shooting down a
nuclear warhead. Um, backing up at the
time, Major Mansman, it was not known
for 20 years, but Major Mansman has
admitted in writing that he did a frame
by frame analysis of the film using a
magnifier. And this little point of
light on the film that circled the
warhead was actually a discshaped object
with a dome. And he could see enough
detail that before each flash of light,
the four beams of light occurred, this
object pivoted on its vertical axis,
fired the beam, and pivoted back. So he
could see a wealth of detail not not
only about its shape but its actions.
And um you know that's I mean how can
you how can you not think that that's
amazing? I mean you've got not only UFOs
hovering above our missiles in the
ground in their silos, you've actually
got them pacing in near space and on at
least on one occasion shooting a warhead
down to demonstrate their abilities. Let
me just briefly add that in the last six
months or so uh Lou Alzando I heard
through the grapevine had seen this film
while he was with ATIP and Lu Alzando
has now publicly confirmed that he
didn't see did indeed see the big su
film and that it showed exactly what Bob
Jacob said it showed.
>> Now that's a very important point Robert
because of course the film that you're
talking about has never been publicly
released. It's always been withheld from
the public and there's always been some
question mark about whether or not it
still existed. So to be very very clear,
you're saying that Lu Lzando and I've
I've watched the same interview and Lou
does seem to indicate this. He's
suggesting that he's actually seen the
big su film where a dummy inert nuclear
missile warhead is knocked out by a UFO.
Actually, Lou had read my book while he
was with that ATIP. Uh, how put off the
scientist for the group, presented a
copy of my book to Lou. Uh, he
apparently learned about Big Su by
reading my book and subsequently
attempted to get the film, and he's now
on the record of saying he was provided
with the film. It did show what Bob
Jacobs said it showed. Now, I think it
was in March of 23,
uh, this information was conveyed to
Sean Kurpatre of Arrow. And Shawn
allegedly looked for the film and
claimed that he couldn't find it. Uh,
and Lou's response to that between you
and me and the rest of the world was
 And so, you know, that's where
we are. That's the last I've heard about
this particular episode.
>> Can I ask you this, Robert, while we're
here? Do you think that ARO, the
Pentagon's UFO UAP investigation office,
is an organization that under Dr. Sha
Kirkpatrick was credibly investigating,
objectively investigating the UAP issue
for the public?
>> No, I don't. I think it was a front
organization for probably CIA or someone
like that. I don't think there was any
serious effort or intention to seriously
investigate the UFO phenomenon. I think
uh Kurpatre was a shill. I'm afraid that
anyone who's going to be a successor in
in that organization really has his
hands tied whatever his personal belief
and wishes may be. Uh I I have enough
contacts I have a few contacts former
and retired high level uh intelligence
community and DoD defense department
personnel who said you know this the the
powers that be the people that have kept
the secrecy for decades they have not
changed their stance. They're digging in
their heels. They're very upset by Lou
Alzando and David Gush and probably me
and people like me who are trying to get
the facts out. And you know, they're
saying to me, don't expect Arrow to do
anything groundbreaking or
earthshattering in terms of revealing
anything substantive.
>> So, let's come back to the Big Su
incident for a moment. You made the
point, but I want to reinforce this with
our audience because I to me it was one
of the most persuasive things when I did
my interview with Dr. to Bob Jacobs.
Obviously, you had Bob's testimony as a
witness, saying that this is what he
what happened. He was with Florence
Mansman, his commanding officer, and in
the presence of these two spooks,
presumably from Air Force Office of
Special Investigations or something like
that. And he was told to shut up about
it. And really, at the time, it was his
word against the national security
establishments that this actually
happened. But just to reinforce the
point that you were making, and this was
a kicker for me in writing my book,
Mansman
years later when Bob Jacobs was being
savaged by debunkers and was being
accused of making this whole story up
about the big su missile being knocked
out by a UFO. Mansman showed enormous
courage and corroborated what Dr. Bob
Jacobs said, didn't he?
>> He did. Uh, I've got probably 10 private
letters written between Jacobs and
Mansman and other a couple of other
researchers that were communicating with
them in which Mansman says repeatedly
that what Bob has said is 100% accurate.
Again, this was decades before Lou
Alzando confirmed it. Uh he did by the
way at one point uh in several of these
letters identify those persons in the
office back in ' 64 as CIA officers and
that they had shown his his uh that
showed him their identification
confirming they were CIA. So I find it
interesting
among other things that the people who
confiscated the film after the screening
in the office, the film was confiscated
and flown back east, quote unquote,
according to Major Mansman. Um I find it
interesting that it was not released to
an Air Force uh group, but was released
to CIA. And they do seem to be running
the show. uh multiple sources over the
years have said publicly, researchers
and uh sources who have a background in
the intelligence community that the
group that's been running the show since
the early 50s is indeed the Central
Intelligence Agency.
So on its face, I mean just that one
incident at Big Su, you've got Bob
Jacobs looking through a telescope or
shooting through a telescope and then
later on he sees the film that shows
categorically corroborated by Commander
Meman
image of a craft of some kind, a disc of
some kind shooting some kind of light
that essentially knocked out this
missile. I mean it's quite extraordinary
that there's been no simple effort by
the government to respond to that. I
mean if they if they if there was
nothing to this you would think that
they would make a statement and
categorically deny it.
>> Uh again I think that the strategy has
been just don't touch it. You know you
do not confirm or deny it. Um, even if
at some point when I think it has to
happen eventually, some president and
hopefully in conjunction with world
leaders are are going to let the
citizens of the world, all us humans in
on the secret that this is in fact
non-human intelligence. They've been
here for a long long time. But I'm quite
sure that they're not going to be
talking about these entities shutting
down or activating our nuclear weapons
for some time, even after that
announcement is made. you you really
don't want to uh start out by talking
about that kind of dramatic um you know
development. So it could be it could be
many many more years before the
confirmation of this nuclear weapons
related activity comes to the four. you
you focused a lot of your work obviously
on nuclear weapons sites, but as I
understand it, the the history of this
phenomenon goes right back to even
places where nuclear weapons were being
built, but also there's a lot of
sightings that are on the MUON database,
I've noticed, of nuclear
uh power sites where the craft or
whatever they are appear to be taking an
interest in nuclear power stations. Have
you done any research or work into any
of those other areas like for example
the places where nuclear bombs are built
or where power stations are operating?
>> Uh I in terms of the civilian power
plants, no I have not. Uh I'm aware of
the cases that have been reported
publicly but I have not investigated
those. I sort of had my hands full with
whatever other professional activities I
had going on and um you so I just
focused on the military cases over the
years. But the first incident that I'm
aware of really was before even the the
atomic bombings of Japan. Uh a man named
Bud Clem who was a former Navy uh
fighter pilot during World War II. His
squadron was stationed in Washington
state at a place called Naval Air
Station Pasco, which was right across
the river from the Hanford plutonium
production facility. That site created
the plutonium not only for the Trinity
site blast in New Mexico in July of 45,
but also the bomb that was dropped on
Nagasaki. Uh the Hiroshima bomb was a
Ukraine uraniumbased bomb. Uh Bud Clem
told me in 2009 that on uh three
separate occasions, a self-elilluminated
bright object hovered right over the
Hanford plant and his squadron uh sent
up a fighter, a Hellcat prop fighter,
World War II fighter to chase the thing,
at which point the object moved away at
a high rate of speed, leaving the the
plane in the dust. That occurred on
three occasions to Bud Clem. Now, a
researcher named Jan Aldrich
subsequently found documents from the
Fourth Army that were declassified, I
believe, at the National Archives, and
indeed it confirmed there were three
unknown aerial objects that had hovered
over the Hanford plant in January of 45.
So, you've got uh a pilot's testimony
and documents confirming radar tracking
of these objects. That was a good seven
months I think before seven or eight
months before uh the bombs were dropped
on Japan. So whoever these guys are uh
they were well aware that we were
creating nuclear weapons even before
they were were detonated in in later in
45.
>> So you've implied to me Robert or
expressly stated in the earlier part of
this interview that you think that these
are some kind of nonhuman intelligence.
Why do you rule out the possibility that
it could be a foreign adversary?
Uh I think um first of all that the
incidents that are being described to me
occurred in the 40s. I mean the the and
they're describing craft that are silent
that are capable of fly flying thousands
of miles per hour stopping
instantaneously
and you know things that no no country
on earth had in 1945 or the late 40s. So
I think we were clearly dealing with an
outside party and u you know who knows
are these from another dimension of
reality. Are these from somewhere else
in the universe and they've figured out
how to travel between their star system
and ours easily to come here repeatedly?
Who knows what the bottom line answers
are? But I think nonhuman intelligence
is probably the the best best way to
describe what they are. Um let me give
you the classic debunker rejoinder there
which is why on earth if there is and we
all accept according to the fermy
paradox you know there must be
intelligent life out there but why would
intelligent life be borrow bothered with
us primitive apes why would they you
know chug vast distances light years
across the universe to come to this
speck of dirt and and and harass us
about our nuclear weapons
>> uh I I I take the argument back back to
forward you know, backwards to forwards
and let's start with the fact that this
is going on and we've got credible
sources saying it's going on. So, it's
occurring. So, we have to find an
explanation for it. So, rather than
theoretically saying if I were an alien,
I wouldn't do this, I wouldn't do that.
You know, just let's look at the
available data. The data are somebody's
here. They have technology that are
orders of magnitude beyond what we have.
They've been visiting our nuclear sites
since the late 40s. you can I think
infer that something is going on that's
beyond the human scope or the human
abilities human ability set. So that
would be my response to that. I think,
you know, self-evidently,
uh, if these stories about recovered
alien bodies and craft that David Grush,
for example, have described before
Congress last year, if those are borne
out, then there you go. You've got the
evidence. But until something like that
is, you know, available in the public
domain and there's no doubt any longer,
I think all of us, all we can do is
provide our our best assessment of the
available data. And that's mine.
Where do you stand, Rob, on I mean I
know Lu Lzando, for example, often talks
about the national security threat or
the flight safety threat posed by these
objects and some people often have a
swipe at me actually for for reinforcing
that and basically saying that by
definition anything that's breaking into
national security airspace and hovering
over nuclear weapons facilities is by
definition a threat. That's not to fear.
it's purely and simply a threat until we
know what it is. Where do you stand on
that? What's your view on the idea that
this is some kind of national security
threat?
>> I understand that's position. I've
spoken with him a number of times. I was
fortunate to have him all to myself for
two days in 2018 to ask him every
question under the sun. Um, you know, I
know it given his background, given his
responsibilities, he has to be cautious.
he has to assume the worst. Uh people
who, for example, like Jim Seavan, who
I'm in touch with, former high level CIA
officer, you know, his position is we
have to be concerned about what they're
up to because it could be nefarious. And
I get that and you would want them to
have that position. Uh it's just my my
hope and my belief that it's not dire.
It's not threatening to our species. uh
if the Pentagon is uh using our best
efforts to duplicate the technology, you
know, in private, if in doing we do
indeed have crash craft, if they don't
want it come out made public that this
is the case that we have alien visitors,
so to speak, then in my view, that's not
a good enough reason to keep the rest of
humanity in in the dark forever and
ever. You know, we need to know the
facts. And but I I understand L's
position on that.
It's not just an American phenomenon
either. I mean that's the other debunk
splenetic rant which is oh you know why
is this happening you know just over
America you know it only ever seems to
happen in America. What's your rejoinder
to that?
>> Anyone who's familiar with sighting
reports they're worldwide. They're
global. Um you know so certainly it's
not an American issue. Um, I I
you know, I think it's skewed depending
on the country you're in. You probably
hear more about your own country. I
don't know that much about what's
occurred in Australia except the
well-known cases that have been reported
over the years. So, you probably have a
much better handle on that than I do.
Um, so it is global. Anyone who takes
the time to look at the available data
uh before drawing conclusions will know
that it's not just an American issue.
So, let's talk about the other side of
your experiences, Robert, because not
only are you a dogged researcher and
investigator, you are also an
experiencer. And you and Dr. Bob Jacobs
only revealed very very recently in 2019
in a book called Confession, Our Hidden
Alien Encounters Revealed, you revealed
that both you and Bob were both
experiences. Tell me about that.
>> Um, hitherto. I mean, everything we've
discussed to this point I've tried to
put in terms of uh nuts and bolts data
reports by military personnel. Uh that
was my whole modest operandi just to get
as many of those guys on the record as
possible. Um and so again I went on the
lecture circuit in 81. Uh in 1988 I was
involved in a camping trip uh with
several other people. Long story short,
what occurred during that trip led me to
believe beyond any question that in fact
I had been abducted by nonhuman
entities. Now, uh, the circumstances
were such that I I went, you know, can
this really be happening? You know, I I
I never expected this. It's going to
greatly compliment complicate the fact
that I'm trying to tell lecture
audiences all over America that this is
a very nuts andbolt problem. The
military is up to, you know, their ears
with this and they're trying to keep it
from the public. If I suddenly from the
podium tell people that I've been
abducted by aliens, what's that going to
do with my to my credibility? Uh alien
abduction is just a subject that's too
far a bridge too far for many many
people. Nevertheless, uh from 1988
through the 90s into the early 2000s, I
had multiple experiences that I have
concluded were indeed abduction
experiences.
And um because I did want to maximize
the usefulness that I might have
convincing people about a nuclear
weapons link with UFOs, I chose to keep
that secret. It was a strategic decision
on my part. Uh in 2017, I was diagnosed
with a serious heart condition. Uh it's
affected my ability to do the things
that I've been wanting to do for the
last few years. But, uh, at around the
same time, Bob Jacobs, who I had ongoing
contact with, said, "You know, neither
of us are getting any younger, uh, if
we're going to be true to ourselves and
not be hypocritical, we really should
tell other humans that the rest of the
story." And so, we just bit the bullet
and and wrote that book and laid out as
best as possible what we know uh, has
occurred to us. Now, um, my attitude is
take it or leave it on the abduction
phenomenon. I get it. If some people
just can't grapple with that. Uh, if it
hadn't happened to me, I perhaps would
be more dubious myself, but I really
can't explain away the things that have
happened to me repeatedly, which it's
too complex a subject to go into here. I
>> I would like to at least get into some
of the detail of what you mean when you
say abduction. Can you describe to me a
typical event that you've endured?
>> Um, one of the most dramatic. Um, I was
in a hotel room in Pittsburgh. This
would have been early 1995.
Uh, I had already had a number of
encounters that I had some conscious
memories of and later uh got me
additional memories uh through hypno
hypnotic recall. It's a controversial
subject in itself, but I did have
conscious memory of certain other
experiences. So, by early 95, I was
already aware that something was going
on that was quite real, quite alarming,
something that I couldn't control. Um,
so I was in this hotel room in
Pittsburgh near the airport and suddenly
the room was dark. I was awakened at
night, suddenly out of sleep, and I got
in my mind what clearly was a message, a
telepathic message that said, "We are
here for you. You've met us before." And
if one hasn't had one of those
experiences, it's really hard to explain
how it feels or what it what it seems
like. But when it happens, it's quite
clear that it's real. It's not your
imagination. And no sooner had that
happened, I I uttered out loud, "They're
here." I was scared. I was terrified.
And no sooner had I uttered those words,
I levitated off the bed. My body was
airborne. And I was heading up to the
ceiling. I was wide awake. I was not
dreaming. I was not hallucinating. I was
not having sleep paralysis. I was in the
air heading up toward the ceiling. And
after perhaps five or six seconds, uh, I
blacked out apparently because what
seemed like the next instant, the room
was flooded with daylight, I was laying
back on the bed. And several hours had
passed. Now, when I laid there and tried
to gather my wits and go, "Oh my god."
You know, even with all the other things
that had happened to me, I never
levitated, you know, literally
levitated. So, I was trying to grapple
with all of that. I finally got up and
went outside. Well, first of all, I went
to the bathroom, turned on the light
switch. No electricity that the power
had been killed in in the hotel. There
was no power. They had a power failure.
Uh I finally went outside and uh there
was a fire engine in the parking lot
with a fireman leaning against it,
smoking a cigarette. And I said, "Is
there a fire in the hotel?" And he was
waving a cigarette around and saying,
"No, it's it's real puzzling. Uh this
hotel," he pointed to mine. He said the
one next to it had a power failure
overnight and the then he turned and
said all those restaurants on the other
side of the street are on the same grid
and they're just fine. So we're trying
to figure out why these two hotels lost
power. Well, if anyone's reviewed a
number of UFO sightings and incidents in
the literature, power failures are
something that's a signature with many,
many cases where people are seeing an
object and the power goes dead. So, I'm
pretty sure I know why the power went
off at my hotel. Um, you know, again, I
can't prove any of this, but it
happened.
>> Why Why would a nonhuman intelligence
want to abduct
Bob Hastings?
>> Uh, that's something I've asked myself
countless times. I don't have the answer
to. Um, I should add that of the 167
military witnesses that I've interviewed
over the decades, seven of them have had
abduction experiences that I'm aware of.
And in fact, uh, this past June, I
invited them to my house here in
Colorado. And we were basically
comparing notes and just trying to make
sense of all of this. Uh, you know, what
happened to you? What do you think it
is? And so on, but none of us has have
any answers. But um based on our our
conscious recollections in some cases
hypnotically
uh enhanced or retrieved explanations or
or or memories uh it does seem they do
seem to be genuine physical face-to-face
encounters with non-human entities. uh
the question I have asked myself not
what is it and why is it happening
because I don't think there's any answer
to that is is this fact uh the fact that
this has been part of my life and I
haven't mentioned that apparently it
happened to me at least once as a child
there is some evidence that I had an
experience as a child is what I've done
uh in terms of my research in terms of
trying to get to the bottom of the
military cases is that something I'm
doing um subconsciously because of this
other aspect in my life or you know is
there a prosaic reason for it? Uh is
there an outside e influence? In fact,
I've considered you know is somebody
influencing me to do what I'm doing. I
have no answers to that. It may be
totally offthe-wall to think that but
you know the questions go through your
mind when these things have happened
again and again. Um, let me briefly say
that in uh December of 2014,
uh, I awoke in my home here in Colorado
and found a a short entity standing at
the foot of my bed. I was awake. I was
not dreaming. And, uh, I was about to
scream. And before I could do that, uh,
what seemed like the next instant, it
was bright sunshine flooding through the
windows. And several hours had obviously
passed. Now, that's been almost 10
years, and nothing has happened to me
for the last 10 years.
uh knockwood. So, you know, it is what
it is. I don't know most of what it's
about. Um but I know it's physically
real and it is occurring.
>> Now, I know Bob Jacobs when I spoke to
him about this, he told me he had woken
up after these events with marks on his
body. And I recall one photograph he
sent me of it almost looks like a tattoo
on his on his body on his skin of little
dots
>> about eight or nine dots in a square
shape. Have you ever had that kind of
experience after
>> I I have looked uh again and again. I if
if it's anything like that on my body
after any of these experiences, it's
very subtle. I I haven't noticed
anything. I have found blood on my
pillow on at least two occasions that I
can recall and uh could not find any
evidence of uh a cut on my face or
insect bite or anything that would have
been a source of the blood. Um so I have
had that on two occasions. Um let me
briefly add as I mentioned in the book
Bob and I mentioned I forget the year I
think it was 2018. I found blood for the
second time on the sheet right under my
chin and again it was clearly a spot of
blood and I texted Bob real quickly and
he went and checked his bed and he had
found I forget the the time difference
but he had found blood on his pillow
virtually at the same time that I found
blood on mine um which I find pretty
interesting.
>> Tell me about the tripledigit
thingy Bob. Um
this sounds very strange but but it's
enough enough experiencers have reported
it. It's a real phenomenon. Um after my
first abduction uh in 1988 as an adult
at least um I began having nightmares uh
about uh what seemed to be the abduction
itself. On each occasion when I woke up
in bathed in sweat and scared to death,
it was 4:44 according to my digital
clock. And that happened more than once.
And I learned by reading the literature
that other experiencers in particular a
man named Ray Fowler who was a leading
researcher. Uh he's actually the first
person that talked about UFOs shutting
down nuclear missiles. He worked for a
company Sylvania in the 60s that was one
of the Minuteman contractors. He had
contacts at Malmstrom. He learned that
these objects were hovering over the
missiles and the missiles were going
haywire. uh Ray Fowler, I think in
probably the early 70s, went public uh
and said, "I'm an abductee." And he
started describing all of the
experiences he had had. And what he said
and has repeatedly said is after his
nightmares about alien abduction, he
wakes up at these tripledigit times uh
333, 444, 555.
And I now know from my communications
with other uh abductees around the
world, many many people are experiencing
this. What it is, why why it occurs, we
don't know. But I have a chapter in in
Bob and my book uh called the triple
digit thingy in which we describe the
phenomenon. Is it a hint? Is it a tease?
Uh is it just sort of, you know, secret
handshake? Somebody's telling you, you
know, these experiences are real and you
know, we're going to kind of hint that
they are. We don't know. No one knows, I
don't think, but it's real.
>> Have you ever in the period when you've
been engaging with these NHI, you know,
in these weird abduction encounters,
have you ever tried to communicate with
them?
>> Um, just speaking for myself, um, my
memories of the actual encounters are so
fragmentaryary. I have no memories of
that. What I have memories of uh again
both consciously recalled and sometimes
under hypnosis is I they're in control.
They're not telling me anything. They're
just moving me around and doing things
to me. Um but unlike some uh people who
are very responsive to the hypnotic
recall technique who can remember a very
sequential kind of narrative this
happened then that happened then then
that happened. I don't have that uh
fortunately or unfortunately and I just
have these glimpses of basically being
manhandled and uh they're in control.
I'm not. Uh the entities that I see in
in all of my uh experiences are in fact
what we are commonly calling grays. Uh
about four feet tall, large bald
cranium, big black eyes. Um, and I do
have these uh more than on more than one
occasion what seems to be genuine
telepathic communication. They don't
speak with their lips.
>> Do you feel any sense of malevolence
from them?
>> Uh, I get a sense of business-like
activity. They're they're they've got
something to do. They're going to do it.
Your wishes or desires or fears aren't
of concern to them. They're just doing
what they're there to do. and to get it
done. That's kind of a very cold uh
sense that I get from them. Yeah.
>> I I can imagine that during these
encounters, you're terrified. Are you?
>> Um yes, quite clearly. And um again,
when when I'm uh hypnotically addressed,
I'm just utterly terrified. My entire
body is is quaking with fear. Um, and
uh, when I have conscious recall, the
the last experience that I described in
2014 where I sat up off my pillow, my
lifted my head off my pillow and saw
this entity standing at the foot of my
bed. Uh, I was about to scream. I was
just terrified because I knew something
was going to happen. So, yeah, the the
overwhelming almost the only sense is
just utter utter fear and terror.
Now let's sit back for a moment and
accept. Okay, let's just accept even
though it's it's a big ask. I mean
obviously the debunkers would say this
is all hallucination. It's all hypnotic
suggestion. But let's say we accept that
you have encountered an entity in your
bedroom that you have been abducted by
non-human intelligences.
Why not be more overt? What what can you
speculate about what their possible game
plan might be for doing such a thing?
Um,
you know, I I just don't know that I
have any special insight even though I'm
I'm subject to the these encounters. Um,
I've read what everyone talks about
online, you know, and and in books, you
know, various opinions and theories
about what they're up to. Um, I have a
good friend named Steve uh Aspen who's a
Brit. Uh, he's a lifelong abductee. In
fact, he's a fourth generation abductee.
He's written an excellent book called
Out of Time, which I highly recommend in
which he talks about his experiences. uh
he believes as do other people who've
researched this subject that these
reports of a hybrid program whereby
these entities are actually uh
retrieving sperm and ova from humans and
using it in some way that involves
genetic I wouldn't say experimentation
but some sort of genetic program uh that
is combining our DNA with their DNA. He
believes that's what's going on. I've
read reports about that, of course. Um I
have no in all of my experiences, I have
no uh explicit ex memory of sperm being
taken, for example. So whether they've
done that to me or not, I I have no
memory of it. Uh so I think that's
probably a leading, you know, candidate
for trying to explain um what might be
going on with the abduction experiences.
I would also say getting back to the
government coverup, uh, if in fact some
government decides to go public with
this and tell the world that this is
real, that we have visitors from from
elsewhere, you're not going to be
hearing about the abduction experiences
from a government source for any time in
the near future. Uh, like the nuclear
weapons cases, that's something it's,
you know, you're just not going to talk
about right away, if ever.
um how how do you break it to your
citizens that these entities have the
ability to come into your home and take
you out uh and take you somewhere and do
things to you against your will? That's
not something that any government is
going to voluntarily admit to people.
So Bob, in the spring of 2023, you
actually showed some initiative and
brought several US Air Force veterans to
Arrow to the Pentagon's UFO
investigation office to give their
testimony. And these were people that
you'd interviewed over the years about
their UFO encounters in Air Force ICBM
fields operated in various parts of
America. What happened?
um he's given me permission to to
identify him now. Um
a a man named Kirk McConnell who uh was
an investigator for the Senate Armed
Services Committee approached me in
January of 23 and said, "I've been in
touch with Arrow.
um people at Arrow, I believe he said
Sean Kirkpatre in particular is asking
me to ask you whether you would approach
the veterans that you're still in touch
with uh to see whether any of them would
be willing to talk to Arrow. So I sent
out a group email and I think I got
ultimately 11 confirmations from people
including Bob Salace um and some other
people and uh they set up appointments.
They spoke with Arrow, somebody from
Arrow, and at the time they they were
all very positive about their their
experience. They were treated cordially.
Uh they were basically allowed to tell
their story without interruption or
without a lot of contradictory push
back. And so for the first time, having
had these experiences decades ago out in
the missile field, uh to be able to
present that information, you know,
openly to a representative of the US
military, uh the gentlemen that I that
they spoke with were were military. I'm
not going to identify them. Uh but they
were members of Arrow and uh they felt
it was a good thing and they said so to
me in emails. However, I think it was in
April of 2023 when Sean Kirkpatrick went
before Senator Gillibrand had a
committee hearing about Arrow and said
unequivocally that no information
presented to Arrow up to that point
indicated any evidence of an
extraterrestrial involvement. Um, all of
my sources became very angry and
indignant and said, you know, we're
talking about things going on in the 60s
and 70s involving craft that don't even
exist today in in our arsenal or this
the Russians arsenal. Clearly, they had
to be from somewhere else, some other uh
entities. And so, they felt betrayed.
They felt as if uh they had been used
and they're uniformly angry uh about
their experiences with Arrow. Um, so I
actually told them in the group email
initially, I said, "Look, uh, I think
you need to do this. I think you need to
talk to Arrow." However, my opinion is
that it is a front organization. They're
not serious about investigating. They're
probably a front for CIA or somebody
like that. And don't be surprised, you
know, if nothing comes from this. But I
could be wrong, guys, you know, and
miracles sometimes happen. So, I think
you really need to speak to Arrow. And I
think it was 11 of them did ultimately,
but once all that happened, uh, they
felt uniformly betrayed. Uh, a couple of
them mentioned to me they learned that
the interviews with the Arrow
representative weren't even being
recorded. Uh, and if you're going to
have a serious investigation and take
witness testimony, you need to record
what's being said. And Arrow wasn't even
taking it seriously enough to even
record their testimony. Robert Hastings,
you've spent nearly 60 years of your
life intrigued with and investigating
the UAP mystery.
Are we going to take another 60 plus
years before we get an answer as to what
it is?
>> I I hope not. Um, you know, I I don't
think it's going to happen tomorrow. I
think it's just a question of time
before it will happen, meaning an
official announcement of the reality of
all of this. Um, but I don't think it's
going to happen, you know, in the next
few months. Um, whistleblowers are
coming forward and talking about some
dramatic things. And so, who knows? The
dam may break suddenly, but I'm
cautiously optimistic. It won't be
another 60 years. It's not going to even
be another five years. I don't think I
think uh not only Americans and
Australians but people all over the
world are going to know the facts in the
relatively near term.
Well, Robert, I hope you and I live to
see that day. Robert, if people want to
get in touch with you, if there's a
whistleblower with some dark secret
about a nuclear missile facility and
UFOs they'd like to pass on to you or to
me by the way, um how do they get in
touch with you? Uh, I'll just give them
my email address, which is
ufohastingsaol.com.
And if anyone approaches me claiming to
be a military veteran and having had an
experience involving UFOs, the first
thing I'm going to ask that person is to
provide their DD214
to confirm that they were indeed at the
base and in the squadron they said they
were. And if they're willing to do that,
uh, either, you know, tell me something
off the record or hopefully something
for publication, I'm very eager to hear
from those persons.
And just to repeat, too, I really do
strongly recommend this wonderful tome,
UFOs and nukes, extraordinary encounters
at nuclear weapons sites, which is
Robert's definitive book on this
subject. He's also done the documentary
uh UFOs and Nukes, the secret link
revealed. And the book Encounters that
we talked about is entitled um
Confession, our hidden alien encounters
revealed. And it's co-authored by both
Robert and Dr. Bob Jacobs. Robert
Hastings, it's been an honor, sir. I
could talk to you all day, but I can see
both of us are going to flag if we keep
on going much longer. Thank you so much
for speaking to me today.
>> Thank you, Ross. uh you've been very
supportive of my work over the years. I
greatly appreciate it.
>> It's a pleasure.
