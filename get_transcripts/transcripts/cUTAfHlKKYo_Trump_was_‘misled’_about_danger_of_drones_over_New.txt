Hundreds of these mystery drones seen up
and down the east coast, specifically
over military bases. This was before
President Trump was sworn into office.
His team then came out saying the drones
were authorized to be flown by the FAA.
But Ross, I have to ask you, was that
answer satisfactory? And what do you
hope to get from this hearing today?
I'm afraid it wasn't satisfactory and a
lot of people are looking to the
president to get a better briefing
because whoever told him that these were
FAA authorized drones being used for
research and other purposes misled the
president. And I think that's quite
shameful.
