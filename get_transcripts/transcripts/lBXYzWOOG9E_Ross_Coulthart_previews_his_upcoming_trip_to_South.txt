Yes, I am going to Peru, Bolivia, and
Easter Island in about three or four
weeks. Really excited to do that. I host
tours occasionally. I was in Egypt last
year. And yes, I will be bringing you
whatever I can from Bolivia, Peru, and
Easter Island on the megalithic
mysteries there, including I hope on a
story related to the tridactyls. I've
been in touch with Tierry Yamin, who's
one of the more prominent investigators
into this issue. And yes, I do hope to
bring you something on this.
