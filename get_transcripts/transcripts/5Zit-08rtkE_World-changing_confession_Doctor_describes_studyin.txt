Good day and welcome back to Reality
Check. I'm your host, Ross Kulart, and
today it's my honor to bring to Reality
Check for the very first time the
filmmaker who has probably done more
than anyone else to elevate public
awareness of the legitimacy of UFOs,
UAPs, as an authentic mystery worthy of
intense investigation.
Filmmaker James Fox is an English-born
American filmmaker whose first UFO
documentary was made nearly 30 years
ago. He's done Out of the Blue, I know
what I saw, The Phenomenon, Moment of
Contact, and The Program. That's his
most recent one. They are brilliant,
credible, factually driven presentations
that stand out because they dared to
take the UAP subject seriously. Now,
it's James's 2022 film, Moment of
Contact, that brings him back here
today. That film is James' investigation
into the 1996
Virginia
UAP incident, often called the Roswell
of Brazil. Now, James has just finished
updating that film with major new
evidence. I'm very excited to bring this
to you today. He has explosive new
details that we are going to tell you
about today for the very first time.
I caught up with James at Contact in the
Desert way back in May and he whispered
in my ear over a coffee about what he
had in this film update and boy I've
been waiting for months. He he called me
literally yesterday and said, "I've got
it. I'm ready to go." And I'm so excited
that he's asked us to help lead art this
film because it's very exciting what
he's got.
James has obtained an exclusive
interview with a neurosurgeon
who says he quite literally touched and
telepathically communicated with what he
testifies on the record to James was a
live alien being held in captivity by
Brazilians and then apparently handed
over to the US military.
James, I'm very excited to bring you
here to Reality Check. Welcome, sir.
Maybe we could start off by giving us a
bit of a summary of what the Virginia
case was all about.
>> Thank you so much for having me on,
Ross. I I really appreciate it. And I
don't know if that was deserved intro,
but I appreciate it very much. So, so
thank you. Um, well, let's see how far
back I can go here. Um, I was making my
second UFO film in the late 90s out of
the blue with a partner. It was probably
circa 1999. And uh, remind your
audience, I was making my second
documentary on UFOs.
And we were mapping out the film and we
were going to cover Bentwaters and the
Phoenix Lights and and a various other
cases around the world. and and my
partner at the time who was a former BBC
correspondent, Tim Coleman, he said,
"Oh, mate, we got to we got to get this,
you know, Brazilian case, you know, it
was absolutely unbelievable. These
aliens walking around in the live, you
know, and I thought, h I picked the
wrong partner for this film. This guy's
out of his mind. Like there's no way
that happened." So, I just want like
everyone to understand like that's how I
was introduced to this case. Fast
forward over 10 years.
I am God, more than 10 years. Yeah,
probably. In any case, I'm invited to
Brazil on a separate account. I just
finished a film called uh I Know What I
Saw, which is a 2-hour special for the
History Channel. And um I get invited to
give a presentation in Brazil in a place
called Perui, which is sort of the south
of Sao Paulo. And Stanton Freeman is
there. I love Stanton Freeman and I
respect him tremendously. He's the guy
that, you know, thanks to him and a
handful of others, we know about
Roswell. So, I'm there with Stanton and
and I'll back up a second. Right before
I left, there was a very good friend of
mine who was very high up in the
entertainment industry, Jeff Saganski.
I'll use his name. He's fine with that.
And he said, "Oh, James, you're you're
going to uh you're going to Brazil. You
have to look into that Varia case." And
I was, "Oh, God, not this, please." But
I had a lot of respect for him. And I
said, "Jeff, yeah, sure. I'll I'll look
into that for you." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I'll definitely do that. Click. And I
said to myself, I'm not wasting one
second on this case. So, I fly to Brazil
and I'm there at this conference with
Stanton Freriedman and the topic came
up. I think there was like a witness
there or something. And Stanton looked
at me and he said, "Oh, James, yeah, you
don't know about the Virginia case." And
I said, "Well, I know about it, but live
aliens walking around in town like
please." He goes, "Not so fast. you
know, there's a lot of very compelling
firsthand testimony.
So, that was the impetus for me to say,
"Okay, let me have a look. Let me let me
poke around a little bit." And so, the
more I looked, the more I found, and
here we are 16 years later. And uh we've
got the most compelling, in my humble
opinion, firsthand eyewitness testimony
the world's ever seen. And if you if
Yeah, sorry. Go ahead. No, I was going
to say, so to kick off the events, would
it be fair to say that probably the
defining event that kicked this all off
is the testimony of a pilot, Carlos
Duza, 13th of January, 1996,
and he spots a cigar- shaped object
about the size of a school bus emitting
smoke, losing altitude over Virginia,
and he follows it to a field. What
happens, James?
>> So, he was very early in the morning. He
was an ultralight pilot. He was a
history professor in Sa Paulo. Uh Carlos
Dosoza and he sees what this strange
looking perhaps it was a prototype. He
didn't know it was a cigar- shaped
aluminum, you know, colored very early
in the morning and it was clearly in
distress. It had a big gash on the side.
It had a vapor type smoke coming out the
back. Not typical smoke. It was like
more like a vapor. And he thought, "My
gosh, that looks like it's going down."
And um he was right near what's called
the Mayolini farm which is roughly 10 12
miles outside as the crow flies from
Vargia. And um he drives off this
freeway and he follows this dirt road up
to what he describes as an impact site.
He said he saw this thing struggling to
stay in the air. It impacts the ground.
Half of it stays somewhat intact and
there's rest of debris over a very large
area larger than a football field. And
does he see the craft crashed on the
ground?
>> Yeah, he sees it go down into the ground
and then he lost sight of it, but he saw
it go down and crash. Yes.
>> And when he when he gets to that
location, what happens? Can he get onto
the site?
>> Yes. So, he arrives he arrives at the
site with his car. He gets out of the
car and he sees this. He said the smell
was just so horrendous that he grabbed
his t-shirt and he put it up over his
mouth. It was like sulfur, like uh
ammonia. eyes watering,
>> very very strong. He said it was so
strong he could barely like tolerate it.
>> And then he saw these lots of like
little bits of aluminum. There was one
piece of the craft that was intact that
was about half of it, about half the
size of a large school bus. And and lots
of bits of debris of various sizes. And
he said he picked one of the pieces up
and he said it was as light as a
feather. You you couldn't really feel it
in your hands. And he crumpled it up.
And when he opened his hands, it took
the shape back up again.
>> Just like Roswell.
>> Just like Roswell. And so he was just
but he wasn't thinking alien. He he
really didn't know what he was looking
at. And then the military trucks rolled
in from the military base as a from the
exact opposite direction that he
arrived.
>> So he's absolutely categorical that the
Brazilian military intervened, took over
a site where what appears to have been
an alien spacecraft has crashed. Does he
does he see a body? Does he see any live
beings?
>> Nope. He didn't see any body. I did ask
him. I said, "Was the remaining part of
the craft large enough for beans?" He
said, "Yes, but I didn't see any beans."
>> And do the military take the piece of
metal that he picked up off him? Do they
allow him to
>> Oh, yeah. They they came and gun I mean
they were telling him to leave to leave
to leave to leave and then he was like,
"I'm just, you know, try to help." And
they took out their rifles and they
threatened him. That's at that point he
didn't he didn't have the peace anymore.
He got back in his car and left.
>> Were there any American soldiers with
the Brazilian military in that
intervention?
>> Not that he said no.
>> So you've got an obvious crash. I I
guess in the sequence of events, the
next event that that has always
intrigued me, by the way, I I've I've
got to show my personal interest in the
Virginia case, James, and this is your
fault. [laughter]
I I I I I've got a little uh a little
alien being from Virginia.
>> Oh my gosh.
>> That a guy that a guy from the United
Kingdom who makes models. [laughter]
>> Oh, you've got one as well, I suspect.
[laughter]
>> Okay. I I wasn't going to share this,
but I [laughter] one too.
[gasps]
>> Okay.
>> We have somebody coming. No, I've had
this in front of my audience now for
months and nobody's picked up on it. So,
I thought it was time to reveal to the
audience that I have an alien being in
my set. So, [laughter]
>> that's that's that's that's really
funny. Yeah, that's really great. But,
let me
>> can I can I just I'm just interested in
the sequence because I've always been
struck. You've got that crash about 10
miles out of town and then as I
understand it on the morning of January
the 20th, there's a couple who report
seeing a damaged craft which presumably
is another different craft flying low
over the city of Virginia.
>> No. No. Okay. So that's we made that
much clear in this cut of the film and
we also have uh footage that we've put
together of of of such a craft. I know
this is hard to to to grasp and to wrap
your mind around, but if the
claims are true and the witnesses are to
be believed, what we were seeing with
the craft over Varia was a was a rescue
operation
>> by humans.
>> Yes. Because they all said, and I had a
hard time believing, but I interviewed a
lot of people and they said it was
looking for something. I said, "How do
you know it was looking for something?"
because it was doing a grid search slow
and low and methodical going over
stopping back and forth for for like a
long time.
>> So it wasn't a damaged craft at all. It
was a craft that was that was looking
for its comrades.
>> No, there were So there were now we have
new witnesses on the on the cigar-
shaped craft. We have the two farmers,
Enrico
um I'll think of her last name in a
second. They both saw the same thing
that Carlos described, a cigar- shaped
craft with vapor coming out the back
early in the morning, maybe two o'clock
in the morning, something like this. We
actually got a map and we figured out,
okay, we have a sighting. We have we
have Vargia here. We have the farmers
that see the craft here. We have another
witness that sees the craft over here
and it crashes and it ultimately crashes
right in the middle. It actually makes a
lot more sense now that we have that.
So, we have new witnesses where he was
in his farm. We we shot there and he
said he heard something very strange in
the sky and he looked out the window and
he saw this big cigar- shaped craft
making a weird noise like it was in
trouble and it landed on his farm and
that was so we have that testimony now
as well.
>> Right. And so that's a completely
different craft cuz that's the thing I
could never understand. How could the
craft have crashed in on the 13th of
January and then a week later people are
saying they've seen the craft again?
>> We don't know. No. So yeah, the craft
that that people have described was a
discshaped craft that we're doing as a
grid search operation. Everybody talks
about that. The the monument over
Brazil, sorry, over Virginia up at is a
big discshaped craft. That's the craft
that people saw that was methodically
looking. And I specifically asked all
these witnesses, how do you know it was
looking for something? They said it was
low and it was going out, coming back,
stopping, going out, coming back,
stopping. It was clearly looking for
something. And we really make that
distinction this time in the craft
because it's like, wow, that's that's
crazy, you know.
>> Do you have any intelligence, James, on
how the the the craft that did crash,
the cigar- shaped craft on the 30th of
January, 1996? Is there any evidence to
suggest that it was attacked by us
humans? as we now know is the case that
the US apparently has been using high
pulse microwave weapons and indeed in
some cases artillery to try and bring
down these craft. I I've thought about
this for a long time, a long time, well
over a decade. And I'm thinking to
myself, all these witnesses described
this craft as having this gash in the
back struggling to remain in the air and
and smoke. So it collided something
collided with it. Okay. Was it a meteor?
Was it uh an asteroid or I don't know
something? I mean, it collided with
something. Something hit it. So, your
guess is as good as mine. I know that
there have been orders over the decades
of shoot first, ask questions later.
Would it surprise me? It It wouldn't
surprise me, but I don't know because I
don't I you know, the case goes somewhat
cold once gets on the American side. But
the Americans apparently, according to
the Brazilians, knew it was coming.
Yeah, they'll get to that. I'll get to
that. So, in terms of our chronology,
I'm trying to keep you to a good
chronology. On the afternoon of January
the 20th, 1996, around 100 p.m., three
young women, sisters, Lillian, 14 years
old, Valkaria,
>> Valkyia,
>> Valkyia, who's 16,
>> and Katya who's 22.
>> They encounter something. What do they
see? So I my understanding it was about
3:00 in the afternoon and uh it was a
very hot day because January is summer
and uh they were uh taking a shortcut
through like a little it was a it was an
area of Venia that was being developed.
There were some construction sites and
there was a cinder block wall and a
little gate and they could go through
this field and kind of cut across as a
little shortcut and all three of them
were walking together and um one of them
said they saw like uh like some graffiti
on the cinder block wall which caught
their attention and they're looking at
this graffiti and then they see what
looks like maybe a statue or something
slouched up against the cinder block
wall. They're looking at it. They're
getting closer and closer.
Got within 10, 12 feet of it, again in
broad daylight, all three of them. And
this little creature that looked like it
was feeble and suffering went from a
crouch position, staring ahead to
turning and looking them right in the
eyes. And that sent one of the girls, I
think it was uh uh Valkyia and her
sister uh Lilani running freaked out
like scream. She said she screamed and
ran and left Katya.
So Katya is locked eyes on this creature
and she's having telepathic
communication with it. And Lilani and
her Liliani who I think was was uh 16
and and uh Vyuria was probably 14.
Lilani realizes Katya is still back
there. I got to go back. And they didn't
know what that she didn't know what it
was. She left her sister and went ran
back to get Katya. She was just locked
eyes on this thing. And it was basically
telling I need help. It was feeble. It
was scared. It needed help. And um she
grabbed Katya by the hand and yanked her
out of there. Um and and and off they
went and that exploded in the headlines.
>> Now that's a correct me if I'm wrong
here. It's four to five feet tall. It's
a hairless creature with oily brown
skin.
>> Yes.
>> And and crucially it it had three head
bumps which
>> Yeah. It had like little little lumps.
Three of them. Yes.
>> So that that's pretty much what
>> that's pretty much what they saw. And
it's squatting like that, looking
directly at that young girl.
>> Now, you've interviewed you've
interviewed the young girls, haven't
you?
>> Mult multiple times. Multiple times.
>> And they're adamant that this is what
they saw.
>> No. No. Absolutely. No question. They
worked with a woman named Betto
Rodriguez who who is a uh artist and and
and they got together with her and they
created that inf now infamous poster of
of the drawing of of the creature. and
they said it was is exactly what it
looks like.
>> Cuz I I noticed that in the official
debunk of the whole Vaginia case,
there's a a claim made by the military
in the Brazilian government that it was
likely a a homeless man named Madinho
who was who was known for crouching in
the area due to a mental disability.
>> What What do you say to that assertion?
>> I've seen him. He's he's a known
character in the town. you. He's still
there. Like I just saw him just a month
ago and everybody knows who he is. Like
he was like, you know, he was a pillar.
Everybody knows Medino. It's like it was
just so laughable.
>> Yeah. It was It's absolute. Yeah. So,
with with some certainty, you've got
triple corroboration there from the
three young girls, now women, and
they're adamant that what they saw was
clearly some kind of alien being, not a
local homeless man.
>> 1,000%.
1,000%. I mean, they just they just
cringe when you know, you hear that. And
the the girls are saying like they don't
know exactly what they saw, but they
said it wasn't a human and it wasn't an
animal and it had telepathic
communication through the eyes. It was
it was not something of this earth. It's
like, you know. Yeah. The thing I find
fascinating, James, is a [clears throat]
lot of folk mythology talks about the
devil. And isn't it interesting that
they describe an oagynous figure that
that essentially could pass for devilike
from our
>> uh mythology. And and it it's
interesting because the story gets
thicker, more intense. Later that day,
there's a police officer, Marco Elie
Chariz,
>> a young police officer. He he actually
reportedly captures a similar creature
>> just a couple blocks away. Couple blocks
away. A couple hours later, just a
couple blocks away.
>> Is it the same creature?
>> It one would only assume that it had to
be. It was like two blocks away. Two
couple hours later.
>> What does he do with it?
>> So So So it's interesting because Marco
Shrezy was military officer and Eric
Lopes, also another military officer.
They're both friends. Marco apparently
was off for the night and they get this
sort of he gets an APB that hey there's
something out something really unusual
out lingering to go capture whatever
this thing is. They didn't say it was an
ET or something very unusual. So those
were the orders given to to Eric Lopes.
Eric calls up his buddy who is off the
night. He says, "Hey, you want to join
me? I've got this crazy mission of
looking, you know." So Mark Marco Shre
jumps in the car with him and off they
go. And uh they actually see this
creature two blocks from where the girls
encountered it just a couple hours later
running across the road. So Marco Shares
without a moment's hesitation just jumps
out of the car and goes and grabs it.
And in the process of grabbing it and it
didn't put up much of a fight. It was
pretty feeble and he put it in the back
of the car and he got a little scratch
under his arm and he had some weird oil
on his skin. They go to one little tiny
hospital. It was more like a clinic and
the doctor apparently came out and took
one look at and said, "Uh uh, I don't
know what that is, but you're not
bringing it here." So then they go off
to regional hospital and they drop it
off at Regional Hospital. So
yeah, sorry.
>> No, that's good. So you set this up
perfectly now. Is is this where Dr.
Italo Ventureli comes across to being?
>> Exactly. Yes. Yep. So we had up until
this point we had testimony from a
military officer who we found that he
took a creature from Humanitas Hospital
because it went from the first little
clinic didn't get out of the car then it
went to regional got out of the car was
delivered taken indoor in fact I was
just at regional hospital like two weeks
ago and I went to the front desk the the
main entry point and I said hey you know
this incident and they got a big plaque
out front. This is where an ET came.
It's all right out in the open. Nobody's
hiding the story. And I asked the the
people at the desks coming into the to
the ER. Hey, have you guys heard? Oh,
yeah. One of the people that was there
that night still working here now.
>> And they said the creature. No, I'm not
kidding you. I swear to you. And they
said they got a big plaque outside. I
can I can share you a picture of it
talking about the events, but they took
the ET in the back entrance. They said
they did not come in the front. They
took it in the back.
>> Did the person you spoke to, aside from
Dr. Alo, did they also see the alien
being?
>> Good question. We were we we only had 24
more hours for flying home. We we got
the details. We got the the contact
information of that individual that was
there that night. Don't know. Didn't
have a chance to talk to them. I don't
know if they
>> That's what I love about this, James, is
you you've been coming and going from
this v this city now for years and each
time you go back, you get more layers of
factual information that corroborate
what you originally uncovered. You got
to hear like so now so now we have for
the first time ever because we have this
military police officer who we got to
come forward and he drove a creature
from Humanitas to Eza military base and
then Eza Campinas and that's when the
Americans came in right so um now for
the first time ever we have firthand
eyewitness testimony
from the lead neurosurgeon
still at the hospital who describes
face-to-face contact with the live alien
for 4 minutes. It's incredible.
>> At this point, James, with your
permission, we're going to roll the the
little sizzle grab you've given us from
Dr. Italo Venturelli. Here's Dr. Italo.
Fore! Foreign! Foreign!
for
speech.
What I love James about Dr. Italo is
he's very open about the fact that this
being touched him. He seems quite
emotional about the experience.
So, okay, I'll tell you how this came
about because it's extraordinary what
happened.
We knew we knew that the live alien was
at regional hospital. We have people
that we are in touch with over more than
a decade that work at both hospitals
that we meet privately with. Every time
we go to Virginia, it's always quiet,
off the record. They come and there are
certain secrets they talk about during
surgery and only during surgery. So we
knew and from other testimony that that
creature was it so the other
neurosurgeon who was on duty that night
was his
sort of protege. It was Dr. Italo and
Dr. Marcos Vinesis. Dr. Marco Vinesis
did a little procedure on the creature.
Apparently it was had some damage, some
swelling, something happened. did a
little procedure on the creature and uh
I don't want to go into too much detail
because it's it's an ongoing thing. Uh
and then he had a heart attack and died
in 2018. Okay. So now he's So now he's
gone and his partner who's the lead
neurosurgeon, Dr. Italo himself had a
heart attack just a few months ago and
he's in the ICU
staring at the ceiling thinking that he
was going to die. and he thought,
"I can't believe I'm taking this to the
grave. I this is not right. If I survive
this, I'm going public." And then
>> Yep. And and so he said, "I'm doing this
for my grandchildren and I don't care
what the consequences are. I don't
care."
>> That's what he said.
>> Such a raw act of courage. Those are the
kind of whistleblowers we need, James.
And full credit to you.
>> Full credit to you for persuading him to
speak to you about it. I I just take my
hat off to witnesses like Dr. Italo
Venturelli for having the courage to
come forward. Was he threatened not to
speak?
>> Oh, yeah. So, so what happened was and
and I want to send a shout out to Alini
Crass who's our lead translator and one
of our co-producers. She has a very
disarming presence and she calmed him
and he snuck us into the back of the
hospital. Snuck us in and we're going,
"What? What's happening? What's going
on?" kind of sneaks us into the ICU
exactly where it happened. We we get
masked up because you can't be in the
ICU without it. So, we get all of our
masks on. I don't know where this is
going. And all of a sudden, he just
starts telling all and uh and it was
extraordinary. And then the the the the
hospital staff caught us filming and
what are you doing in here? You're not
supposed to be fil. Nobody has any
permits. Nobody, you know. So, they kick
so they kick us out, but we've gotten
the we gotten the goods. And he's like,
I think I just lost my job. And so, they
kick us all out. So, we leave the
hospital and we go into a c. We didn't
know where we're going. We just went
into a cafe next door and we're filming
at this cafe. We're all like magically
crying. And I asked him how it felt
after 29 years to come forward. What it
was like, what it was like to look into
the eyes of this creature. Tell me what
it was like. I WAS DYING to know. And he
said it was a higher level of
intelligence. So much higher, more
advanced. Even though that it was in
captivity, it had control of the room
way. He said an intelligence way beyond
it was like an angel. But he describes
his skin as more white with the big red
eyes and the little horns exactly the
way the girls described. And I just
thought to myself, was that sort of a
defense measure? Did their skin react to
the hot sun?
>> Do they when they're when they're scared
and freed? I don't know. I I don't know.
>> So is this particular being damaged? Are
they injured? The
>> Yes. every being that I might and here's
an interesting thing is is that I
remember when I was first going to
include a whole scene from varia in the
phenomenon right so I was covering like
Rua and Sakuro and uh and a number of
other cases in the United States and I
was covering Varia
and Dr. uh Roger Lear was adamant it was
like 2012 maybe 2013 and Dr. Roger Leer
was just adamant about getting on
camera. But at the time I had just
flown, we rented this h this this
filming space in Los Angeles and we had
all these witnesses coming in from
different corners of the world about the
Africa case Rua Zimbabwe for the 20th
anniversary. Bringing those guys
together and I was hyperfocused on that.
I was dealing with Kenneth, Kenneth
Arnold's daughter, Kim Arnold, getting
her to go on camera for the first time,
revealing all these incredible things
about his experience. And then Roger and
I was back burner varia for the time
because I had my hands full. Like was
working 17our days. And Roger Lear kind
of got upset and he says, "Well, if
you're not going to, you know, if you're
not going to film me, at least take my
tapes." And so he gave me his tapes and
then I digitized them and I don't know
what the exact time span was, but I gave
them back to him and then he died.
So fast forward when I was producing the
when I was because I ended up deleting
all of the scenes from Vargia. I mean it
was a very painful day out of the
phenomenon because I just couldn't
squeeze it in. It was too much too
complicated. Too complicated. We were
still missing critical testimony. We
couldn't find Sa like a number of other
people. I said, "Okay, I'm going to make
a movie on this case alone. The heck
with the rest of it." And I deleted the
whole thing out of there. So fast
forward all these years later and I
thought, "Oh my gosh, I've got the Roger
Lear tapes." So, I went and found them
and then I bought his book and I'm
reading the book and I have this
incredible encounter and the tapes were
basically a transcript of the the book
was a transcript of the tapes because I
had the tapes. However, there was one
scene where he's in Humanitas Hospital
talking to doctors that worked on
another allegedly worked on another
alien and he gave this incredible
description of the of his interview with
these two doctors and that was at
Humanitas Hospital. But he talks about
communication with this with this
creature like high level communication.
It's phenomenal. So we're talking here
is this alien that you're talking about
that was at Humanitaras Hospital. Is
that a completely separate being from
the one that Dr. Italo is saying that he
was trying to treat?
>> I I I believe so, but I don't know for
sure. But I believe so. But the
implications are if this is all true and
correct that there are at least two
bodies of alien beings so-called
biologics in the possession now of what
we'll learn to be the US military or
intelligence community.
>> Yes. So, I just we also just interviewed
the former chief of police uh mean of u
the the area all around as a military
base and we've been trying to get him
for years and we would just show up at
his house. We just kept doing it year
after year after year and we finally got
him a couple months ago and he says
>> I see the guy where you turned up and he
was at a window on a a house that was
elevated above you guys looking up at it
and and you were really worried you were
going to get shot because he had a gun.
>> Oh yeah. No, no, he said I will shoot
you. That guy, that's a different guy. I
was P2 military police. But Pedro was
the former chief of police and it's like
we finally showed up at his house and we
were going over there maybe it was like
six o'clock and I we were all in a kind
of a hurry. We're trying to get continue
north to get up to Venia. We had a lot
of filming to do and I said, "Hey, let's
stop and get some pizza, you know, and
it was like, well, we got a job to do."
And I just I wanted to stop and get some
pizza. We met this great restaurant
owner, pizza, and we had pizza and we
had a little wine. We had a great
dinner, but it really like cost us a
good 90 minutes. And so we were showing
up at the former chief of police, Pedro
Auar,
uh a little later than we wanted to. As
it turns out, it was perfect because
when we arrived, he had just gotten home
10 or 15 minutes earlier. So it was
absolutely divine. Like it was perfect.
And we eventually got our way into his
house and then it's like, "Hey, you mind
if we take a couple pictures?" you know,
they got the camera in there and then we
got the audio going and then he g he's
like, "You know what?" And he gave us an
interview and he said that he heard that
there were three.
>> Wow.
>> That's what he heard. Yeah. And he was
he describes he saw one of them under a
tarp that was probably deceased. Um he
was at the military base, Eza. He
describes all the helicopters and all
the activity. He said he saw more brass
that day at Eza Military Base than he's
ever seen in his life. More brass. He
talked about the brass and so we got him
to go
>> senior officers basically.
>> Yeah. Yeah. And uh so we got the former
chief of police now for the first time
and
and the military officer Marco Sharice
who died a couple weeks after allegedly
handling this creature. He dies. Well,
the people that did the autopsy is IP I
think it's IPD. Two forensic
pathologists Dr. Janini and Dr. Armando
both went on the record for the first
time for us on camera just recently and
said, "I've never I did the autopsy. The
guy that did the tissue samples, Dr.
Janini, who founded the company, he
said, I've never seen bacteria behave in
the way that bacteria behaved. It's
never before and never since." So, just
to remind our audience, this is the
policeman, the military policeman who
got a scratch under his arm when he was
retrieving the body of or the alien, the
live alien and taking it to the hospital
that night in the original 20th of um
January incident. And he'd got that
scratch. It had become infected and
developed an abscess. And so, the
pathologists couldn't help him at all.
They couldn't treat him.
>> Well, so he was treated in a number and
I talked to another doctor who also
treated him just recently. He didn't go
on camera, but we met with him privately
and he said we threw the kitchen sink at
him and there's nothing we could do.
That bacteria was just the most
resilient bacteria they've ever seen.
Nothing reacted to it and it killed
them. Now, James, I just want at this
point because our audience may be sort
of reeling from the number of people
that you've cited here. There are
multiple corroborative witnesses. People
who saw craft, people who saw beings,
doctors, military police. How many of
these people do you think would be
willing to testify publicly to an
inquiry under oath?
[sighs and gasps]
>> All of them. And I I I'm uh okay. So I I
can't go into detail right now, but
let's just say that that uh I'm working
with uh certain individuals in the
government to make that happen.
I'm very excited to hear because I mean
I mean the thing that blows me away
about what you're revealing here and
there's much much more to come is you've
done layered quality investigative
journalism. This is not something that's
easily debunked. You have corroborative
multiple corroborative witnesses
supporting a consistent claim.
I have a neuro the head neurosurgeon of
that runs the entire department at
regional hospital today willing to take
a public lie detector test and testify
that everything he's saying is true and
then there are other doctors that we're
talking to now like we're in
>> Did he lose his job because you did the
interview or was it okay? It it it was
tumultuous, but he was so in demand that
it they couldn't like he's the lead guy,
so they they couldn't shoot themselves
in the foot. So, it's been rough, a bit
of a rough ride with him. But he said to
me, he goes, "James, I I don't care the
consequences. The world needs to know
this happened. This being that I
encountered communicated with me
telepathically. It was a highly advanced
intelligence, way more than anything
he's ever seen here on Earth. He called
it almost like an angel. And it was
despite the fact that it was in it sends
chills like despite the fact that it was
in captivity,
it had control of the room. Now, one
more thing I think you were asking me
about. So, he said it was because I
asked him, "How long did you spend? Did
you show the trailer of the film yet?"
>> We're going to show the trailer at the
very end. I'm going to tease the trailer
at the very end.
>> So, I asked him like, "How long did you
spend with this creature?" You know, I'm
I always want to like I want to
experience
the witnesses. I want so badly to be
there in the room with them and know
every detail. So, just like put me in
that room with the what did it feel
like, you know? And and I get all those
little just details. I want to hear it
all. And um he said after about four
minutes, he stepped out to do something
and the military burst in took the burst
in. I think exactly what he said. burst
in and took the bean and threatened
everyone with secrecy and then left.
>> So the bean's still alive at that point?
>> Yes, the bean was alive and the military
grabbed it and left.
>> And this is the Brazilian military.
There's no US officers with that
Brazilian military team.
>> There are others claiming, excuse me,
that they were in contact with
Americans, but that was later,
>> a little bit later.
>> And do we know where the being was taken
from the hospital where Dr. Italo had
attempted to treat it.
>> We we we unfortunately I I know that the
beans ended up at me at at Eza and
definitely Campinus, but I don't know.
And then of course we have the flight
control officer who said that the USAF,
which is the United States Air Force
flight, came in and it didn't have
authorization from the Brazilian
government to land. And a higher level
government official, Brazilian, walked
in and said, "Let the plane land." So,
we put out a foyer request for all air
flights in America that came into Brazil
from the 14th, I think it was the 13th
to the 27th or something like this. And
it took three years for our team to get
that response. And it would came back
from the CIA. And it's like basically
it's a national security issue. It's
classified. And you're your your your
request is denied.
>> So, let me get this very clear, James.
Normally aircraft movements like that
would be the subject of very little
controversy and they would be released.
>> One would imagine but what do I know?
All I know is I asked and I was told it
was like national it's in the film. You
you'll see it.
>> So So you know from a military source,
an air traffic controller that a plane a
US Air Force plane came into the ESA
military base
>> very very close to Vina. Uh they came to
Campenis.
>> Campenis. Where whereabouts is that
relevant relative to Virginia?
>> I would I show it on the map in there. I
I have to say it's to the south
maybe two hours, three hours south.
>> But we know Virginia.
>> Your witness told you that US military
helicopters were part of that
deployment. Is that correct?
>> Multiple military witnesses. Multiple
people. Yes. Yes. And even the chief of
police described those helicopters just
recently.
>> Can I ask you this? This is what I never
understand is I I appreciate that the
Brazilian government at the time and
probably now is very close to the US
military and the intelligence community.
And for a large period of time, the CIA
practically ran a lot of governments in
South America and Central America. But
why on earth would the Brazilian
government have allowed an American
retrieval team to fly in and take away
what is probably the first definitive
evidence of a non-human intelligence?
>> You know, I asked that very question to
uh I don't know if I should use his
name. It's a it's a name that you're
familiar with and he said because they
can.
>> Really? Yeah. That's what he said. Yeah,
we can do whatever we want
>> because the implications of this are
that the Brazilian military and
presumably other militaries around the
world are colluding with the US military
and covering this up.
>> I mean,
>> I was shocked. I was shocked when I
found out America was involved. I HAD NO
IDEA WHEN I STARTED THIS INVESTIGATION.
NONE.
>> I was Oh my god. And not only that,
>> they were there intimidating witnesses.
>> I have people on camera talking about
it. Yes. So the US the US was going
around intimidating witnesses.
>> Yes. You remember I there was a whole
family of witness I all Yeah. A whole
family of witnesses and you know they
saw the what if to take their account at
face value. Right. They lived right near
where the girls saw the creature and
where the capture occurred. There was a
discshaped object quietly and silently
and methodically maneuvering through the
neighborhood low. And they watched it.
He goes, "I watched it for 30 minutes."
The whole family did and they all talk
about it. And so, and then they said the
Americans came and they, you know, they
it's Americans with some Brazilians and
he said maybe NAZA. He wasn't sure if it
was NAZA. They didn't know, but he said
maybe Naza and they were told don't, you
know, this conversation never happened.
We were never here. There were other the
mother of the of the two girls got the
visit. That was like one of the first
times, you know, from men in suits and
uh she's like, I don't know if
definitively that it was two the
Americans, but they looked like
Americans and then one that had a strong
accent that spoke Portuguese.
>> Didn't they offer her money?
>> Offered her money to tell the girls to
go public on TV that they were lying and
they saw it was a dog or something
other. Yeah.
>> And the mother refused.
>> Did the girls ever retract the story?
>> Never.
>> Never.
>> Wow. And has the family suffered any
retribution from anyone as a result of
speaking out?
>> They said that they've been mocked and
laughed at yes for for decades. Nothing
to gain, everything to lose. This is not
a career enhancing, you know, thing,
especially back then.
>> So you've actually got US officials,
possibly not military, maybe
intelligence, gaslighting and
intimidating, bullying, threatening
people to try and stop them from talking
about what they saw.
No question. And and you know, that was
one of the first times where I really
went all in on reporting on these
so-called men in black or men in dark
suits. I know it's got a lot of baggage
that that term is used, but um I also
and this individual is going to have to
be completely nameless, unfortunately,
and I can't even use it, but this
individual claimed
on the behalf of someone that we've
heard of to fly into Brazil and get a
piece of that UFO and fly it back to the
United States. And this individual swore
to me up and down. He did. The
individual did it.
>> Yeah.
>> So he was part of the he was part of the
retrieval team.
>> I all I know is that on the behalf of
somebody that's pretty high up, he went
and he brought and he smuggled a piece
of an alleged UFO. Didn't say that it
was from that particular case, but the
timeline is would imply that it was of
that particular case. But I don't know.
But there's more stuff coming out. It's
going to continue to come out. That's
Yeah. I I just want to come back a
little bit, James, because it's quite
tragic the story of the military police
officer, Cherzi, who picked up the being
and tried to get it medical treatment.
>> Yes.
>> His family that they've got the the
records and you've mentioned that the
pathologists couldn't do anything for
him. What kind of bacteria did they say
it was? Was it known within human
bacterial understanding?
>> It was. So I I we have uh just as of
like a week or two ago, we got the full
report with comments of the autopsy and
we're in the process of having them
because our translator, it's very
technical, but it was a variant of a
particular bacteria that's never that
he's never in his life seen and he's
done thousands and thousands of
biopsies. He said it was a variant, like
it was an evolved bacteria that was
resilient and was doing things that he's
never seen do before. And
>> that's that that's important because one
of the debunks on the Cherzi case that's
been put out by the officials in the
Brazilian military and intelligence
community is that this bacteria was
nothing unusual, that it wasn't an
anomalous bacteria at all. You're you're
categorical that the pathology records
that you've newly obtained do verify
that this was an anomalous bacteria.
>> I have him on camera going into total
detail about it just recently looking
right at the camera. I'm the guy that
did the tissue samples. I'm the guy that
saw it. This is what I saw. I've done
thousands and thousands of biopsies
never before and never since. That's
right now.
>> I'm very excited to see this new film,
James. It sounds like you've nailed down
some great information. Can I ask you
also about Dr. Italo's telepathic
communications with the being? I don't
want to take away from what you reveal
in the film, but is there any more that
you can tell us about what the being
communicated to him? I said to him, I
said, um, because I'm very curious, you
know, when you looked in the eyes,
because I always, everybody always says
when you look in the eyes, that's when
it happens, you know, and so what
happened when you looked in the eyes?
Was there any kind of communication?
Yes. Yes. He said yes. And then he said
fala which is speaking speaking without
speaking which I thought was interesting
that it was calm. It was uh it was um uh
relaxed and calm and communicating that
that it was okay to him and and there
was and the way he described it and I
and I did another just a couple weeks
ago I did another full sitdown one and a
half hour extremely detailed interview
with him with every possible detail I
could possibly extract that I've yet to
um uh completely transcribe and put out
into the world, but I will and perhaps
we'd do that with you guys. But um where
he goes into great detail as much as he
can about it, but he said that it was
it was an elevated advanced
intelligence. This is the way is the one
thing that he said he just he never
there's nothing like it here on Earth.
It was
>> the the other detail I don't know if it
was your documentary or one of the other
reports I've read was that the whole
hospital smelt of this ammonia
>> that Yes, that was that was us. Yes,
that was one of the guys at Regional
Hospital and it seemed to have been one
of the deceased uh beans and the smell
was just and people had described the
smell even when the girls came in in in
within 10 12 feet of it. the smell
lingered in that area and the mother had
come within minutes of of and the
creature was gone but the smell lingered
in her nose and they all said that the
smell was really really intense and I
don't know if that was I don't I don't I
don't know if that's I I don't know I
don't know if that was some sort of
protective thing that they would excrete
when they're scared and feeling
threatened. I I don't know. Isn't it
tragic that the first contact with a
non-human intelligence is is is so
acrimonious that that essentially a
military agency is forcefully removing
that alien from receiving the kind of
treatment it needed to survive.
>> I mean it's horrible. I mean I find the
the the emotional and moral implications
of what we're talking about here quite
profound. Oh
>> believe me. I mean I do too. And when
when I asked Dr. Echelo on camera what
it felt like after 29 years of this
bottled up. He started crying. He just
you know he's been sitting like you
imagine the weight of that on his
shoulders and he he felt so much
compassion for this being that was in
captivity. He was so he just the love
the compassion the elevated
consciousness is what he said. He said,
"We have so much to learn from the eyes
of that being."
And yet for 30 years, it's going to be
30 years in January next year
>> since this incident occurred,
>> which is why the timing of your new
film, your updated film, is so
important.
>> The Brazilian government and military
have persisted with the claim that this
is all fiction. Uh they've dismissed any
kind of claims that extraterrestrials
were recovered. They've classified the
events as routine exercises. They said
that the creature was likely this
homeless man, Medino. That the military
vehicles were for standard maintenance,
not retrievalss. They said that the This
is my favorite one. The hospital aliens
were debunked as a dwarf couple.
[laughter]
>> Yeah.
>> Seeking medical care.
>> I heard that one, too. I know. Uh they
also said there was no evidence
supporting alien bacteria causing
Cheratee's death, which you
>> Well, that's you're going to you're
going to hear directly from the people
that did the autopsy and and studied the
samples from this from the founder of
the company that did the autopsy
directly. Janine, Dr. Janini, and he
said the same thing. I'm coming. I'm I
don't care. He's he's older now and he's
like, "This is what I saw and I can't
explain it and I've never seen anything
like it before and I've never seen
anything like it since." Oh, God bless
these people for having
>> and there are other things there. There
are other things like we're contacting
the lead general who's now retired and
there we are actually engaging with this
general right now.
>> Well, that was that was my next question
is I mean there's obviously been
political change in 30 years. Brazil has
become a slightly more progressive
society. Um the government's a bit more
open-minded.
What is is there any likelihood of
military officials opening up and
telling more about what they know?
>> There's a lot more a lot more going on
behind the scenes. There are um members
of I think it's parliament with it, you
know, senators um that are reaching out
directly and indirectly for possibly
hearings in Brazil. Um there are efforts
going on internally uh about meetings in
the United States. Um there are doctors
that are deciding you know contemplating
joining Italo coming forward. I had
meetings just recently with the whole
inner circle of of those doctors and the
people that run those hospitals. So this
is in my opinion I think this is the
beginning of the beginning. So I I could
I could I be wrong? I could be wrong but
I don't think so. There is a movement
happening unlike anything I've ever
seen. And it's not just on Virginia. I I
I think people have realized that to
some degree Congress isn't going to take
the initiative. It has to come from
people who've had direct knowledge and
experience, which is actually this is
probably a good time to promote it.
We'll do it at the end. James, if there
are people, military personnel who were
part of the retrieval operation who want
to speak to you confidentially and
exchange information, how can they get
information to you?
>> That's great. That's a great question.
Thank you so much. I I have a um Proton
email and I'll give it to you right now
over the uh it is moment of contact.
me moment of contact at proton.me
and we will be very mindful of any
national security issues or secrecy or
whatever the request is. Clearly there
are people who are operating under TSSCI
top secret compartmented clearances who
are forbidden from speaking about this.
And this is something that when you went
to Washington, you've also in this
moment of contact film, you've also gone
to Washington DC and covered the
congressional hearings where multiple
witnesses have given evidence of what
they know, what they saw. One of them is
Dr. Eric Davis. He's a friend of both of
us. He's an astrophysicist. He's been
heavily involved in investigating
paranormal UAP phenomena for many
decades. Uh he worked with uh Robert
Bigalow at the National Institute of
Discovery Science. He was part of the
BASS investigations, the federal
government funded investigations into
the subject. This is what he told you in
this exclusive interview.
>> Where's the proof? We have alien
spaceships in our possession. We have
bodies. Where and why can't I get the
specifics to verify those claims?
>> If the president of the United States
issued an executive order that
absolves me of all of my TSSCI NDAs.
NDAs are non-disclosure agreements.
Those are the agreements we have to sign
for every compartment in our SCI
clearances.
So if the president
waves or absolves my obligation to those
NDAs and I get subpoenaed by Congress,
some somebody on Capitol Hill, some
committee either in the Senate or the
House or the both to reveal everything I
know that I learned from my
investigations both unclassified and
classified into the legacy UAP crash
retrieval and hardware reverse
engineering and NA NHI programs. I would
do so if I could be waved from that or
absolved in some fashion by presidential
order. And if Congress subpoenas me,
yes, I would go and tell him everything
I know.
>> Dr. Eric Davis makes it very clear
there, James, that he [clears throat]
knows stuff. He, as you know,
investigated the claims that there was
this legacy UAP, NHI, non-human
intelligence craft retrieval program,
and he became aware, he's testified
before that there has been this ongoing
reverse engineering program.
What he's saying though is very
significant because he's essentially
saying if the president if Donald Trump
was merely to say you know overnight I
can wave those secrecy orders I can wave
those NDAs he Dr. Eric Davis and
presumably many other witnesses could
come forward. So how significant is Eric
Davis's comment?
It's extremely significant and you know
I I asked them those specific questions
because I feel the frustration among the
community among people that have seen
for instance you know Dave Grouch uh
Dave Grush back in 2023 making these
extraordinary claims and not really
providing publicly the extraordinary
evidence needed to verify those claims.
So I'm constantly thinking as a
filmmaker a documentary filmmaker how to
address those issues. Okay. So, you've
got someone with all these clearances
and you signed NDAs. How how do we
circumvent that? So, I've been asking a
lot of people like Eric Davis, would you
be willing, provided under the right
circumstances, we make a plea to
President Trump, whoever the president
is, the president of the United States,
wave the magic wand, provide immunity,
which they can do immediately. would you
testify under oath to a bipartisan group
of lawmakers and give the details needed
to verify the claims? And they're all
saying yes. So, let's do it. What? And
if there's nothing to it, then hey, you
got nothing to hide. And I can tell you,
James, I know multiple people who would
fall over themselves to come forward
like that. They're patriots, so they're
never going to breach their secrecy oath
unless they're authorized to do so. Um,
some of them have actually given
evidence in confidence to the uh Senate
Select Committee for Intelligence
privately in a skiff, but they really
want the public to hear their evidence.
And at the moment we seem a bit
hamstrung because Congress isn't passing
the disclosure laws that would allow the
protection of these whistleblowers to
allow particularly contractors,
government contractors, not military
employees, but government contractors to
feel safe about coming forward.
>> You imagine it's like, okay, there's
nothing to see here. Fair enough. Pass
the act. Pass the bill. The the
disclosure, you know, UAP disclosure
act. Like, pass it. I mean, why? Think
do you think James from your knowledge
of what's going on do you think
President Trump's been got at on this
issue or do you think as JD Vance the
vice president indicated uh just very
recently in an interview with Miranda
Divine I think her pod force one he he
he admitted that he's actually
interested in the subject matter but
that they've been distracted by so many
other issues but they're going to
>> so I'm I'm only speaking from personal
experience I I've interviewed Carter and
Ford and indirectly President Clinton
Clinton and uh they all basically said
that they made inquiries into the UAP or
UFO phenomenon and were not happy with
the answers they were getting. So, it's
extraordinary to think that the
president, the commander-in-chief of the
United States could get an intelligence
community to basically steer him away
from, you know, any information.
However, I think we're living in
different times now. I think there are
enough people talking about it. We've
had four congressional hearings in the
last several years. Um the the word is
out. The implications, global
implications are so profound that um I
think creating the right circumstance
and really making a plea to the
president, I think he just might do it.
So, I'm optimistic.
Well, so am I. I mean, I I I must
confess, I do think it's time for the
public to actually see what these
witnesses all know. And there are I mean
there are witnesses who want to come
forward with direct evidence. I mean I
I've actually spoken to people who've
touched these craft James. That's why
I'm very sure that the legacy program is
a reality. And what's stopping them is
these top secret SCI clearances that
require them to keep it confidential,
even to lie about it if they're asked
about it publicly. So, I I think the
president really is the ball is now in
his court about whether or not he wants
to be open about it. [gasps]
>> It's one of the reasons why I put the
quote from Eric Davis at the end of the
movie. I want the world to see like
these people are willing to come
forward, wave the magic wand, provide
immunity, and we will give the details
needed to verify these claims. You can't
say no to that. Like, if there's nothing
to hide, give them immunity. Let them
let them let them talk. So James,
obviously
your film is coming out. When when will
your film be coming out?
>> Later this year. We don't have an exact
date, but we will soon. Later this year.
>> But essentially, the 30th anniversary of
the Virginia incident is in January next
year, 2026.
>> Yes, the film will come out just before
that.
>> Let's take a look at your trailer, which
we're now going to show exclusively here
on Reality Check.
Have you been exposed to undeniable
confirmation of a non-human [music]
intelligence craft?
>> There is something out there and we
should know as the people what it is.
>> Do you believe that the federal
government is knowingly concealing
evidence about UAPs from the public?
>> 100%.
>> Yes.
>> Yes, sir.
>> Yes.
When you say crash retrieval, what do
you mean?
>> Non-human exotic origin vehicles that
have either landed or crashed.
>> For the first time in history, the names
of alleged companies and gatekeepers
analyzing recovered alien technology are
[music] being exposed.
>> Are any of you willing to name specific
individuals?
>> Dr. James Ryder, [music] Ed Lockheed,
Glenn Gaffne, CIA.
>> For decades, we've heard allegations of
the retrieval of objects of alien
origin. in 1933 [music]
saw discshaped object crashing.
>> It was not anything from this earth.
>> A UFO [music] crashed in Kingman.
>> Didn't drop out of the sky. It had to
come in [music] on an angle.
>> The feeling I had during the encounter
was like no type of aircraft that I've
ever seen before.
>> I saw the evidence. It's a crash
retrieval. There's a craft [music] and
there's alien bodies.
But one of the most well doumented UFO
crash retrieval [music] cases involving
live aliens took place in Virginia,
Brazil. There's a crash [music] vehicle.
[music]
>> [music]
[music]
>> That's why
[music]
Now, for the first time in history,
>> we have the most compelling firsthand
testimony
of communication with a live alien in
captivity.
How much time did he spend with the
alien in the room?
>> Wow, James, that trailer is
extraordinary. Dr. Italo Venturelli, he
oozes credibility.
>> You know, Dr. Helo is willing to put his
right hand on a Bible and take a public
lie detector test tomorrow. He has
everything to lose and nothing to gain.
And he's not coming forward anonymously.
>> Well, I would love to see him and so
many of these direct witnesses that you
found in Virginia come forward to both
the Brazilian Parliament and the US
Congress and give their evidence in open
public hearings under oath.
Uh yeah, there's there's things going on
behind the scenes right now to
facilitate things events like what
you're talking about.
>> And let's hope that President Trump or
someone close to him, maybe Marco Rubio,
the Secretary of State and the acting
national security adviser who does have
a strong interest in the UAP subject and
has admitted that this is a subject that
needs to be taken seriously. Um maybe
maybe JD Vance who indicated very
recently in another podcast that he was
also interested in the UAP issue. Maybe
we can see some leadership from the new
administration and show some guidance to
the public about what's really been
going on. James Fox, thank you so much
