Good day and welcome to Reality Check
Q&A. I'm your host Ross Kulart and here
to ask me the hard questions my
colleague and friend Megan Orata. Good
day Megan. How are you
>> Ross? I'm doing great today. How about
you?
>> Very well, thanks. Very, very well.
>> Well, we've had fantastic feedback from
your recent episode with James Fox. I'm
going to hop in. I want to first share a
comment from the YouTube page, and I
want your reaction to this. This guy
says, "If Dr. Davis has not been
assassinated before talking about
face-to-face interaction with Alien,
that it's being allowed to happen as
part of the ongoing slow disclosure that
by design continues releasing
increasingly more details over the last
eight years. On this trajectory, the
next eight years will be mind-blowing."
>> Wow. I I wish that was true. Um there's
a great saying, and I've used it before
in my line of work. Fans of the show
will be familiar with my vernacular. Um
always assume, should we call it a
screw- up, a screw-up before a
conspiracy. Um I I generally think that
um there is no plan, no disclosure plan
in place. I I don't think that there are
people in government who are pulling the
wheels and making decisions about
disclosure.
>> [sighs and gasps]
>> I think there was a plan prior to the
Clinton Trump election 2014 2015 uh that
was shelved when the Pentagon and
certain people in the intelligence
community con realized that Donald Trump
was going to become president and I
don't think uh they saw disclosure as
being inevitable because Clinton wasn't
going to be the president and I think
they feared she was going to expose all
I don't think there is any kind of
credible gatekeeper disclosure roll out
going on. In fact, quite the opposite. I
think that there is a bunch of
gatekeepers who have rationalized in
their own alpha male way. This is a
secret that is best kept from the public
because they really can't help
themselves and they need to be protected
from their own stupidity. So that's why
it's important we keep on applying the
pressure to make sure that uh the new
administration under Donald Trump does
ask the hard questions.
>> Okay, here is the question. This is from
Jessica on X. Can you share what caused
the long delay and getting the film out
to the public? Have any more recent
edits been made? Secondly, while some
deception is sometimes you is used in
investigations if it leads to harmful
manipulation and discrimination, it is
unethical and often illegal. Is there
any discussion in this film about the
lengths that some have gone to in order
to cover up cases where humans were
harmed by the phenomenon?
>> I presume there she's talking about
Moment of Contact, the re re-released
James Fox film. Is that right?
>> Correct.
>> Right. So she's not talking about Age of
Disclosure because there have been huge
delays on Age of Disclosure. So Moment
of Contact is a James Fox film that was
released, I think, back in 2022.
And the interview that we did with James
Fox was about the fact that James has
been doing incredible great
investigative work securing further
information with further interviewees
who've taken their time to decide
whether or not they want to speak
publicly about what they know. Uh in in
one particular case it's um Dr. uh
Sylvestri I think his name is the uh
it's Dr. Italo Sedestri who who's the
man who's made the decision as a
neurosurgeon at the regional hospital to
come forward. He originally was too
intimidated about speaking publicly and
so you can hardly blame James or anyone
else really for wanting to um uh get
this guy on camera. He's been pushing
the bloke for years. But it was as James
explained to us in the interview that I
did with him the other day. It was a
decision that was prompted by his own
imminent mortality. Literally, the poor
doctor was suffering a heart attack,
lying on the floor of the ICU, [gasps]
and thinking, "Why on earth would I be
going to my grave with this incredible
secret? The public has a right to know."
And good on him. Good on the good doctor
for making that decision. And we should
protect and make sure that
whistleblowers and uh people who speak
out like him are protected. Um, I think
it's so important. So, I don't think
there have been unreasonable delays on
what James has done. His film was
originally published in 2022. And what
this is is a re-release. It's an update
of his moment of contact film with some
quite extraordinary new interviews. One
with the neurosurgeon who was a direct
witness to the alleged alien being in
the operating theater in the hospital.
And the other is the pathologists who
did the work on the poor gentleman uh
Chavez I think his name was the military
soldier who policeman who um died as a
result of contracting a bacterial
infection from the scratch as he carried
the being in his car to the hospital. Um
in both of those cases it just takes a
while. Investigative journalism is an
iterative layering process. And as I've
learned over the years, quite often the
best scoops come after the first initial
story. People see the story and then
they go, you know what, I think I can
add to that. And so that's why it's
really important. James actually left a
an email address. If there's somebody
out there, particularly people from the
US who were involved in the US Air Force
extraction of this being and craft to
the United States. James's email, if you
want to send him a tip, is moment of
contact at proton.me.
moment of contact at proton.me. or you
can contact us here at reality
check@newsnation now.com.
>> All right, Ross, we have Atlas reaching
out to us on X. He says, "At Ross
Coltart, I'm excited for Fox's new movie
and the release of Vera's Age of
Disclosure, but I was curious if you've
heard mumblings of any other upcoming
projects or hopefully more congressional
hearings.
>> I'm excited too about The Age of
Disclosure. I think it's going to be a
cracker jackack film EPD by Lou Alzando
and Dan Farah. Um, I'm aware of the
people featured in it and I think what
people will sit up and take notice of is
that this is a film that features people
from the very highest levels of the US
intelligence, defense executive, people
who are speaking out about the reality
of the UAP phenomenon. Um, are there
other things coming? Well, if we can
take one takeaway from what James Fox
was saying, it's clear from what James
has indicated in his interview with me
that there are discussions going on on
the hill in Congress probably from the
opaces of the oversight transparency
committee. That's Rep. Luna, Rep. Tim
Burchett's uh committee which is uh
investigating claims of a UAP cover up.
Um it does look like from what um James
indicated to us that there's an effort
underway to try and get some of these
witnesses from the Brazilian Vajinha
case to give evidence in the United
States. I am aware of um other goings on
uh to try and get other witnesses to
come forward in Congress. But look, one
of the big problems and I I keep on
saying this, but I think it's important
to remind people why this has been
stymied. Congress has been got at. It
has been knobbled. Politicians have been
corrupted. They have been induced
improperly to not do their job as
politicians, as Congress people. They
have breached their obligations of
accountability and oversight because
they are excessively influenced by the
national security states lobbying and
inducements. And so also are the
staffers inside Congress. Too many of
them are beholdened to the jobs that
they're going to get in private
aerospace after they finish their job in
Congress. Too many of them see it as a
lucrative stepping stone into a private
aerospace career where they can earn
hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's a
disgrace really when it means
essentially that the capacity of
Congress to do its oversight role is
constrained. And there was, as we know,
an attempt by several fantastic
politicians to bring in UAP disclosure
laws, laws that would have allowed the
protection of other whistleblowers from
within the legacy retrieval and reverse
engineering program, particularly
contractors. This was really important.
I'm talking to people who are working
for private aerospace companies who are
telling me they want to give evidence,
but there aren't the protections in
place in Congress to protect
contractors. That's why things are being
stymied on the hill.
>> Okay, we have Charles writing us an
email. He's asking, "There continues to
be a global conspiracy to withhold
classified evidence regarding non-human
intelligence be intelligent beings and
non-human developed UAPs. What in your
opinion would change that position?
Thank you, Chuck."
>> Oh, it's pretty clear. Um, a decision by
the Trump administration to take this
issue seriously. Um, I think we should
take heart from recent comments by uh,
Vice President Vance and uh, also
previous comments by Secretary of State
and now acting national security adviser
Marco Rubio. Both gentlemen have
indicated and they're obviously at the
very top of the Trump administration
just under the president. Both men have
indicated they have a strong desire to
get to the truth of the UAP mystery. And
President Trump himself during his
campaigning indicated very strongly that
he wanted to see declassification of UAP
files and the release of further
photographs and videos. Uh I don't think
there's any good reason why the Trump
administration so far to date really
hasn't done anything about this. What
I'm being told by people inside the
administration is that they've just been
distracted. They've been distracted by
trying to resolve peace in the Middle
East, the economy, the government
shutdown, and of course um uh the
ongoing dreadful war in Ukraine. Uh I am
assured that this is going to become an
issue of concern for the Trump
administration. I'm not holding my
breath. I've seen other administrations
make similar promises and nothing
happens. But one of the things about
President Trump is he is his own man.
He's an iconoclast. He doesn't really
care what people think. Uh he's very
strong in his views and frankly he's a
deep skeptic um about the people who
constitute what he calls the deep state.
And if if ever there was evidence of a
deep state, if ever there was evidence
of a group of people within the national
security intelligence community who are
misusing their power that is derived
essentially from Congress without
congressional oversight. It's the people
who are controlling the legacy retrieval
and reverse engineering program who are
concealing this program and flat out
lying to the public. The big worry I
have is that there is either a
presidential executive order from the
Truman Eisenhower days that in some way
is being used to gag successive
presidents or whether there's an ongoing
presidential executive directive, a
peed, an emergency action directive I
think they're called, which would
essentially mean that there are good
reasons for the president to keep this
all secret. Maybe there are agreements
with non-human beings as David Grush
indicated back in his interview with me
in June of 2023.
Whatever it is, I think the public have
to make it clear that this is an issue
that they want investigated. We we have
an ongoing crisis now in Europe. Some of
Belgium's Belgium's airspace was closed
yesterday and probably still is as far
as I know because of drone incursions
over all certain parts of Western
Europe. Airports are being closed. And
what's interesting is the
electromagnetic pulse weapons that are
normally used to dr down these so-called
drones, let's call them drones, aren't
working. So whatever is happening is
there is a national security crisis
right now in Western Europe where
successive governments are finding they
cannot do anything to respond to
so-called drone incursions over their
territory and people are pointing the
finger at Russia.
Is there any evidence, any solid hard
evidence that Russia is responsible for
this? I'm no apologist for an
authoritarian dictator like Vladimir
Putin, but the simple fact is no one has
presented any hard evidence to show that
the Russians are involved. It's based on
speculation.
Who or what is responsible for the drone
incursions in Western Europe?
These are the kind of issues I think
that justify why UAPs need to be start
taken seriously by governments
particularly the US government because
sooner or later I think people are going
to smell a rat. Do they want to be
fanned out and exposed for the lies
they're currently telling the public? Or
do they want to be leading by the chin
and showing leadership and actually
exposing the I I suspect illegal and in
some cases criminal activities of the
people that have been responsible for
this program. They may think of
themselves as patriots, but are they
really?
>> Okay, Ross, here's an email coming in
from Sebastian. Hi, Ross. and Megan,
congratulations for your work. Ross, you
have stated that according to your
sources, the 2004 tic tac near San Diego
was Loheed Martins. However, Commander
Fraver said in Lex Freedman's at all
that there was a gigantic structure
below the water and some kind of
relationship with the tic tac. That
doesn't add up to the Lockheed theory
unless they have reverse engineered an
alien submarine. Can you elaborate on
that? Thank you very much.
>> Look, it's a good question and yes,
you're correct. Um, David Fraver did
report seeing an object possibly uh
sitting just under the ocean where the
tic tac was hovering. [gasps] I don't
know if he said that there was a
relationship between the tic tac and the
object under the water other than the
fact that the tic tac was hovering above
an area of water that looked like it had
something underneath it. Um, it would be
speculative to suggest that David Fraver
was saying that there was a
relationship. I don't think he would
have any evidence and I don't think he's
ever suggested that there was a
relationship between that object and the
object that he perceived under the
water. Um,
all I'm saying is, and I'll reiterate
this, is that sources have told me that
the tic tac that was seen by David
Fraver was being operated or controlled
by people associated with Loheed Martin.
And as I've said earlier, we don't know
if that means the object was constructed
by Loheed Martin. I actually think
that's highly unlikely. or whether it
was being operated for example
psionically by psionics who were in the
employee of Loheed Martin which I think
is more plausible. Um it also doesn't
discount the possibility that the other
objects that were being seen in the area
by my friend Kevin Day and witnessed by
multiple people on the USS Princeton and
the USS Nimttz. It doesn't rule out the
possibility that those other objects
that were being seen at somewhere
between 28 to 80 28,000 to 80,000 ft
were of nonhuman origin. I think it's
highly implausible that they were all
Loheed Martin objects. What I am told is
that that day there was a very stupid
blueonblue attempt. An attempt to test
technology that was in the possession of
Loheed Martin against a carrier battle
fleet. And this came about as a result
of a conversation I had with somebody
who pointed out to me and reiterated to
me something I've written about in my
book that when Kevin Day had a
conversation with the I think the
admiral or the captain on the USS
Nimmits
he showed no surprise at all about the
incursion by this anomalous object. You
have to ask yourself why.
>> We have Proctor Hopkins reaching out to
us on X. Has Ross looked into the
Project Blue Beam claims and how they
could be eerily echoing current events?
>> Ah, Project Blue Beam, the most hor
chestnut in all of the UFO conspiracy
theories. So, um, Project Blue Beam, I'm
assuming this is the one you're talking
about. There was a Canadian guy, I think
he's now passed, called Serge Monest,
and he came up with this wacky
conspiracy theory, and I do think it's
wacky because it didn't happen when he
said it was going to happen. I think he
said it was going to happen in 1995 or
1996. [gasps] And essentially it was a a
staged fake alien invasion leading to
eventually a luciferian conspiracy to
take over the whole world in some kind
of authoritarian world government. Um he
wrote a book called Project Blue Beam
and the really cool thing is NASA was
the villain. NASA was leading this one
world conspiracy. And um look, frankly,
I I I think the claims of Serge Monest
about Project Blue Beam are a load of
hogwash. And I'm not saying that the
idea of a potential staged alien
invasion threat isn't a possible stunt
that might be pulled by somebody in the
gatekeeper group that are protecting
this legacy program. That's long been a
completely separate speculation by
people like Dr. Steven Greer from the
disclosure project and it goes back to I
think claims made by a lovely woman
called Carol Rosen who I've had the
privilege of meeting who was wa von
Brawn's assistant and a lot of people
have tried to point holes in Carol
Rosen's claims but essentially Carol was
a PA to Dr. Vera von Brawn, the former
SS officer who was a Nazi who was
brought out under project paperclip and
incredibly was protected and given the
opportunity to run the entire Apollo
space program. And one of the things
about Wavon Brawn is he always said that
he was reluctantly draoned into the SS.
So I should make that point. But
essentially, I think he was at the end
of his life very skeptical and concerned
about what he believed the US government
was doing with its knowledge allegedly
of nonhuman intelligences. And he
allegedly confided to Carol Rosen, who's
told me about this, and she's told many
people about this, including Dr. Steven
Greer, who was the first to break it,
that um there was going to be some kind
of staged alien invasion as an excuse to
impose authoritarian control on the
planet and that they would use possibly
holograms and um projected images of
UAP's craft as a way of constraining
restraining the public and and
controlling public opinion. Um is it
true? I don't know. I've got no idea. I
mean, it's an allegation that's been
around for years. I actually don't doubt
that Wernner von Brawn did say it to
Carol Rosen. A lot of people have tried
to point holes in Carol, but I find her
credible. I think she's telling the
truth. Um, I do think Weravon Brawn was
worried about the potential misuse of
the technologies that he allegedly
became aware of that the United States
was in control of. as allegedly
my friend and um in informant Yuri
Giller, the famous psychic told me in a
previous reality check interview. He
says that he was shown alien bodies by
Dr. Wavon Brawn. Um I just don't think
all of this is complete hogwash. There's
some truth in this. I just wish I knew
what it was. So yes, I think project
blue beam as proposed by a Canadian guy
called Serge Monest probably 30 40 years
ago is a load of bollocks because it
never happened. I think he said it was
going to happen in the mid '90s. It
didn't happen. But I think that claims
that the people responsible for the
legacy program might try and stage some
kind of stunt. Look, I wouldn't put it
past if if if Richard Dolan is right. If
our friend Richard Dolan, the noted UAP
academic, is right that there is some
kind of breakaway civilization on this
planet that essentially is using this
technology to to gain some kind of
superior advantage to the detriment of
the rest of humankind, then um I guess
it's not at all inconceivable that they
might try and use some kind of fascist
takeover by using a stunt such as a fake
alien invasion. I don't think we should
rule that out. I mean, the bottom line
is this is why Congress needs to
reassert control over the legacy program
and stop pussyooting around and
accepting it. It it needs to start
digging. What really worries me is the
supine
dosile way that so many politicians are
approaching this issue. They still
titter and giggle nervously when they're
asked about the UAP issue. And yet the
US government has admitted that UAPs are
real. There is enough on the public
record now, not least since our
interview with James Fox and the
revelations that he's made about a
likely recovery of an alien spacecraft
and an alien being or beings to raise
the very serious likelihood that the
United States is lying through its teeth
about what it has recovered. And so yes,
we should be asking hard questions about
what the intentions are of the people
that are aware of this program and are
they planning some kind of a stunt. I
don't think we should rule that out. Um
and I think maybe the fact that um Carol
Rosen says she was told this by Wner von
Brawn and that other people have
speculated about some kind of fake alien
invasion using recovered craft. Maybe we
should take this a little little bit
more seriously and maybe this is another
reason why government should actually be
looking at this as some kind of national
security imperative rather than
tittering into their coffee cups and
nervously looking in the other direction
when people say, "Hey, listen. What
about this UAP issue?" And this is why
you, the public, need to make it clear
to your elected representatives that
you're not going to put up anymore with
this kind of nonsensical ridicule
response to the subject of UAPs. It just
doesn't wash anymore. This is a serious
subject for investigation and it's
worthy of investigation by our
politicians and our executive
representatives.
>> Okay, Ross, we will hop over to X for a
question from TJ. Hi, Ross. So, the
other day I was meditating and I was
struck with a creepy thought. What are
the chances that Kenneth Arnold was
lying about the saucers he saw during
his flight in Alaska? Was it a real UFO
sighting or just the beginning of all
alien UFO scops?
>> I don't think there's any chance at all
that Kevin Arnold was lying. And the
reason I say that is because what people
have missed and I I came across this
when I was writing my book and looking
at that that summer of 47 experience.
There were sightings both before and
after Ken Kevin Arnold's sighting um
over I think it was Mount Reineia uh
which corroborated what he said he saw.
Um there was a forest service warden in
a tower uh which was on the same flight
path as what Kevin Arnold described and
he gave a chronologically exact account
of exactly the same movement of exactly
the same objects at that time. There
were also commercial air pilots and I
think there were at least three or four
other witnesses that corroborated Kevin
Arnold's story. So no, I don't accept
that Kevin Arnold was making this up. I
actually do believe him. And moreover,
if people look at the history of the
summer of 47, what he was saying was not
in any way unusual. This was a period of
history where there was just an
explosion of anomalous sightings of
weird objects.
>> All right, we have an email from
Caroline in Amsterdam. Hello, Ross and
Megan. At the latest UAP hearing,
journalist George Knapp mentioned that
he had taken with him Russian UAP files.
Do you know if these files are open for
the public yet? And are you planning to
write a new book, maybe? I loved your
inplain sight. Keep on the good digging.
>> Good question about George's files. Um,
I've actually checked this with George
directly. So we know that there were I
think as George has actually told us
it's about 200 or so documents or pages
of documents that were tended as
exhibits into the congressional record.
Now I don't know why the full set of
thread three documents have not yet been
made public as I'm sure was George's
intention. But what we do know is that a
very limited number of those documents,
I think about 22 to 25 pages in total,
have been made public and they do not
provide the full extent of the detail
that was obtained by George. Yet again,
the big question is who the hell is it
in Congress that is making these
decisions? The clear intent of George
Knap was to make sure that those thread
three three documents were made
available for public consumption. Where
the hell are they? And who are these
anonymous staffers that are making these
decisions about what should or shouldn't
be made public? I I I do think we need
to start rattling the cage about this
stuff. And it's a very very good
question. As for the question of whether
I would be writing another book, books
are like babies. Um, basically I'm told
by women I love and know, including my
beautiful wife, that u uh when you have
babies, you only decide to have another
one when you've forgotten how painful
the last one was. Uh, it's the same with
books. One of the big problems as well
with books these days is so many people
rip off books. Uh people don't
understand that if you spend two years
writing a book, often for very little
financial reward as an advance up front,
um the only way, the only prospect of
making any money out of it to compensate
you for your time is to hope that
somebody might actually buy it. And the
big problem is so many books now are
being ripped off. They're being copied
and digitized and illegally downloaded
onto sites where people can download
them straight away for free. It's a
disincentive and it's completely
undermining the whole publishing
industry. While we're on the subject, by
the way, I received my copy of this
amazing book yesterday uh by Andy
McGrillin um which is just fantastic.
It's an atlas of unidentified flying
objects and anomalous phenomena. It's a
pear. It's got a forward from my friend
Diana Walsh Pasulka and it tells the
story of a lot of the more interesting
UAP sightings all over the world
including one of my favorites which is
um actually very close to its uh 50th
anniversary the uh Fred Valentic story
the guy who disappeared over Bass
Strait. Um I'm hoping to have Andy on at
some stage to talk about that and and
good on him for writing a book. I hope
he makes some money out of it.
Well, Ross, to put a bow on the big
mystery of last week for our loyal
viewers, as you can see over my
shoulder, I did find your book and
secure its home back on the ladder.
>> Thank you very much, Megan. Thank you
very much. Nice to see.
>> Yep, absolutely. That was the last
question for today. Russ, I am not sure
if we will be doing a Q&A next week
because you are going on a big trip.
>> I am. In fact, I am heading to Peru,
Bolivia, and Easter Island doing very
much the same kind of tour I did in
Egypt last year. We will be bringing you
a very detailed story of what we see
there, including hopefully some
tridactyls.
And uh I intend to be investigating the
megalithic ruins of those countries to
see what we can aduce and what we can
find. More to come. Looking forward to
it, Megan. And uh I hope my my fellow
reality check Trekies will suffer in
silence without Q&A for a couple of
weeks while I'm away. And we look
forward to seeing you soon on the other
side.
>> Absolutely. Thank you, Ross. Now, uh, if
you do want to ask questions, uh, when
we do return, obviously we will store
your questions and keep them for a
future reality check Q&A. The way to get
