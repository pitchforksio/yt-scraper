Hello and welcome to Reality Check. I'm
your host, Ross Kulart, and today we
have a guest I've long wanted to get on
the show, and we have the perfect excuse
because he's just published his latest
book. Jacques Valet. If ever there was a
21st century Renaissance man, he's the
chap. He was born in France, but he
lives between Paris and San Francisco.
Most of the time in San Francisco, and
he's currently talking to us from Paris.
He is renowned for his contributions to
computer science, venture capitalism,
and especially, of course, the study of
unidentified anomalous phenomena in the
paranormal. Jacques's CV is
extraordinary. He earned a bachelor's
degree in mathematics from the Sbon. a
master's in astrophysics from Leil
University and a PhD in computer science
from Northwestern University in
1967. His early work had him as an
astronomer at the Paris Observatory and
he co-developed NASA's first
computerized map of Mars in
1963 at the University of Texas. at
Stanford Research Institute in
California. He contributed to the
Arpanet, which was the pioneer, the
precursor to the internet. He's a true
internet pioneer. And from Silicon
Valley, he founded and served as a
general partner in multiple venture
capital firms, including NASA's Red VP
Planet Capital, which focused on high
technology startups. His notable venture
capital initiatives include electronics
for imaging, Acuray Systems, who
developed the Cyber Knife for cancer
surgery, and Neopotonics, which uses
optical network
nanotechnology. Aside from, of course,
his brilliant financial career,
Jacques's a towering figure in the study
of anomalous and paranormal phenomena,
UFOs, UAPs. His interest was sparked in
1955 when he saw a UFO over his
Ponttois's home and intensified in 1961
when he allegedly saw tracking tapes of
an unidentified retrograde satellite
being destroyed. He worked with the
astronomer Jay Allen Heinik who was the
scientific adviser to the US Air Force's
Project Blue Book. And yes, of course,
he was the inspiration for the French
scientist character in the Spielberg
movie, Close Encounters of the Third
Kind. But it's his books we're talking
about today, his learning over many
decades. He kicked off with his anatomy
of a phenomenon in 1965, which was one
of the first scientific books on UFOs.
His seinal passport matimagonia in
1969 was the first to propose I think a
multi-dimensional hypothesis for UAPs
suggesting they might originate from
realities beyond conventional spaceime
which was a challenge to the
conventional extraterrestrial hypothesis
and this hypothesis this perspective
which has been expanded in works like
the invisible college and wonders in the
sky it posits
UAPs as part of a complex phenomenon
influencing human consciousness and
culture across history. Now, you'd think
at 85 Jacques would want to slow down,
but he's actually released another book
in his formidable Forbidden Science
series. Forbidden Science 6 is called
Scattered Castles and it tracks the very
interesting years from 2010 to
2019. Jacqu Valet, I had to do that
enormous biography of you because I
wanted people to know exactly who you
are and why it's such a privilege to
have you here. Thank you so much for
talking to Reality Check.
Well, thank you very much for having me
and uh you know listening to this u is
uh you know a reminiscence of of many
challenges over the over the years and
uh it never stops. I mean there are more
challenges now.
Now Jack, I wanted to get from you off
the top. I've got a pretty cl good idea
of where you stand, but I thought I
should ask you off the top because I
haven't seen you asked this for a very
long time. You've got a friend in a
group of scientists and ex- intelligence
officials who collaborate uh in the old
OSAP investigations with for DIA with
Robert Bigalow and you keep in touch
with those people. You call them the
lone stars. And in your book, you talk
about how they all take for granted that
there is this US government craft
retrieval program that the United States
is hiding a covert UAP craft retrieval
and reverse engineering program. And I
had a look at a lot of your interviews.
I've never seen you asked definitively
where you stand on that. Do you accept
that there is such a program?
It um certainly the the information that
we got within within the team by the way
you know I highly even though we no
longer work as part of an organized
research. We each do our own our own
research and we compare notes once in a
while. But I I've kept, you know,
enormous respect for the uh for the
group and and for the the talents in the
group. The the idea of well, you know,
all the the information about crashed
objects from space, that's not new. I
mean, this we were talking about this in
France a long time ago. Okay. uh do the
Americans have uh you know something
that they've picked up in the desert and
so on but it's not um it was anecdotal
but there were there were books about
that already you know speculating on on
this and it's not until
um I think the 70s that
um that Roswell you know was became back
into the news with thanks to Stan
Freriedman. You know, Stan Friedman was
a respected u engineer and physicist uh
who had worked in in high technology and
aerospace companies in California. and
uh his analysis of Roswell was
convincing that there was something had
happened there even though there was no
witness on site at the time but it
became the model. So this was you know a
long time before you know the big group
became involved and so on. What we did
was to try first with Neds which was as
you know not classified and not was
sponsored by Mr.
Bealo National that was the National
Institute of Discovery Science the
Robert Bigalow National Institute of
Discovery Science NIDS just for our
audience. Yes.
Uh and uh but this was you know the best
we could do uh in in speculating about
what those whether those crashes had how
many there were and how reliable they
could be. Uh Dr. Highex team uh at Kufos
had done research on site in in New
Mexico and other people had done that
also and it you know it was also a
source of confusion. Everybody had their
own theories and of course there were
skeptics. Uh and the
skeptical view was was legitimate
because there was no credible witness at
the site gathering information that we
could take to the lab.
However, uh as time went on, certainly,
you know, with my own resources, I I I
went there and as you know, uh together
with Paola Harris, I reinvestigated
u a case that we're still continuing to
look at. uh in 1945 two years before uh
before Roswell and similar area of of
New Mexico. So uh by by now there is a
lot of information
uh there is a lot of testimony that has
been well recorded and and well
analyzed. Um the unfortunately within
bass that technically should have
had access. Now if if we had had access
to that we probably couldn't talk about
it. Uh so we can we can talk about
speculation though. Um and
uh the the the new information is
surprising because the new
information that you that you're
mentioning uh has has to do with actual
experiments out in the desert typically
or um trying to
um corral some of these objects and get
them to land or to uh to become visible
so that they could be analyzed and uh I
don't have a position on that. I have
not been at the site. Um and uh but I
trust the people who are making those
reports.
One thing that I like about your book is
you offer a transatlantic perspective
because you do move between France and
the United States. What you you talk
also to a lot of people in the French
government, the French military, the
French intelligence
community. Do they take for granted that
the United States is concealing
knowledge of the UAP mystery?
Yes, but for a different reason. um in
the day going back to the days when I
was working with Ma Michelle who was you
know a French philosopher very
interested in science and so on um who
was my initial mentor in this I I I kept
telling him uh look you know I'm in
touch with Dr. high neck and so on. And
they um they in in the US, you know,
there is all this um all this
information about supposed crashed
objects and so on. And uh and there is a
study um under a blue book, you know,
how come France isn't doing anything?
And he said, you know, it's a perfectly
good question. And I asked uh my contact
at the French Air Force, you know, who
is gathering information. This was
before the CNES, before satellites,
before that. Uh we're talking about, you
know, the mid60s. Uh and uh he came back
and um he said, "Well, I had another
lunch." Of course, it's Paris, so you
have lunch with people, you know, you
and and then then you you talk seriously
around dessert and, you know, coffee and
and and and maybe a little bit of recur
and um and you get much better
information this way. So, um, the man
from the the French Air Force said,
"Well, you know, I I went to my contact
at the US Embassy and I asked him, I
said, you know, you guys have are
talking about UFOs and so on. Should we
cooperate because we've got files. I
mean, we've got observations from
pilots, you know, uh, in North Africa,
you know, in France and so on." and we
could compare notes and and he said my
my contact made a couple of calls to
Washington and he came back and said
look this was again the mid60s so there
are lots of bad things happening in the
world you know it's cold war u the you
know the situation with Russia with the
USSR in those days you know is is very
much you know and
uh uncontrolled and uh we don't need one
more thing to distract everybody you
know so yes we keep track of of of that
but uh we would not so they there was no
cooperation at the time as we had hoped
uh between France and the US and there
hasn't been really since then uh you
know on the academic you know whether
there is something else. I don't know.
But it would it would have to be very
very specific and not within the circles
that that I know
about. What prompted I'm fascinated by
GAP, the French agency, quasi government
agency that investigates UFOs, UAPs.
Why did France of all countries in the
world create well before any other
country a formal office for
investigating the phenomenon?
Well, you know, French academics are
very much inspired by rationalism. you
know that uh you know
the the study of of science as a study
of nature and the study of phenomena and
but there was it wasn't easy there was a
lot of
controversy about you know why do we
spend that much money there it wasn't
that much money it was just one you know
one aerospace engineer who's still still
alive Dr. Per um and uh that you know I
had shared my files with Dr. Per when he
indicated his interest in doing this and
and we were working together and he then
assembled enough
um formal information that he could
present at at a high level uh within the
ministry to convince them to to create a
small a small cell you know a small
project within the space agency.
So what is France's position on UAPs? Do
they believe is there a formal
government position on UFOs, UAPs? Do
they accept that there is a nonhuman
intelligence or is it still an open
question? as in there was a crisis uh in
the uh in the mid to late 80s when many
French academics said why are we
spending all this money um on this you
know the Americans have stopped their
project project blue book you know
because they didn't really have any
answers and so we don't have all the
money that the Americans have so why are
we doing this way we could the there are
so many other things in science that are
unknown that would be interesting to
study. And
um the
uh my my friends in France did a survey
of French
influential leaders in science and
government and law uh and the press and
they came back about 50/50. the the
weight of the advice and and those were,
you know, sort of dayong reviews of the
data with each one of of these people.
There were about 50 people. So, it was a
serious study. The consensus was there
probably isn't anything to UFOs because
otherwise the Americans would be doing
something now. Uh but the the the public
is is very engaged and if we don't do
something the public will think we're
hiding aliens. So we should we have a
duty of information to the public and
therefor they restarted the study they
were going to close down. I will pin you
down. I'm going to pin you down sir.
What do you think? Do you think that the
United States is concealing knowledge of
non-human intelligence?
Well, um, you know, that's what's being
discussed in Washington right now. I
know the, uh, you know, of course, I've
followed every step of this. Uh I I've
been asked to uh not to testify but to
uh uh to
brief some of the the people in the the
intelligence committee of of the Senate.
Um and uh you know I've had some
experience before in my computer career
with the way things work you know at the
level of Congress. Congress is not a
scientific body. It's not their job. So
the funny thing is that we have a lot of
scientists, you know, coming forward
explaining the science and that's it's
of course it's relevant, but that's not
what Congress does. Congress is there to
to feed into future laws and long-term
decisions that involve budgets and maybe
science and research. Okay. So I I think
there is a misunderstanding there. Okay.
There is no misunderstanding in the
skiff you know with the staff with the
staffers for the intelligence community
and so on. I mean they they they know
what we do and we know what they do.
Okay. So, uh, with with respect, Shark,
you've kind of avoided my question
because what you often do is you've
deflected you very carefully. I'm
waiting to see what's going to come out
of I I I'm interested in your personal
view and and I want to because I mean
for example you're good friends with
Gary Nolan, Professor Gary Nolan, a
renowned Stanford immunologist and
Gary's quite upfront about his personal
experiences as a child and his strong
belief that there is some kind of a
cover up going on that the United States
is concealing knowledge of UAPs,
knowledge of a non-human
intelligence Are you not able to say
definitively where you stand on that
yourself or are you being a scientist?
You're you're hedging your bets. I could
not give you a um a a statement, you
know, from the BAS project which was
classified and still is. uh a lot of the
things that we did you know I was
responsible for the the computer side of
it and the computer analysis which was
cut off after two years two of the five
years we needed to implement AI on top
of what we had so that that part has
been partially declassified thanks to uh
the work of uh Dr. Keller and others. So
I can I can talk about that. I can tell
you what what some of what what we did.
Uh there is no question as you know like
like Gary uh I I saw an object when I
was 14 and a half or 15. There is no
question about that. It wasn't
conventional. This was you know bright
daylight, blue sky, middle of the
afternoon. Um, you know, my mother saw
it first, called me. I saw it. Uh, it
was a disc. It was it was not just some
point of light in the sky. You know,
this was a a stable disc with a a dome
on top. The friend of mine about half a
mile from my house had looked at it with
binoculars. So, when I learned that, I
asked him to draw it and he drew exactly
what I had seen. Okay. So that you know
both Gary and I share you know share
that you know direct experience with I
he's had more profound experience
with something more you know more
personal than in in his environment but
I've I've had something like this as I
you know as I mentioned in the book in
in this book you know with essentially
an apparition in in my problem. So the
there is no question that's why we don't
spend a lot of time arguing with
skeptics. I mean they have every right
to be skeptic skeptical and that's what
the way science works. You know the the
discoverer of pryons you know prize in
medicine was laughed at for 10 years by
his colleagues at the University of
California. you know, medical center,
you know, the top research place in the
country, one of the three top hospitals
until people said, "Okay, you're right.
I know a molecule that's this way can
turn this way and it can turn deadly
just by changing some of its shape." The
that wasn't known before. So, this is
not unusual in science. I mean you
expect that people will criticize. Now
what we what we do know is that um you
know to not to escape your question is
that those crashes are reported by
reliable people you know and I've been
there and I've spoken to them. I've I've
spoken to people not only in France and
California but throughout the US. uh you
know I did a number of investigations
with Dr. neck. In those in those days, I
went six times to Russia, actually twice
to the Soviet Union and four times to
Russia under professional, you know,
uh, professional need and found that
people at certain times were quite free
to talk about it. and we published an
article in in Russia in the 60s that had
four million readers in in the uh in tr
which is the union magazine.
So I think those those things have been
going on for a long time. Now it's
delightful that people are coming into
into this now and asking all those
questions again because in science you
know the the answers you got 20 years
ago are not the answers you're going to
get today. So I I think that's a normal
process. I don't have any problem with
it.
One of the things I love about your
journals is you pepper them with
incredible little insights. And one of
my favorite quotations that you have in
the the latest book is one from Cole
Kellaher, one of the scientists who
worked with you uh on the I think the
Bass project and also the NIDS as well.
and he says, quote, "A central working
hypothesis is that an ancient parasitic
intelligence has been on Earth for
thousands of years. A related hypothesis
is that there is a small minority of
humans endowed with above average
discernment.
This cadra of humans belongs to a
particular gene pool considered
dangerous by the phenomenon because they
alone can create counter measures to the
control system. What do you think of
that analysis by col
I'm completely I think it's the fruit of
many discussions that we had as as a
group. K was was running most of the
day-to-day administration and business
and research for Bass you know for for
the duration and I I worked uh with him
and under him in in the part that was my
you know my belly week um there there is
um it's it's partially hypothetical but
uh that's what you have to do in science
you make a hypothes is on you. You
now science doesn't consist in in you
know throwing up hypothesis. I mean
that's that's the first half. The second
half is designing research that's going
to confirm or or shoot down the
hypothesis. And until you've done that
you haven't done science. I mean you
know hypothesis is a diver. Okay. You
have to way of test you have to have a
way of testing it. So the implications
though of that and I noticed this is
something that you develop as well in
your book messages of deception uh that
you wrote in the 70s and you explore the
the psychic and abduction elements of
UAPs. The idea that UAP encounters are a
deliberate mechanism to influence human
consciousness, culture and societal
evolution. a kind of a control system to
shape human beliefs and behavior. And
you speculated, and I think you were the
first to do this, that this doesn't
involve physical ETS, but a nonhuman
intelligence that operates
interdimensionally, or if Colm's right,
it's what is it? Um,
intraterrestrially using psychic
interactions to provoke psychological
and cultural shifts. I mean, that's a
very different thesis, isn't it? And
it's interesting. I It struck me as
interesting that Cole had come to a very
similar conclusion that the two of you
have kind of put to one side the
extraterrestrial hypothesis. Let me ask
you this way, sir. Why couldn't it be
aliens from another planet playing with
us and trying to control us on this
planet? Why is it more plausible to you
that it's an interdimensional or
intraterrestrial if you like phenomenon?
So, um, when I first decided
to apply the the tools I knew and the
tools I had, which included computers at
Paris Observatory and later in in Texas
in California,
um, I tried to do what you're supposed
to do in science, you know, start from
the data and and begin to look for
patterns. Uh that's what you do with an
unknown phenomenon and you want to see
if it replicates something that we
already know, you know, from something
else. And so I did that and u in my
first two books I I argued about, you
know, the extraterrestrial
uh hypothesis that this is uh this was a
a a good approximation of what people
were seeing.
Then you know when I wrote Passport to
Maggonia which
antagonized people on both
sides, the the first edition was a
complete failure and and then people
thought about it and came back and it
was reprinted and reprinted and
reprinted and uh now people consider it
probably the most significant thing that
I did. Uh it's a classic, Jack. It's a
classic. I love your book. Well, um I
it I I I I knew that I was breaking, you
know, my choice. I I was uh was just
breaking everything because if if that
phenomenon has influenced us in
different guises across the ages, then
then there are other contradictions that
people were kind enough not not to pin
me down. But one of them, but I had to
think of them first. Okay. One of them
is how come the vehicle is the same? I
mean, if you buy a car today, it's not
going to look like a car you bought 10
years ago or five years ago. Okay? And
the and you know, the guy will tell you
in five years it's going to look very
different again. Okay? Maybe you should
lease the car instead of buying it. So
the
um that's what we're faced with if but
then you know that kind of difficulty
when you overcome it in science it opens
up other things because uh the argument
I I was reading something this morning
from a scientist again saying yeah you
know NASA has discovered something that
could mean that there is life on this
planet. planet next to a
star 140 light years away. But anyway,
we can't get there. Well, why can't we
get there? Well, we can't get there
because of Einstein. And you know,
Einstein said, "You cannot go faster
than speed of
light." The people now are saying u you
know, I stay in touch with Eric Davis
who is my my master in physics. uh you
know my my physics is astrophysics of
years ago and uh it still works but it's
not up to date okay uh Eric is up to
date and Eric says first you have to go
do away with time and space as
dimensions because there are secondary
things you know what's important is the
quantum foam and given the quantum form
there is no reason why you couldn't go
faster than the speed of light uh It's
just an arbitrary limit. That was it's
true that the the the equations work
with C speed of light as a limit. Okay.
So that's good science. But there could
be exceptions to that. One of the
exceptions was something that we were
teaching at Northwestern. Dr. Rhinneck
was teaching it to the kids at
Northwestern in the the 70s that there
could be another universe 5 minutes
ahead of us and then it takes them five
minutes to come here at whatever you
know at the speed of light and uh maybe
even faster. So we cannot put limits on
that. You know that's one thing that
Gary uh you know Dr. Nolan has said very
clearly there will be you know
revolutions in science in our last
lifetime. You know there will there have
been re you know revolutions and there
will be more and this is one of them.
Okay. So let's let's stop talking about
the speed of light as a limit. It it's a
limit in the mathematics. It's not a
limit in physics.
So when you explain in messengers of
deception what you mean why you argue
for the um interdimensional hypothesis
you you suggest that what they're doing
what the phenomenon is doing is it's
presenting itself in ways that challenge
existing paradigms scientific
materialism or religious dogma. It's
inviting us humans to think about
ourselves, if you like, ontologically.
It's encouraging us to question reality.
It's a long-term strategy, you suggest,
to guide human
evolution. Why? Why would another
advanced life form want to guide the
reality of a bunch of primitive apes on
a rock in this solar system?
Well, you you could
u meet and interview some very good
scientists who say we live in a
simulation. This is the way the way they
simulate our so you know if you play
simulation on the web um you know there
is a control system I mean you you put
yourself inside the control system or
you're not a player if if you're a
player you have to uh to be to agree to
be part of the control system however in
when I first came up with that I was
challenged by people here In
France, very good biologist from the SBA
and couple of other friends who said
Jacqu you
know there are different kinds of
control systems. You know the Nazi death
camps were control systems. You know, I
spoke to Jacqu Berier who had been a
French spy during the war and uh had
been one of the people locating Penund,
you know, the the rocket center and so
on and and was one of the first French
atomists. So he was interested in, you
know, where they the whether the the
Germans could build an atom bomb and so
on. He said that in the camp where he
was interned because he was caught as a
spy, tortured and and you know kept in
those camps, all of a sudden the firemen
from Munich were arrested by the Nazi
and brought into the
camp for three weeks because they had uh
talked about going on strike and the
Nazi didn't didn't I mean this was a
wrong time to go on strike. So they put
them there for three weeks and then they
went back, you know, to where they came
from and they were no longer on strike.
So he said, "Jac, you have to realize
that even a
closed control system can be a teaching
center, not necessarily something where
you're going to be destroyed or you're
going to be uh burned alive, you know. I
mean you some people will be burned
alive but you know they so there are
control systems that are
uh that are you know like system of laws
or system or a prison and there are
systems that are open. A university is a
control system. The rules are not
written down anywhere you know on
whether you get your PhD or not you know
you have to maneuver you have to find
the right the right path through the
control system it's not written anywhere
so we which one which one is it I mean
that's a question
that's a basic question that's the only
question I I think I know someone who
would agree with you about us living in
a simulation I was watching Lex Fridman
uh interviewing Elon Musk and Elon Musk
was asked what would be the first
question he would ask the ultimate AI
and he said what lies outside the
simulation uh so it's obviously the big
question are we a simulation never
underestimate Elen Musk I was uh many
years ago I was on a panel with him in
Strasburg about the the future of space
research church and he was talking about
um uh communication on the moon, you
know, and they he had a scheme for
communicating on the moon, you know, the
the the moon doesn't reflect uh radio
waves, so you can't use radio on the
moon, you know, so you have to use
something else. And he was busy uh
designing it. It was very interesting.
But he was he's very different today
than he was then.
Clearly, Jacques, what we do know, and
we know this from the Tic Tac incident
that I know your team were involved in
researching. And one of the stories you
tell in your book is an incident
involving two United States RC1 135
elint aircraft who were intercepted by a
UFO in um the Mediterranean in November
1993. And it's it's an amazing story.
I'd never heard it before, but
essentially the unknown craft placed
itself in formation on the starboard
side of the US plane, close enough so
that the crew couldn't even see the
whole craft. The edges appeared to
scintillate, and the surface was
composed of panels over inlaid panels
that were rectangular and translucent
with edges that would disappear,
dissolve, or go out of focus as one
stared at them. They were luminous like
opal with a hint of violet. And it's
interesting because time and time again,
and you described this in your book,
there's always these guys who turn up in
suits and spoil the party by basically
making people sign an NDA. So in this
case, they're interviewed by men in
civilian suits who turn up in a C130
from Germany. They make each crew member
sign an NDA. all the material they've
obtained, all the data they've obtained
is taken into custody. Did you ever find
out any more about that sighting? And
why why is there this cover up? What why
do these men in suits turn up to take
away the data just like they did in the
2004 tic tac sighting as well? What's
going on? You know, I I I've um run I've
raised and run five venture funds in
California. venture funds that are
dedicated to uh essentially the first
dollar, not not the financial
enhancement to a company, but the first
the first dollar
and the the CEOs of those companies know
obviously know of my you know my track
record and and they also know that I'm
you know interested in strange things.
the the reason they create those
companies is that they are interested in
strange things too, you know, otherwise
it would be working for IBM, you know,
in somebody's basement. So they
uh they uh when their family sees a a
UFO, you know, they have they like to
have property on the coast looking over
the Pacific and so on. And they they see
all kinds of things. And this obviously
is not reported because, you know, it
would be controversial and when you're
running, you know, a high technology
company in California,
uh, you you have to be taken seriously
by Wall Street and by, you know, you you
have you keep thinking about your next
round of financing and which bank you're
going to go to. So, it's not the time to
be in the papers, you know, talking
about flying saucers. Uh, but they trust
me enough uh o over the years. They tell
me what they've seen because they think
somebody should know about that. I mean,
the case I mentioned was um a man
who was in California, now is with one
of the, you know, threeletter agencies
in in in Washington. He was coming back
from actually watching some maneuvers in
in Southern California and there were
reports of strange things among the the
firing you know that was going on in the
within the maneuvers and his question
was
uh you know this was not reported you
know I saw it because I was there and I
was there to watch the the proceedings
and to analyze it. So, I had all the
information, but it didn't go anywhere.
Why wasn't that reported over to
Washington? Know that. Well, uh I said,
look, you know, you have those
clearances. I don't
anymore, you know. Uh why me? I mean, I
can't answer that question, but he said,
"Yeah, but you've gone to other
countries where the same thing happens.
There seems to
be, you know, a a layer of just fog over
the whole thing that those things are
almost accepted as as part of, you know,
they show up and they go away and and
there is no need to report it. And
furthermore, if you report it, you could
be in trouble, you know, from your
superior officers. So, uh, he was he
gave me another example. This was after
we had left our telephones, you know,
with the waiters and so on and we were
sitting in a corner of the restaurant.
Um and you know another example where
uh a ship had uh encountered an American
vessel you know Navy vessel had
encountered something. This was not an
image uh and uh had been seen by
everybody. recordings had been taken and
uh you know some some guys came on the
plane you know landed on the carrier
uh went to see the commander
uh of of that that fleet and confiscated
all the data get got back on their
flight he said that's not
unusual the what's unusual is that I saw
for the paper. Nothing was signed. There
was no name. That's a violation. It's a
violation of security rules.
That's why they why why are they doing
that though? I mean, I I we we can tell
countries, you know, this is what
Congress should be looking at. It's a a
violation of military security rules.
The paper was not signed. Nobody knows
who these guys were. Presumably the
commander was given something that
authorized this, but this overrides
everything
else. Now,
um I'm I'm eager to um you know, this
was not part of NIDS. This was not part
of anything else. This was just a
personal conversation with someone you
know
from who trusts me. uh because he knows,
you know, this is unusual inflammation
that tends
to wash up, you know, and and it gets
picked up. But um it it means that there
is another there as as they say, you
know, in in some science fiction movies,
there is another machine somewhere.
The men in black
Maybe, although I had trouble taking the
Men in Black very seriously. You know,
there was there was a a witness in
Texas. something had fallen from the
sky, probably some piece of some souse
or something. And they came to his uh
his home, the the guy who's a black
officer who had been in Vietnam, and he
said, "Uh, well, this obviously came
from God, so I'm not going to give it to
you because God dumped it in my garden.
If he had wanted you to have it, he
would have dumped it at at the White
House, Lord." you know and and he uh he
kept it. So they the men in black were
defeated in that particular
case. So you wrote a book back in the
1960s in 1965 called anatomy of a
phenomenon which made I think a very
creditable argument for rigorous
transparent collection and study of
UAP's data. uh you looked you argued for
physical evidence analysis and
interdisciplinary research. Now we're 60
years on from when you first made that
plea for that kind of data collection
and data
analysis. Have we yet done what you
aspired for Jack?
You mean in terms of analysis? Uh yeah.
Are we really doing is there the kind of
empirical data analysis that you aspired
for?
Um you know a lot of science is
empirical data. I mean a lot of biology
and a lot uh it's empirical data until
somebody
has can can build a a system of analysis
that that that goes deeper insight. But
just to develop this, forgive me for
interrupting, but for example, you were
doing the great, you know, I think you
were involved with NIDS. There was the
OSAP project, there was the BASS
project. In each case, the wonderful
research that was happening there was
frustrated by budgetary concerns or in
the OSAP case, um there was obviously
some kind of big gag that came down from
on high where you couldn't get um
special access program status and it
effectively hindered further uh ability
to take the research any further.
somebody doesn't want I mean you
describe a a UAP control mechanism if
you like whatever the phenomenon is it's
trying to control us isn't there at the
same time also a human control mechanism
that the the powers the the governments
of the world notably the United States I
think to some degree France even the
United Kingdom Russia China there seems
to be some collusion to shut down public
interest and and and study of this
issue. And I I'm just intrigued as to
why, you know, why is there that control
mechanism there? What's going on? Why
why do they not want us to ask these
questions?
So,
um you know, that's I mean what you're
presenting is is correct. I mean that's
the way it it presents
um in in science you know there are many
times when you think that nature is
against you I mean that uh just as
you're going to discover something
looking at Mars some clouds come between
you and you know between Mars and the
telescope or something and it looks like
there is something that wants you know I
I I blame myself first, you know, that
I'm just not smart enough to find
because, you know, nobody has come
knocking on my door. I mean, admittedly,
I haven't, you know, violated any rules
or any laws and I won't, but I'm not a a
whistleblower in that in that case. But
the the fact is
that usually when I when I attack a
problem
uh and I fail, usually it's because I
made a mistake somewhere and I have to
go back, get advice, get somebody
smarter than than me or better informed
or someone I'm infringing on a a
discipline that I thought I knew and I
don't really know it as well as I
thought. So I need I need advice and so
on. That's what I I do. I mean
networking like this is you know the key
to Silicon Valley. So I'
I've learned to do that. I I think that
there is a control mechanism outside and
in in a way it makes sense uh you know
that the the whole question of
disclosure
What is it that we're going to disclose?
You know, we're going to disclose that
there is a phenomena. Well, I can
introduce you to some farmers in Kansas
who have known that for 20 years, you
know, and they they they've seen more
things than all the pilots in the Navy.
Okay? I mean and and they know that and
they talk to each other and they talk
about they talk to each other. They talk
to the insurance companies, you know, if
something happens to the cattle and so
on. I mean all all those things are
going on. I mean we should stay out of
Washington and look at the rest of the
country. Okay. So the the the question
for me is uh how do I how can I build
something not so much in the classical
physics you know there are people who do
that very well and there is a tradition
of that but there is something called
information physics you know information
and energy uh we we get taught in school
that those are two sides of the same
coin that information changes into
energy and energy changes into
information in nature, you know, let
alone in the lab. Okay? Nobody has
really
formally started teaching the physics of
information. The physics of information,
you know, comes right out of, of course,
computer science. And there are many
people who use their computer and they
think they're computer scientists
because they can run a program. But
that's not the point. Okay? The point is
you have an information machine. What we
built with Mr. Bigalow was a very large
information machine that was going to
start giving us some answers once we
refined it. And we were cut off at that
point. Okay. I think that what we did
it's true what you say that we were
limited within bass you know bas was
given some very specific tasks as was
proper but within nids we didn't have
and I think nids was uh you know thanks
to Mr. Bigo really deserves a credit as
a researcher himself who has had
experiences himself and he and his
family and uh we we went very far very
very far with Neds in a way. Bas was a
retreat from what we had done at NITS.
There's there's a reference in your book
to the Holy Grail and I I I've been told
a story. I've been told that um what was
coming out of the OSAP project was a
proposal by Loheed Martin that they
transfer an intact craft to Robert
Bigalow and that he spent about a
million dollars pre-preparing a
warehouse for the receipt of that craft
and that this was going to be the next
phase of if you like the ORSAP research
going beyond ond the the field research
the highly wonderful research that had
been done by the team on the OSAP
project um that they were then going to
have an intact craft that they could
surveil. What happened, I understand, is
that people of deep religious conviction
inside the US Air Force in particular,
uh, took offense to the idea of any more
serious research being done into the
phenomenon and they intervened to stop
the special access program status being
conferred to that project, which
effectively gagged any further research.
Am I wrong sir?
So the there are two two things in in
what you said Ross. I mean the first one
I cannot confirm. I was not briefed on
OSAP. I was no of course very familiar
with with BAS and cleared everybody was
cleared at the same at the same level.
uh and but this did not come up in my
you know if it
did I would say you know I can't talk
about it because it would be classified
it it's not within the classified
briefings that I I've had so I I don't
know I cannot confirm the thing we've
lit at all so I'm not the guy to ask but
what was what was the holy grail you
were referring to in the book Jacques
when you're you're talking about how um
if the project gets SAP status there
will be a holy grail.
So,
um the the fact that it is a fact
that many people but probably more
within the Navy from my my own
experience than the Air Force or or the
Army uh in those that I met have a a
religious
uh
concern. Okay. Um
I'm you know it may surprise you given
you know the fact that I I haven't I've
written very little about that but I I
tend to share that
concern. Uh I think we should take it
into account. I respect it profoundly.
um that has stopped me from you know uh
publishing certain things that I want to
think about and I I want to think about
and you know privacy of you know
uh trying to put long-term some of these
long-term ideas together
um even though I'm not a you know
practicing
question that I I have. Can I explore
this respect for Yeah. I mean I I want
to take you down that path Jacqu because
this is very interesting and I'm glad
you've started talking about that
because you say in your book there's a
quote the phenomenon is hurting people.
It is manifest and scary. You use the
word evil and what we've called
interference you say is very real. And
then you go on to say, as much as I
thought the Collins elite, which is the
the term that you use for the people
inside the Pentagon and the intelligence
community who are blocking this normally
of a strong religious belief system. As
much as I thought the Collins elite was
wrong in its fundamentalist attitude, I
wouldn't blame anybody for talking about
demonology here.
That's a really interesting comment
because I have to admit I've recently
been speaking sir to to people who've
been telling me that when they've had
confronting and quite terrifying
experiences with the phenomenon and I
I'm not in the least bit religious
myself but they've invoked the name of
Jesus Christ or Mother Mary and invoked
that to try and tell the phenomenon to
leave them alone and go away. And in
every case they've said it's left that
it has respected that invocation of the
name of Jesus or mother Mary. Do you
think it's possible the Christians are
right?
Well I I I don't think all
Christians adhere to this. Uh I think
it's it's
one sort of formal interpretation of
um you know of of of the writings
um the
um most Christians I meet um you know
are are open to after all if you know
that that's a a question that has gone
on for ages. You know, if we if if we
stop looking at what the evil side is
doing, we're in fact turning the world
over to them. I mean, so uh it would be
like saying we're not no longer going to
investigate murders, you know. I I think
we we should know as much as we can. uh
and I think that's the the view
certainly of many Catholics. We should
know as much as we can about the evil
side if if we accept that there is an
evil side that's active that's actually
impinging on what we think what we do.
There's a love there's a there's a
lovely quotation you have in your book
where you say Colin's elite members
believe that no one should be interested
in anything that comes from Satan. I say
you say if we're about to do battle with
Satan, we might as well learn everything
we can about his toys. And I I I like
that quote because I mean it is a silly
argument that because it involves the
possibility of demonology allegedly, we
should ignore it. I mean, you're quite
right. If even if it's evil, even if
it's something malevolent, we should
know about it.
So that raises the question of what
exactly should we disclose because
people have
taken you know have uh put me on the
spot for saying this on on another talk
show that we should be we should not
disclose without thinking of the
consequences of disclosure. And they say
but everybody says we should disclose.
Yes, that that's true. But the moment
you disclose, you have to answer a
hundred other questions. And many of
those questions are questions about
religion. Uh questions about, you know,
the the basic texts. Uh certainly you
know my friends in Israel don't think
about UFOs the way uh you know people in
the in France or in America think about
that and I've had you know enough
contact with people in Saudi Arabia
during meetings there and so on to know
that if you believe in the
jin today not the legends
the gin today, you know, in
sophisticated families, you know, in
real have had experiences with the gym.
And I was talking to them about how
wonderful the uh, you know, Arab legends
were. And they said, Jack, you know what
Arab
legends? You know, we had a Jin and you
know who turned one of one of our family
members into a crazy automaton. And we
had to call, you know, a holy man to
read the part of the Quran that
addresses a
jin and and
you you know asking bypassing the the
kid, you know, talking to the gin inside
the kid saying, "Look, we have to
apologize, but recognize that this is a
kid." He didn't know that there could be
a gin there. He impinged on your space.
He didn't know uh that you should please
go somewhere else. Now this is this is
talking directly to this is not talking
to God. This is talking to the gin.
Okay. This is today Saudi Arabia. Okay.
You know sophisticated family that you
know has sent one you know one of their
sons to Stanford. So this is this is
real. I mean, we're we're not just
saying, look, you know, UFOs are real.
The aliens are here. That doesn't that's
a beginning of a lot of problems. And
I'm I'm not saying we should have
answers to that. We don't have answers.
that we should have a a a a structure
within which people can express their
concerns, their terror, you know, their
own experiences and where we can discuss
it.
There's another good reason cited in
your book for why we should be cautious
about what we wish for when we talk
about disclosure. And and that's it's
interesting because there are polar
arguments in eupfology. There's there's
one group in eupfology who argue that
whatever the phenomenon is, it's loving,
it's kind, it's benevolent, and it bears
no threat at all to humans. And that we
should we should forget this threat
narrative. And they have a go at Lu
Lzando all the time for talking about
threat. And it's interesting because at
the other side of the poll there are
incidents that you've spent a lot of
time looking at that the Brazilian air
force looked at in the Calaras incident
and the quite shocking chubba chuba
attacks on Brazilian people during the
1970s and the 1980s. There is no doubt
at all is there Jacques that the
phenomenon whatever it is has on
occasion killed people murdered people.
So um I wouldn't say that. Ah
interesting that's interesting. what I
would what I I said and I know there's a
somebody has taken my my word out of
context as often happens is is uh you
know has made it sort of a joke that I
you know I believe um the I think he
used the word murder you know
they the
um what has happened and we've known
that for a long time and you know that's
something that Ned's looked at that Bas
has looked at certainly in the medical
files we have
uh instances of people losing their life
as a consequence of being close to a UFO
or being exposed to the light of a UFO
and and those are documented medically
some of them medically well documented
and I've I've partic participated in
some of that some of that research
obviously I mean that's something that
we should be interested in so that's if
you like incidental damage it may be
that these people have just
unfortunately come into close proximity
to UAP whatever the phenomenon is and
yes but if if if if a six-year-old kid
runs after a ball in front of a Mac
truck that that that girl is going to be
killed and there is nothing we can do
about it and there is nothing the driver
of the map truck can can do about it.
Okay. What about what about the cases
like the chaos clearly accidents? Okay.
That there is radiation. There is
radiation we don't understand. I mean
there are distressing cases though and
I've seen the photographs from the
Brazilian Air Force where they show
people who have been mutilated. Dead
bodies. Dead bodies with holes cut into
them. parts of flesh cut away. I mean,
that does look like a deliberate injury.
And more importantly, in the Calaras
incidents, there are descriptions of
people being hit with what appear to be
directed beams of energy? Yes. Um, uh,
can we exclude the possibility that that
is intentional? Could, are you
suggesting that that's incidental
damage? So, I I I asked that question.
remember there there have been
expeditions since you know more recently
and so on but I was there when the men
in who had been in in command you know
invited us to the military center that
controls one one quarter of the Amazon
is of Amazonian you know descent he
speaks the the dialects of the Amazon
and he understands the territory. Um the
um I also spoke to three of his officers
separately after the the discussion at
the at the military center. We went to a
private house where they wanted to show
me more about what what they had
experienced and what the people they had
interviewed.
And
um we can't do that anymore because they
you know they they are dead or they are
scattered somewhere else. The the the
the leader of the task force died about
10 years ago. and he was the one who
spent the most time because and the
reason he invited me and and our group
which included Brazilians and and
Americans who spoke who had worked in
Brazil
um was that he wanted to know what was
going on in France. you know, he didn't
exactly believe what he was told by his
American contacts and he wanted to
combine it with what people knew in
Europe and he knew that I had done
research there. So furthermore, Brazil
has a common border with
France which many people don't realize
until they look at the map. Okay. So, uh
that's no a lot of funny things like
that culturally that are just
delightful. But the
um there were there was an intent to hit
people. But I also spoke to the doctors
uh who had attended to especially one
one woman who died you know in their
care and u the doctors
said she was in in a state that was
weak. She had a weak heart.
uh we knew that we don't think yes she
died as a result of exposure to the
trauma of you know a big big scene with
UFOs in the sky and so on uh which would
have terrified anybody. It was low
altitude no craft and so on. Uh but she
died out of the trauma of of the nervous
you know reaction to this. Uh but she
was not hurt by a beam. She was not
singled out to be to be killed. She just
died there.
Um in other cases, people that I've
interviewed, including one guy who was
in perfect shape, was an athlete and so
on, had been running all night, you
know, through the forest. It's not the
jungle. It's not it's not exactly the
Amazon forest. It's the border to the
Amazon. So in those days it was an
agricultural area but unpaved and so on.
And uh he was actually targeted by an
object. They call them shupa shupa. You
know that was positioning itself within
the trees to hit him with a beam. And he
was fortunately in good enough shape
that so he would hide behind trees. He
would run towards a a village. He got to
a village and found shelter there. Uh
but it took him a week to recover. He
was just completely exhausted. And I
published the picture you know that I
recovered there of a woman who had been
hit. Now she had been hit. But what's
what's interesting to the physicists is
that he was pinned to her hammock. You
know, when you go there, you learn very
quickly you don't want to sleep in a bed
for a lot of reasons. And the uh so she
was in close to a window. There is no
there is no glass in the window because
what you want as much air to circulate
as possible. you know, it's very warm,
it's very wet, you know, and so so she
was in the hammock, a light, a beam, a
cumated beam, you know, came through the
window from that object and hit her in
the shoulder and pinned her mechanically
down to the
hammock. Okay, this is not just a beam.
we can
uh we can do I I've spoken to physicists
who said well you could generate a force
uh you know cimated within the beam and
so on I don't know what they're talking
about I I I just don't know maybe
they're
right it would be you know it would be
an interesting weapon but you know it
didn't it didn't kill her I mean there's
a photo. My photograph is of a doctor,
you know, looking at this and attending
to her. Uh, I was there 10 years later.
She was fine. I mean, she was she had
recovered from that. She no longer had
it. It
all the the thing that really sticks out
to me from your book is you've been
doing this shark for 70 years,
investigating this phenomenon pretty
much, ever since you had that sighting
as a young boy.
Are you any closer to an answer, a
definitive answer?
Uh, you could ask this
um of um you could have asked of of you
know a man I worked with uh you know,
Professor Sturok at Stanford. We were
working on the structure of the sun and
the structure of a corona.
uh are you closer to understanding it?
Uh uh he would have said well we've done
a few things but you
know there there is another layer that
we haven't you could ask uh you know Dr.
Nolan, are we closer to eliminating
cancer? And he said, he would say, well,
you know, my colleagues and I make
progress every day in documenting what
cancer is. And we we are saving a few
people now that we couldn't save five
years ago. Okay? And that's that's the
job you know is you you never that if
once once you resolve a problem in
science so you come up with relativity
you've opened up a hundred other
problems do you think we're meant to
know Jacques I mean do you think the
phenomenon wants us I mean you say it's
twigging our consciousness I'm treating
it as uh you know the faculty were very
very interested interesting, very
interesting university where I have a
privilege of you know being a student
and the my professors are not the folks
in Washington. I mean they they are
doing their job trying to regulate you
know the access on a large scale for you
know what we can do. My my teachers are
in, you know, in Kansas and Texas
and you know other places in the
Pacific. Uh, and they they tell me what
they've seen.
Well, it's a very honorable life's work.
Uh it does beg the question though
there's a moment in the book and I'll
I'll I'll wrap this up fairly soon but
there's an exchange you have with Bob
Bigalow where he says the cover up must
be the work of a supra national group a
brotherhood rather than one single
agency or country and when I read that
it resonated with me because of course
we've just had this new whistleblower
Matthew Bran come out and he said we
have the US as a country have allowed
ourselves to be penetrated, co-opted,
and corrupted by an internationalist
force that serves their interests and
views nations, peoples as tools, and
means to an end. And it struck me that
both Bob Bigalow and this young fellow
Matthew Brown have come to that similar
conclusion that whatever this is, it's
beyond nations. It's it's an
internationalist thing. Super national
as Bob Bob Bigalow called it. What do
you think?
So I've um as you know I've worked in
finance for the last 40 years. Um and I
I've met
uh some some people who were influential
in you know the theory of finance
and it's it's a topic that's current now
in the United States you know with what
what's going to happen to the stock
market and investment and so on.
And in in many cases, not just now, but
in many cases, what happens is chaotic.
I mean, you really have a feeling that
there are so many variables in the
system that the the only reason the
system hasn't blown up is that we don't
really understand what buttons to push
and it
somehow reasserts itself because there
are many actors. You know there's a
theory of actors of financial actors you
know what you buy what you decide not to
buy until next year you know why you
save money or why you spend money or by
and that's true at every level and some
of the
people that I've worked with and some of
the people from whom we got funds for
venture capital I mean those are the
leaders of you know bank investment in
unknown future areas. You know venture
capital venture is you know
and venture has a different exception in
French than it does it's a French word.
Okay. Um and then it it is in
insaxon. the the French think venture is
a danger you know you tell your kid
don't venture into this kid and in in
the US which I find delightful is the
venture is you know like the the the
great explorers you know the sails of
the uh you know of the ships moving
across the ocean thinking that there may
be an abyss you know where the ship is
going to fall any time And that's how
you discover India. And then you realize
you were not in India, you were in
America, India is somewhere else. But
that's that's the way you know venture
works. And that's been my world for 40
years. You know, you take intelligent
risk. You know, you if you want to take
risk, you go to Vegas. Okay. You But if
you come to Silicon Valley, you have a
reason to write particular check. And so
you have to think about where the where
the money comes from and how it's
regulated.
And there is I'm convinced that there is
no
superior you know cohort or cabal of
extremely wise uh financeers who decide
you know now we're going to give
presidents to China over India for this
and that they there are people who think
that but there are people who think
exactly the opposite and they're going
to be fighting And I've been on enough
boards, you know, watching the
interaction and the and and the fight on
the board. Of course, the the
board, you know, report is not going to
reflect the the fact that, you know,
they were at each other's throat for two
two hours. And
the there is an an impression of a great
mystery unfolding in finance and the way
computers came about the way the the web
came about and so on. It's it's not that
it's it's not that it's guy you know
mostly guys sitting together now
fortunately some women as well and
uh fighting not so much for the money I
mean again the money is I mean the the
money is important
but I've seen companies that had no
money and changed the world in their own
area. Okay. And again, it's not the
money. It's an alignment of will among
knowledgeable people. And um I think
that's that's what we're dealing
with. Now in with UFOs, I haven't found
them yet. Okay. I don't I I don't think
there is a board of directors. Well,
without risk there is no reward. And
certainly Jacqu Valet, you you more than
anyone in the last 70 years have
ventured into the realm of the
paranormal and the unidentified
anomalous phenomena with rigor and
vigor. And I I I think I speak for
everyone when I I say thank you for the
work that you've done. And I sincerely
hope that both of us in our lifetimes
get the answer as to what is truly going
on because I don't know how you've done
it for 70 years, but I find it intensely
frustrating that it's so hard to find
the answer. Well, you you have the key
to to that with all the the people at
your meeting now. Certainly, what's
going to happen in Washington this next
few weeks is going to be fascinating.
So, I salute what you're doing. Jacques,
