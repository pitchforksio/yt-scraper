Is it possible that this is something
that has been decided it has to be kept
secret from Congress? This is as

revealed to Congress if that's the case?
>> I [music] do. And I think presidents are
on a need to know basis. That's why I
like Trump cuz he doesn't really care
about all that protocol stuff as you've
noticed. And I would hope that he would
uh he would bust this thing wide open.
Heat.
