Good day and welcome back to Reality
Check. And this week, I'm very excited
to have our very dear friends, Donna
Leonardo and Jerry and John Tedesco, the
Nightcrawler team, our favorite citizen
scientists from Long Island, upstate New
Jersey, the people who do all the
fantastic work investigating anomalous
phenomena around the very interesting
approaches to JFK New York. Guys,
welcome back to Reality Check. It's good
to have you back here.
>> Hello, Ross. We're happy to be back.
>> Yeah, it's good to be back.
>> Nice to see you.
>> And um at some stage, I've got to ask
you about your take on the orb that
Megan Orda described, our producer,
colleague, who uh uh was in the Greek
islands. And I understand you've got
something to say about that. But I'm
very excited to talk to you all about
the ongoing work that you've been doing
because I know you've got three
particularly interesting sightings cases
that you want to talk about today. Um
there's I think to start off there's a a
multi- camera water UAP. It's an object
that appears to be coming in and out of
the water as it comes towards you and
then it goes up onto the beach and
you've captured quite extraordinary
imagery of that. Then you've got well
frankly a black triangle black triangles
multiple uh that you captured inside a
cloud and caught on radar. [gasps] And
then finally there's this really
interesting luminous object. But before
we get into that, I'm really interested
in drawing all of you on the broad
issue. What's your take on the whole New
Jersey, New York, Long Island drones
flap, as it was called? Was it all
hysteria as we're being assured now by
different debunkers and different
government departments? Were we all
totally misled? And was this just a
hysterical piece of nonsense on our
part, seeing things that weren't there?
>> No, not at all. Uh uh Ross, you know,
we've been we've been uh seeing these
things. We've been observing them for
quite a while now. Um quite recently, we
had recorded some uh some drone activity
down at Robin Moses. Um they look like
typical drones in this this particular
case. Um they uh kind of large uh
commercial type uh you know almost six
feet across in in diameter and um you
know this is something that you know
we've actually reported and and uh we uh
contacted the FBI about because this is
an area that you know the drone drone
flight is illegal uh simply because it's
a it's in the parklands near the near
the uh municipal airport out here JFK.
>> Yeah. Yeah, I mean as as I understand it
from where you guys stand looking out
from the beach towards the ocean, that's
essentially the approach route going
from left to right towards JFK
International Airport in New York, isn't
it?
>> Yeah,
>> exactly. And that's the thing is uh
these particular drones were unusual in
the fact that um they they resembled at
least a couple the ones that we got
close enough to view with with a a zoom
uh zoom lens it they resembled
quadcopters but um they were very
difficult to see even with the infrared.
uh they they consistently shut their
lights off uh and changed their
positions and when their lights were off
they were virtually impossible to see
except with the the fact that we had
night vision cameras or we had infrared
cameras.
>> Were they visible with the naked human
eye?
>> Uh no. When the lights went off uh you
couldn't even see you couldn't see them
with your naked eye. Right. Right. But
there was a set of uh you know it looked
like a set of spotlights on them or
flood lights of some sort.
>> Um when those lights were on you could
you could definitely see you could
definitely see the uh you know the uh
you know the extreme luminance coming
off the off the quadcopter itself. Uh
when the lights were off very difficult
the presentation was very difficult to
see uh even with the low light cameras
uh and uh IR very extremely difficult to
>> what about noise? Um, no noise at all.
>> No noise at all. These things quiet.
>> The other thing is I mean they could
have had a uh a light absorbing paint.
>> They were very they were dark or black.
>> That's actually a very good question,
Donna, because if you're describing,
guys something that essentially looks
like a quadcopter. Were you close enough
to have heard propellers, if there were
propellers, as you would expect with a
quadcopter?
We didn't hear uh we heard nothing from
these and we should have heard we should
have at least heard the uh the rotor you
know the rotors.
>> How close how close were you?
>> Yes. When they presented they were
roughly about a quarter mile away. Yeah.
Um and an altitude of uh you know about
seven or 800 feet. The interesting thing
is they were over the water. They were
off the coast. Um we had looked to see
if there was anybody operating a
remotely uh remote uh system to operate
them. There was nobody on the beach. Uh
there was nobody in the parking areas.
Um there there was no boats within range
that we could say. And these the first
area we saw them is off the coast.
>> Mhm.
>> And so do you think they're really
quadcopters? I mean, have you guys seen
what quite a number of people in New
Jersey have reported to me is that these
things look like a quadcopter or in some
cases they even look like a commercial
aircraft or a light aircraft and then
they somehow change shape. Have you seen
that morphing that goes on?
>> I I think that's the confounding
variables here. you know when we when we
see these objects they you know I think
there's some confusion as as far as you
know what folks are seeing at times they
present and they they do look like um uh
do look like drones uh you know there is
some kind of a wing structure or
something that you know uh presents uh
away from the body of the object itself
uh some kind of a lighting pattern uh
there is a flash uh that's the uh uh
synchronization of the flash doesn't
seem to coincide with, you know,
commercial air air traffic. Um, at other
times, uh, these objects look like just
orbs of light. And, um, you know, what
we wonder is whether or not we're
dealing with two different things here.
We're dealing with two different
objects.
uh the possibility that one is in fact
some kind of a um a drone a you know
some kind of a UAS vehicle and and the
other being uh you know an orb of some
sort you know and it's uh
>> yeah some kind of some kind of
surveillance operation maybe they're
surveilling these these orb like objects
which are very different
>> well that's one thing that has been
suggested to me is that that there is a
covert government private aerospace
response of deploying some kind of
highly advanced craft in that area to
monitor whatever these objects are that
that you guys are seeing. Um c can I ask
you this in any of the uh observations
that you've made with these objects?
Have you ever seen one morph? Because
multiple people have described to me and
in some cases sent me imagery of objects
that one minute looked like a quadcopter
and the next minute that same object
seems to look like a very very slowm
[clears throat] moving and not quite the
right shape or size 737 commercial
passenger jet.
>> Can I say uh one thing about the New
Jersey spotted drones? There was a lot
going on in that time period and I I
know other experts have already weighed
in last year, earlier this year that
there might have been might many things
in the skies and then people sent up
more of their own recreational drones.
Then you had municipal helicopters or
craft up looking plus other government
craft. And so after a while people were
reporting seeing things and probably not
aware that maybe some of these vehicles
were quite ordinary. However, um
something that doesn't relate to like
the sightings in Langley and Denmark and
everywhere else all over the world,
Germany, in northern New Jersey, right
before the flap, there was a private
company, I won't say the name, you might
have come across it, everybody on on X,
the I came across it and after the drone
flap had started and I just waited, but
no one else has really picked up on
this. There is a a man, a CEO of this
startup company. It's actually it's not
a startup anymore. They do a delivery
service. They're working in other states
already where they deliver pharmacy
items. They deliver food items. And
talking about things morphing, I'm just
wondering because it that morphing has
been cited in New Jersey only. I haven't
heard other reports of the other loces
when they when this company delivers.
They had a test facility go ongoing
during the flap in New Jersey somewhere.
And I've not been able to find out where
in New Jersey, but right before they
started their testing in the New Jersey
facility, the man posted and it's still
on X, there will probably be something
to the effect there'll be UFO UAP
sightings now. And there was. And now
the nature of how they deliver is there
is this very small
wing type of a craft that drops and
releases
a a drone and the drone then descends
and makes a delivery. But even if that
were the case in some areas of New
Jersey, I can't imagine that these types
of vehicles or the delivery service was
responsible for the lawmakers in in New
Jersey who said that they they were
followed on on or the military was
followed on in in the water with a bunch
of them and also that delivery service
is not testing or supplying customers in
areas like Germany, uh Virginia where so
that can't explain it all either. But
see how it just makes everything
confounding more confounding.
>> But also my understanding is that in
America it's a requirement. It's a legal
requirement that you display some kind
of transponder. So they should show up
on the ADSB or flight tracker, shouldn't
they, John and Jerry?
>> Yes. And that's that's the problem.
There's no identifying feature in this.
Basically, they' be flying illegally.
>> Yeah.
>> You have to identify yourself. You have
to have navigation lighting.
>> So it's it's it's bizarre. run into the
sheer numbers of these objects. Is this
[laughter]
>> I just want to drill down because I I
sent both Jerry and John uh an email
relating to a New York Post story that
had a guy at an air show claiming that
it was his new drone technology that was
responsible for the plague of New Jersey
sightings. What do you think of that
claim? It's a new startup company that's
got a new type of drone and he claimed
or somebody anonymously claimed from
within that company that they were
responsible for the rash of supposed
drone sightings.
>> Well, that I would say that that would
explain a small number of objects that
know or that people may have seen. It
doesn't explain the large number. The
other thing is we have sheriff's
departments out there. They were looking
at these things. These things were
moving at rates beyond the typical
speed. That thing looked like was
relatively slow. Yeah. Can I ask you can
I ask both you gentlemen one of the
things that I know the White House said
in January when um Carolyn Levit was
first asked about this and Trump honored
a promise to find out about what was
causing this supposed drone flap. She
came back with the explanation that
these were FAA, Federal Aviation
Administration authorized quote research
drones. You guys, I know have been in
touch with the FAA and the FBI. Have you
had any indication at all that the FAA
authorized research drones in that area
at the time? There's never been any such
acknowledgement from the FAA to my
knowledge.
>> It's never been an acknowledgement. The
other thing is uh why wouldn't they
notify all the law enforcement divisions
and and the uh it's a safety becomes a
safety hazard. It doesn't really makes a
lot of sense. So, so is the is the is
the ongoing sorry is the is the drone
mystery let's not even call them drones
the mystery objects you guys are still
seeing them
>> absolutely
>> so so do you think the drone flap
socalled ever went away or did the media
just stop covering it in the main
>> the the drone-l like objects that we're
seeing seem to pop up in a September
nove September to November time frame or
or maybe into early December
And we've seen it in 2022. We saw it in
23. And uh um we just saw it recently.
And they they're we usually see them
between the hours of 7 and 11. Yeah.
Right.
>> Yeah. Generally between before 12. And
you know it's uh uh and this seems to be
a climax in in November.
>> Yeah. So
>> this is 7 7 to 12 at night.
>> Yes. Exactly. Yeah. And then you have
these orb like objects that are out can
be out all night long and they just pop
in and out which are very very different
from from what these drum
>> you very kindly put together and thank
you for doing this great work guys.
You've put together really helpful
briefs for me to understand some of what
you've been seeing recently. And there's
an event that took place on the 5th of
July this year 2025.
It starts off with what looks like an
orb hovering over the ocean. Talk me
through and we'll show the video here.
Talk me through what you saw that
evening.
Okay, so this this was an object that uh
you know presented um over the water. Uh
initially what we saw was something that
um uh roughly about 600 ft from the
surface uh off the Atlantic Ocean. Uh we
saw an object that uh uh was um not very
luminous uh very very low low light not
not really in the IR some visible light
was present um and we noticed that uh
the light uh presented in the same basic
area the same um uh area of the sky. Um
within a short period of time that
object disappeared and we saw this
what's looked like a sphere on the water
uh extremely bright uh luminous sphere.
Um
>> are you seeing are you seeing this with
your naked eye or only with your
hyperspectral or flur camera?
>> This this was this was invisible to the
eye completely invisible. It was only
through the uh the hyperspectral
cameras.
>> Wow. Were you getting it on radar? uh
nothing on radar and the object might
have been too small for radar anyway. Um
>> and it was also close on the ocean
surface. So we we would get kind of a
>> we would get a reflection from from the
water. It's not something that that
can't be uh you know sustained between
you know whether or not it's it's a you
know a separate entity from the water
especially that close. [clears throat]
>> Um the object um you know presented
itself um uh like I said like a sphere.
Uh we had multiple cameras on it,
multisspectral cameras uh from different
uh locations. Um Gerald was able to
visualize it through a thermal camera,
believe it or not. And uh uh he was able
to see a a very uh clear sphere
three-dimensional
um that um seemed to have some kind of a
a murkiness to it or reflective activity
from from the water itself. Um, and we
believe the only re the reason why we
saw the object was might have been from
sea spray or something some kind of a
cooling effect.
>> Yeah, it might have been the water and
it it seemed that might have had a
reflective surface and what was and with
the moisture from the water it could
have been reflecting reflecting the
water but it made it noticeable.
>> So using the thermal camera was it
warmer or colder than the sea water
around it?
>> It was actually colder. Yeah, it was
slightly colder. Right. So, it's not a
Chinese lantern or something simple like
that.
>> No, no, no, not at all. Not at all. No.
And uh this was a perfect sphere.
>> It was a like I said was this was a
thermal image. This it it's not a it
wasn't an artifact. I was using a
high-end thermal camera, a fleer camera
with uh 25 time zoom to look at it. And
uh it was uh was bizarre because it it
it stood on the water on its end wi
without being disturbed by the the uh
the wave action of the water.
>> Did it go into the water?
>> In the video that you've sent me, it
does look occasionally like it's gone
into the water.
>> Right. But with no disturbance of the
water this there was wasn't uh there was
any kind of a disturbance no disturbance
that we could record that we could see.
um which is typically the case if if
there was a an object floating on the
water if it it was actually moving you
know between the crest of the waves that
sort of thing
>> bob up.
>> Yeah, that's something that that that
that we didn't see at all.
>> And it wasn't bo in the video you'll
notice it wasn't bobbing up and down. It
was and it wasn't being you know covered
by the waves and the thermal too. I
notic it just disappeared and then it
was there.
>> Yeah, it just
>> I didn't see it. I didn't see it
submerge. Right.
>> So which which direction was the wind?
Is is it coming with the wind or is it
moving intelligently directing itself
against the wind?
>> No. So this is the interesting thing.
The wind uh that that day was that that
particular time at night was moving in a
uh in a um uh a northwest direction and
the object was moving uh almost due
east.
>> So it was moving against the wind. Wow.
>> Exactly. Exactly. and and we should say
it was stationary for for a short period
of time and then it began to move to the
east, right? And the object at times was
extremely bright uh you know was giving
off enough luminous energy um where it
can be seen in the IR um the brightest
thing on the surface of the water. Um
and uh the interesting thing that that
we uh that we observed right away was
that there was no reflective there's no
there was no uh light impinging upon
anything around the object like the
water the surface of the water
>> which it seemed to be self-illuminating.
That's what I don't understand is how
come you can see this object with the
thermal camera and the hyperspectral
camera but you can't see it with your
human eyeball.
>> Right? So, so again this is something
that you know this might be some kind of
signature management.
>> You know it's it's just outside the
range of of uh of you know visual range.
So, so, so, so, uh, the just to explain
to our audience, the the human eye has
got a very narrow field of what it can
see, visible light,
>> and your your cameras, the the flur
camera, the thermal camera, and the
hyperspectral camera, they can pick up
light bandwidths that we can't see with
the grade one a eyeball.
>> Exactly. Far a far bigger spectrum.
>> I mean, the visible range is anywhere
between about 400 to about 650
nanometers. Yeah, it's very narrow from
blue to red.
>> So, do you think this object was
disguising itself to avoid being seen by
the human eye?
>> I mean, behaviorally it would appear to
it appear like that that it was trying
to stay hidden.
>> Right. Right. I mean, it's uh you know,
this is not something you see on a
regular basis, especially something that
can just uh you know, go go well beyond
even near infrared and into more like
like a shortwave infrared, you know. So,
that's that's an extreme signature.
That's an extreme change. Not even
aircraft lighting at times, which does
offer a little bit of infrared uh can
can move up in in a range like that.
>> Sure.
>> And it's it's it's pretty close at this
stage because I think in your report you
say it was a luminous spherical object,
not visible to the human eye, but
visible on your cameras detected 140
yards. That's like 128 mters south off
the Robert Moses State Park beach
shoreline sitting on the surface of the
Atlantic Ocean.
>> Yes.
>> Was only visible through advanced um IR
night vision tech with no sound. I mean,
how was it propelling itself?
>> Uh that's a good question. [laughter] We
don't we don't know. So Russ, similar
occurrences were cited by the three of
us and other researchers back in the
2022 2023 period. Sometimes multiple orb
light luminous objects
>> and that's a good point that this is not
the first point. Yeah.
>> So that's really interesting, Donna. So
So this is a consistent thing that you
guys have been seeing over many years.
>> It was repeatable. Yeah. Yes. And this
is something too that uh Russ I just
want to point out that you had a guest
on recently
>> u from Nellis Air Force Base.
>> Yep.
>> That described uh something uh along the
fence line, you know, just uh along the
the the perimeter of a um the uh what is
it? The Nellis Air Force Base out there.
>> Yep.
>> Uh in the Nevada desert. and uh his
description that some of the
characteristics
uh agree with what he what he said uh as
far as his observation
>> Yoshua Shelton uh
>> exactly.
>> Yeah. I I found it fascinating because
in again in that case it does appear to
be signature management whatever these
objects are. Do do you think this object
that you saw on the 5th of July do you
think it was moving intelligently? Was
it manipul sort of maneuvering in a way
that was move clearly under some kind of
propulsion?
>> Yes, it was it was it was definitely an
intelligent control over it. It was
changing direction like I says was
stationary move to the east a ways and
then it made a turn towards the
shoreline back over the shorine. Right.
>> Let's explore the implications of that.
I mean I find that fascinating. So there
are objects that going from what Donna
has just said, it goes back two or three
years for you guys. You've been seeing
these consistently off this area for 3
years minimum. They are capable of
stealth signature management. They can
hide themselves from the human eye. The
luminous, self-propelled, intelligently
guided or
>> apparently.
>> Apparently, good qualification, Donna.
And and and how many times would you
have seen these objects?
I guess over the over a period of about
uh we've been out there four years now.
Uh we've probably seen these objects at
least uh I'd say a dozen times or so.
>> And have you reported I mean I I think
that in and of itself this is one of the
busiest airflight corridors in the
world. I mean this is the approach JFK
International Airport. I can imagine the
FBI has got every interest in ensuring
the safety of flight space and making
sure there's no national security issues
with um undetectable stealthy orbs
maneuvering in an area that's quite
sensitive. Was there an interest? Is
this being taken seriously? I mean, I
appreciate you can't talk about the work
that you've been doing with the FBI, but
can you assure us they are taking the
work that you're doing seriously? that
they're taking absolutely seriously.
>> Yeah, there's a genuine interest in this
stuff.
>> And that's now because back in 2022,
early 2023 when we were still involved
in phase one of the study and seeing
some of these types of phenomena, um I
was calling I was researching and
calling the u you know the Coast Guard,
all the various municipal layers, the
park uh government, the the police. I
was calling uh Homeland Security federal
as well as state and what I was getting
was if we were doing something in the
area one we wouldn't tell you. Other
people were saying well if we saw that
we would go have our heads examined and
then some people would Yeah. Exactly.
And some people even said because it was
during early 2023 this set of phone
calls. some some Coast Guard officials
said, "Well, uh, why don't you call Joe
Biden because he's just been shooting
them down the [laughter] Chinese the
Chinese balloons."
>> But that I mean that's that's a real
worry though, isn't it? I mean, what you
guys what what you have as citizen
scientists, you have discovered
something that is operating with
stealth, intelligently controlled
signature management outside the range
of visible light from the human eye. But
you say it's a three-dimensional
luminous object that is clearly
maneuvering intelligently. I mean, I I
don't understand why that's not a bigger
issue publicly.
>> You would think it would be. [laughter]
>> There is there was quite a bit of
attention on it though,
>> but the Yeah, the uh uh the FBI is quite
interested.
>> And and I think you've you had four
multisspectral electro optical infrared
cameras and you were able to eliminate
prosaic explanations. It wasn't a a a
buoy or a boy as we call them in
Australia. It wasn't a seagull. It
wasn't birds, bats, boat lighting. It
wasn't incoming passenger air traffic.
You were able to use and check ADSB
flight tracker to make sure it wasn't
that. It wasn't astronomical objects or
atmospheric turbulence. It wasn't lens
glares, reflections, bioluminescence,
miages.
None of those explanations work
prosaically.
>> No, they were quickly ruled out. And and
we routinely go to that checklist.
>> Yeah. And you're always at this time,
you're always checking both flight
tracker and satellite tracker and making
sure there's no boats on the water in
front of you.
>> Maritime maps, too. Yeah. Absolutely.
>> What do you think they are?
>> Uh we're not sure at this point. Um
they're they're certainly bizarre. Uh
the reason that they're out there is a
is kind of a mystery. It almost looks
like a um I don't know make some kind of
surveillance surveillance operations the
shores you know at first we thought
you know some resemblance
>> exactly we thought that there was some
resemblance to the the boog sphere also
uh even you know the way this this one
object presented itself.
>> Yeah.
>> It's funny you should mention that I'm
I'm going to be interviewing Patrick
Jackson who has a very interesting
theory. Yeah.
>> Um and and I I do think there is
something to this idea that everywhere
around the world, people are seeing
these metallic spheres or in some cases,
as you see, luminous orbs. And it is
reported consistently that these things
are capable of stealth management.
They're able to hide themselves from
visible light for the human eye. Um this
this fascinates me. Is is it a security
concern for the FBI? Are they taking it
seriously?
>> Absolutely. Absolutely.
>> Absolutely. I mean, this is an ongoing
uh uh it's an ongoing thing with them.
Um they're certainly very concerned
about it. Um and uh you know, our
communication is uh it's it's it's been
ongoing. Uh you know, we pretty much
present whatever we whatever our
findings are.
>> But Ross,
>> sorry, Donna.
>> Is it is it NHI or something along that?
Uh
>> well I mean the thing the thing that
worries me partnership testing of
technology
>> well it work through that.
>> Yeah. I mean if if it's if it's NHI
that's the that's the option that I
think is possibly the least concerning.
If it's an enemy, if it's a foreign
adversary with this kind of technology
that's capable of ISR, intelligence,
surveillance, reconnaissance that can
only be seen on hyperspectral infrared
or thermal cameras, then that's a real
worry. It implies that some foreign
adversary has a capability that I
suspect we don't have. Um, and
>> unless unless it truly is ours and
everyone is just
>> why would they test why would they test
technology like that on a beach in front
of John and Jerry Tedesco and Donna
Leonardo? I mean, seriously, [laughter]
>> these guys
worked with the FAA early on and the
Coast Guard uh Coast Guard to get uh the
radar permission to put together the two
radars that were in operation. that
tipped layers of government off that
such a study there would be people on
the beach after hours in the quiet of
the night for an extended period uh
serious uh researchers who were going to
be eyeing the sky uh looking for UAP or
similar objects. So to me uh my
background as an investigator that would
be the perfect time for me to uh put a
ruse into place uh and test technology.
That's just one idea. I'm not saying
that I'm leaning in that.
>> I but I I mean the the problem with that
theory though, Donna, is guinea pig.
>> Would they really want their technology
demonstrated as we're doing right now?
If if you're the US and you've developed
luminous spherical orbs that can only be
seen on hyperspectral or thermal or
infrared cameras, would you want that
being revealed by John and Jerry Tedesco
and Donna on the uh
>> figured it out? There are so many
questions and even Skywatcher, all the
other groups haven't figured it out
entirely either. And maybe they're using
what is coming forward to one day cloak
whatever the technology is entirely. And
wouldn't that be a great technology for
the US to have? It's just an idea.
>> I think the problem the one problem is
that then they have nobody told the FBI
about it.
>> Exactly. Or I can tell you the FAA, my
sources in the FIA don't know anything
about these so-called authorized
research drones that the White House has
referred to.
>> But remember compartmentalization.
As an investigator, I learned early on
you were in the beginning, I was told,
"Go here and tell me what you see." I
only knew one piece of it because they
wanted to lead me with breadcrumbs. And
that's what they do in the investigative
world. They don't tell you everything.
They they they lead you to see what you
say back one so they could be sure
you're where you are supposed to be. And
they also don't they want to
compartmentalize the operation. And so
that's something that I've
>> back of my mind.
>> Yeah. I think the bigger picture too
here is that this is presented
worldwide.
>> Yeah. You know, I mean this is multiple
countries are involved.
>> That's the most key. It's everywhere.
>> It's uh it's it's it's very difficult to
dismiss it even if it is a if it's a
certain entity that's doing it. Uh
whether it's US or or otherwise.
>> And then then why you know
in all these other places why? Well, I
I' I've got to congratulate you because
what you've got there is multiple
corroborated, multiple source data
evidence of something truly anomalous
because I I think what you record is it
goes up onto the beach, that same
object. And using some clever daytime
research, you've been able to figure out
that the object size, it's quite a small
object. How large do you think the
object was based on your
>> between uh one to between 1 to three
feet in diameter? probably closer to one
and a half to two feet.
>> And there's no noise at any stage.
You're not hearing a propeller. You're
not hearing a turbine. There's there's
nothing.
>> Not at all.
>> Nothing at all. It's really quiet.
>> Could it be a balloon? Dumb question, I
know. But could it be a balloon that was
just gently blowing ashore?
>> No. The balloon would be kind of
bouncing all over the place with with
the with those
>> Yeah. They'd be carried by it would be a
steady linear course.
>> Yeah. And this this thing was
independent of uh any kind of uh uh you
know wave action, water, that sort of
thing, the wind, you know,
>> it also was self self luminous.
>> It was counter to any of those.
>> Yeah, it was giving off its own light. I
mean, a lot of light. Exactly.
>> I I I don't understand. If it's self
luminous, that means it's got energy
somewhere inside it. How could its
thermal signature be lower than the
ocean?
>> Exactly. Exactly. And that's that's what
we've been questioning. It's uh you know
since since the beginning we've had a
very difficult time uh observing any of
these objects with the thermal camera
with with long wave longwave infrared.
Um and in this case we we believe that
the only reason why we did capture some
kind of a signature is because the sea
spray itself actually had a cooling
effect. Um but these objects I mean they
were a fraction of a degree cooler than
the water. You know it was a very you
know that's that's how we were able to
differentiate from everything else.
Anything in human technology that
generates energy like that would
necessarily be warmer than the sea water
around it. Surely
>> yeah sure I mean you can see boat lights
out there especially at the distance
that this thing was from the shoreline.
I mean uh the camera that we use is is
is a high resolution thermal camera with
30 times optical zone. You know this
stuff would have been very very easy to
to we would make out the thermal
signature of a boat hole.
>> Yeah.
>> Wow.
Let's keep on going because this there
this you know wait there's more from the
Tedescos. Um we've got 29th of August
another incident took place and this is
the one that really made me fall off my
chair. Let's call it the Black Triangles
incident. Talk me through it. What's
happening?
>> Okay, so uh so this occurred about 4
probably about 4:14 p.m. Uh I just had
gotten off work. I met John at his
place. We were in the RV running uh
tests on our equipment because we was
planning on going out that weekend,
>> August 29th.
>> Yes, August 29th.
>> Exactly. And this was Eastern time. And
it was uh we had just uh upgraded the
some of the spectrum analyzers on the RV
>> um on the uh the mobile lab. And uh
>> can you tell the audience what a
spectrum analyzer is?
>> Yes. So it's so this is uh this is
particularly used for uh radio
frequencies. Uh so we can scan out we
can look at anything from you know um
from about maybe a low frequency of 1
MHz all the way on up the spectrum to as
high as 26 gigahertz. Uh so this was
scanning and going through these test
routines and uh we noticed that we had a
signature there um that was um uh well
presented uh very unusual for the area.
Um and uh uh we kind of collaborated
that with the uh some radar data that we
had. Uh radar seemed to align with what
we had on the spectrum analyzer.
>> Where was the subject?
>> Um it was in the um the south uh west
sky
>> uh moving in an easterly direction
>> o over land in Long Island or over sea.
>> The the object itself was Long Island is
relatively narrow. you know, we're only
I think we're only about eight m eight
to 10 miles across
>> and um the object we believe was over
the water at that point simply because
of the distance that we were able to
capture on the radar.
>> Um it um it presented uh in a cloud
layer um exited a cloud layer, produced
a produced a signature. Let me let me
say one thing about the cloud layer.
This was a single thunderstorm cloud in
the sky. It was a nice the weather was
great.
Everything else was we had cumul clouds
out there mostly clear
>> and this was this was a dark cumul
nimbus cloud. It was a very dark
thunderstorm cloud and it looked out of
place
>> when we were looking at it.
>> As a matter of fact, it was the only one
we we had present.
>> Do you think I I I I'll say it because I
think you guys being scientists are too
careful. Donna knows what I'm going to
ask. Do you think that that cloud might
have been a fake cloud? So Gary Gary
Nolan when he came out with us for a
field study one night, he told us watch
for the cloud formations and John Jerry
and I saw one really nasty looking it
looked like 10 mother ships situated uh
oriented north to south one night when
we were doing the field study and I
believe this was early on in 2022 and it
also was a clear night but it just
looked out of place. It was dark. They
were lighted portions, but it was just
so humongous. And we always remember
that Gary had said, "Look at the cloud
formations."
>> Yeah, we definitely had some of these
out there. I' I've I've had people,
multiple people have sent me imagery.
There's quite famous ones on YouTube
where you see what looks like a cloud
and it's shaped just ever so slightly
like a disc or a craft and it it's got
the fluffy edges of a cloud and then it
suddenly maneuvers and just moves away.
And uh I I sometimes wonder whether
something or someone is using clouds as
a form of stealth or signature
management.
>> That's a that's a possibility. The the
other thing I would mention is uh and we
we look at that we look to see if it is
a cloud. We have we use um shortwave
infrared and which does pick up moisture
and it it'll actually differentiate the
the the wet the the precipitation in the
cloud or moisture in the cloud. So we
know it's we know it's is a real cloud.
>> What what did you do? Did you do that
with this cloud that night at the 29th
of August?
>> Exactly. Exactly. And this is something
that uh uh we could determine that uh
there was it wasn't it wasn't moisture
content.
>> It wasn't moisture.
>> So you were able to show it wasn't a
classic cumulo nimbus cloud even though
it looked like one.
>> Yeah. And and the object was well hidden
for a short period of time.
>> Uh actually relatively long period of
time before it emerged from the from the
cloud body.
>> So Donna is probably right. This this is
probably some kind of stealth
management. Some kind of intelligent
stealth management by something.
>> It's a possibility. Could very well be.
It could very well be.
>> Okay. Talk me through it. This is where
it gets really interesting. Talk me
through what happens next.
>> Okay. So So we we watched an object
emerge from the cloud on radar. John and
I quickly got our uh try went to get our
binoculars or we have what's called a
vortex vortex binoculars. These are
high-end binoculars grade optical glass.
Uh John had began looking at the cloud
with those and he he told me we both
went outside. I was trying to find one
of the other cameras uh scrambling
trying to get one of the other cameras
going and uh John said there's a black
object uh moving between the cloud and
then it was emerging from the cloud. So
he gave me the he gave me the uh I I
found one of my I grabbed my cell phone
and videotaped it while John was looking
at them. switched and uh what we saw was
something uh originally it resembled a
very black uh triangular or delta shape
to it or bell shape to it. It had a you
know it had that uh uh delta had that
delta shape or triangular shape.
>> And was this showing up on radar at this
stage? That delta shape.
>> Yes. Yes.
>> Yes. We did have a radar target.
>> We tracked on radar. on on radar, it
appears to separate into two more two
more objects, which is quite
interesting.
>> Now, you guys sneakily I giggled when I
saw it. I thought, "Oh my goodness me,
the Tedescos are deleting stuff." You
you you found something interesting in
the frequency and you can't talk about
it, can you? Has the FBI asked you not
to talk about it?
>> Yes, that's the sensitive part. There
was uh quite a bit of uh uh interesting
signals,
>> but uh I mean that goes into signal
intelligence with the uh
>> Okay, I'm going to throw it at you. Just
let me guess. 1.6 by any chance.
[laughter]
>> You've been talking to people.
>> No, no comment. [laughter]
>> No, it just fascinates me. The one is it
1.6 gigahertz or mehz? I'm trying to
remember. Gigahertz.
>> It's it's gigahertz. Yeah, there's I
know uh you know with the Skimw Walker
Ranch Yeah, I know there the one 1.6
seems to come up quite a bit. There's
also a 3 gigahertz signal supposedly. Um
>> there's a few others too.
>> Yeah, there's there's there's
>> We'll leave it at that.
>> Yeah. Yeah, there there are some stuff
that
>> No, but it's interesting. It's such a
consistent thing and I'm I'm really
interested because all around the world
people are contacting me talking about
1.6 in particular, but also about 3 GHz
and nobody's explaining it, but often
it's an indicator. And as you say, it
was a
without giving away the frequency that
you detected, you detected a frequency
anomaly on your spectrum analyzer, you
saw it there, then you got it on your
radar and then when you visually
observed it with the binoculars, the
vortex binoculars, you then corroborated
that object on the radar as well. So
you've got four separate data points to
corroborate something anomalous.
>> Yeah, exactly. and and a very very clear
visual representation of what was uh on
the radar. Uh the interesting thing I
will say that um we had observed flights
of uh commercial aircraft at the same
time uh through these lenses these these
very clear lenses that we use. Um the
commercial aircraft was extremely
detailed in focus. You can make out you
could even make out the writing on the
on the aircraft. the object itself. No,
>> it was always slightly out of focus for
some reason.
>> It was it was poorly poorly presented.
>> Okay.
>> And you you gents would understand, I'm
sure Donna as well, that the alcubia
drive principles that essentially if
something is coming, if it's warping
spaceime, there's allegedly some kind of
plasma or or some kind of distortion
field around the object.
>> Do you think that might explain what you
were seeing?
>> That's a possibility. Strong
possibility. It's something we're
looking into. There's also there was a
shimmer around it. Uh definitely uh a
possibility of some kind of field effect
around it.
>> Right. And this is something that we're
actually working with another group in
Canada that had just gotten a paper
published.
>> Yeah. Two other engineers
>> on the Alcubia principle with these with
these objects. Um which we believe is a
very very strong possibility. uh and it
kind of explains the visual presentation
of these objects is also the radar
anomalies that we've been getting the uh
the distinct interference patterns.
>> So you've presented on this data I I
think you recently gave evidence at a
Northwest US MUON 2025 symposium uh in
October. What was the reception? What's
the scientific reception? Are you
getting good peer review? Are people
trying to find prosaic explanations for
what you're offering here?
Um nothing that was addressed uh on the
objects we had seen, but there was a
there was a good uh there was a good uh
um group of people that were invited
there. I mean, they had uh Dr. Avi Loe
on there. They had uh Dr. Rudy uh Child,
I think his name is. Uh Frederick Ud
Doll, um uh
uh Dr. Keith Taylor, of course, he
presented with us, but there was a it
was a nice international representation
of researchers. What I love about this
is just in the last week of course we've
had Dr. Beatatus Viller's
extraordinarily interesting work with
the um geostationary orbit transients
that have now been accepted for peer
review.
You gentlemen are in a position I think
to publish are are you looking to
publish in a peer-reviewed journal the
work that you've done?
>> Yes. Uh we're we we're actually we we
we're have two peer-reviewed um uh
published data uh sets uh when we
originally out uh and then uh we
published a paper on these um on the um
long on these these interference
patterns we're getting on radar and
these long delay echoes
>> and we were uh uh suggesting the
possibility of a uh an an alier type
warp drive as a possibility. The the
thing that intrigues me about this 29th
August incident, the black triangle
coming out of the cumulo nimbus cloud or
apparently a cumulo nimbus cloud is you
also reported anomalies with your radar
tracking. Can you talk me through what
happened?
>> Yes. So um you know along with this
report you know this is the uh the radar
data that we got was was was very clear
uh for this particular object. Um most
of the time it's not you know you know
we get uh we get anomalies we get uh
very very strong interference pattern
sometimes um radar what looks like radar
jamming
um and uh uh very very distorted uh
reflections.
>> I I apologize I got it wrong. It's
actually the spectrum analyzer that you
suffered distortions on, isn't it? You
you were getting electrical interference
on your spectrum analyzer.
>> Uh were they anomalous? I mean obviously
there's a frequency that we're all aware
of that that indicates this kind of
anomalous phenomena.
>> Were you getting some kind of
interference pattern? Were you?
>> Yes, it's with these spectrum analyzers.
The the what the interesting thing about
this particular anomaly is that um it
seems to be uh a ground um
you know some kind of a ground
reflection. Um, I can't say, you know,
too much more than that, you know, other
than, you know, something that
it was
maybe not so directional, you know, um,
you know, it's a but but definitely an
oddity, something that, you know, a
radio spectrum engineer would have
picked out right away.
>> Right. And when you used the radar, you
actually used two radars, didn't you?
Did that help you triangulate? Were you
able to triangulate at all?
>> Absolutely. It's uh you know with the
with the two different scan geometries
that we use uh you know the vertical we
can get u an exact uh altitude
measurement. Um of course with the with
the Xband radar we can you know uh in a
360 degree uh loop or rotation we can uh
we can determine its you know its
directivity um and of course it's you
know it's its course of travel. So, this
is broad daylight. This is 4:39 p.m.
You're seeing on radar a slowm moving
solid radar return and it's coming up as
a white mass on your display. Um,
there's echo trails, which means the
object's moving. Did you get a speed?
>> The object's uh the object's speed was
um uh just over uh what was it, Joe?
200. I think we could clocked it in at
around just over 200 miles per hour at
that point.
>> Uh I'm not sure. I know it's on the
document. I can't Yeah, it's around I
thought it was like a It was a 100 uh It
might have been 200 miles per hour. 220
maybe 220.
>> Yeah, it was just over 220 maybe 225.
>> This isn't a balloon basically. It's
>> not a kite.
>> We We That's something we had looked
into was we uh uh checked the air
currents at that at that elevation and
there I think the wind speed was
probably about uh 14 miles per hour.
Yeah, between 14 and 16 miles per hour
with that.
>> I love you guys. Every time I ask a
question that might provide a prosaic
explanation, you're 10 steps ahead of
me. You've really done your homework. I
I I I just love it. It's great. Um you
you you basically see these things on
these Vortex 5000 binoculars and you
spot very clearly a black triangle. Can
you estimate the size of the object
based on the distance that you were able
to triangulate?
>> That was something that was more
difficult. Uh really couldn't determine
I don't think we were able to determine
the exact size.
>> Yeah, that uh you know we have some
estimations that um I mean it could have
been
>> uh you know it could have been the size
of a large automobile at that point. you
know it's uh but generally you know
anything I'd say um that uh was you know
within about 20 feet in diameter
>> but the the clearly important thing is
that there's nothing that can be
explained using the ADSB data. There's
no flights that are nearby that could
explain this object.
>> Not not with this object. There was no
correlation at all.
>> So what was it? I mean, you you're
seeing a black triangle hundreds of feet
in the air,
>> right?
>> I mean, what is it?
>> Yeah, this is uh this is the big mystery
and and it's we're not the only ones
that uh that observed this either. There
was another uh observation further north
uh up in New York um of a of uh
>> I think it was a a couple days later, a
day later,
>> actually a day later and somebody else
had had basically uh saw or observed
something very very similar.
>> Actually uh he he stopped he pulled off
from he was in traffic. He pulled off to
see at this person and he said it was a
black object that hovered um uh it
appeared to be hovering above a uh a
tree canopy and then dis when he drove
over to go see it get a closer look it
it had disappeared
>> right and visually visually it
definitely uh resembled exactly what we
similar
>> so let me summarize here you've got what
looks like initially a cumulo nimbus
storm cloud
>> you you're able with your radar to say
that it's not a storm cloud because it
doesn't have rain in it. There's no
moisture in it that the radar can bounce
off. So, while it looks like a cumulo
nimbus cloud, it ain't.
>> Yeah. Well, it would have been a very
strange one. [laughter]
>> And as
a you've been able to get a um a signal
on your spectrum analyzer indicating
which is without giving away the signal,
it's essentially indicative of
anomalousness. And and actually this is
on two spectrum analyzers.
>> Two spectrum analyzers.
>> Yes.
>> So that that's for the debunkers. You've
double corroborated it. Yes.
>> You then turn on your dualband marine
radars and you are corroborating a radar
return. Not only on the um cloud not
having moisture in it, but also a black
object that turns out to be triangular
shaped coming out of that cloud.
>> Exactly. Exactly. Redundancy is key on
>> right and and with these with these
radars Xband radar you know we have a
you know at at this particular frequency
we have a very very short uh wavelength.
So if you know if you wanted to track uh
like biomass birds that sort of thing uh
by sense you know setting up the
sensitivity of the radar you could
definitely track it. So we can see
moisture in the cloud layers. If there's
a significant amount of moisture, a
storm cloud, that sort of thing, we
would have picked that up right away.
>> And that wasn't showing up in around
right now. Yeah. No, that was
>> And what I do like about all three of
you is you are always looking for a
prosaic explanation. You're not you're
not you're not inclined to default to
the UFO aliens explanation.
But but the the interesting thing about
this object is even though you're able
to zoom in with your vortex binoculars
on an aircraft that's at 19,000 ft and
see it clearly with those binoculars,
when you zoom in on this black triangle,
you can't get focus.
>> Not at all. Not at all. And that that's
that's the key difference there. All we
could tell is that it looked like it
changed its orientation in flight
because the edges would change. The
edges looked like it would change.
almost like it was morphing but I I kind
of think we kind of feel it was it was
changing its orientation
>> right and and if there is something to
this alqbia principle this this uh
gravitational lensing that's that's
occurring I mean this would be a really
solid explanation as far as why these
things are not well observed you know
>> I know I know somebody had mentioned
that we were making assumptions on that
but we have uh we're we're our data our
opinion is based on several data points
it's not just a single data point,
>> right? And this is something that you
know this it's a it's a discovery over
many many different observations.
>> And and just just talk me through it.
When when you say gravitational lensing,
what are you actually physically seeing
through the binoculars?
>> So the there's there's there appears to
be some kind of a uh a some kind of a a
pattern of distortion around the object
>> almost like a almost like a shimmer,
>> right? And and sometimes this can be
also be be picked up in a in a in a
thermal camera. You know, you'll you'll
see there are there are definitely
differences from the environment around
it. Uh temperature differences.
>> Um
>> uh the mechanism for that, I'm not quite
sure because it doesn't, you know, if
you looked at a plane with the same
signature, uh you know, you wouldn't see
anything that would be remotely close to
what these things are producing.
>> Um
>> can I ask you this?
the moment that the object moved out of
the cloud.
>> Is there any connection between when
that object made that movement and when
you switched on your dualband radar?
>> Yeah. So, we actually tracked the the
object. We tracked the cloud, believe it
or not, and we could see we could see
there was a uh a physical manifestation
within the cloud itself. And uh that's
the one thing that, you know, uh got our
interest. And we we you know we walked
outside. We were looking up and we said
this is the only cloud uh that looked
different from from everything else out
there and it was in the same location.
Uh it it pretty much agreed that lined
up with the radar target and uh over a
period of minutes this object started to
uh
>> emerge
>> emerge from the cloud layer.
>> It didn't take long before we saw
something. So basically the moment you
switched on your dualband marine radar
and started scanning that cloud, that's
when there was a reaction.
>> Exactly. Exactly.
>> Wow. This just gets better and better.
And and when you watch the object depart
the cloud, it's flying at at least 100
to 200 miles an hour. So it's flying
faster than the wind. Uh it it's clearly
under some kind of intelligent
directional control and propulsion. Do
you hear any engine or is it too far
away for you to hear anything?
>> Uh, we we should have heard something.
There was completely quiet though.
>> Right. Right. And and living as close to
the airport as as you know, this is this
is my residence and you know, I'm I'm
literally uh two miles from from the
local airport there. It's uh you know,
MacArthur airport. So, you know, I see
aircraft coming in and out all the time.
you know, and I, you know, I've seen
plenty of them to to to realize when
they present soundwise, you know, the
distances, what they look like, you
know, and and various different
presentations. Uh, this this object uh
certainly didn't align itself with
anything.
>> This stood out as very strange.
>> Okay. So, we've done two objects now in
your list. There's one more to go, but
clearly
something
demonstrably anomalous in each of these
examples
>> is is operating intelligently
and appearing to be conducting.
You're looking at it, but it's looking
at you.
>> It's doing ISR. It's it's surveilling
you.
That's the interesting thing because the
fact that it appeared where we were and
the fact that sometimes they seem to
appear directly in front of us or or
where we move our location is quite
interesting. And Jerry and I were just
speaking before this meeting how
sometimes he'll have an impulse to look
and I have had an impulse to open my eye
sometimes in the middle of the night and
sometimes it's it's like we're being
summoned and we just instantaneously
look and see.
>> Now people might scoff at what you're
saying, Donna, but I've I've actually
seen that happen. I've I've had people
who are purportedly of psionic ability
say to me, "You're going to see
something. You're going to see something
tonight or you're going to see something
this evening and it's going to look like
this and it's happened." Uh have do you
think that whatever the phenomenon is,
it's manifesting itself to you?
>> That that's an that's a really
interesting
>> communicating.
>> Yeah. Because each one of us have had uh
you know what we call this hitchhiker
effect. Each one of us has seen
something after being out there a while.
>> And this predates the study though, but
is more so now since the study.
>> Yeah.
>> Does that freak Does that not freak you
out a little bit, Donna? The idea of
these objects following you home?
>> Absolutely not. One time you said on the
show when John and Jerry were showing
you a video, was that Donna that I heard
saying, "I hope we don't get taken." No,
we were out there saying, "We want you
to come here. We want, you know, I want
to be with them when they have another
close encounter and we want to be taken.
We want that. We want that experience
because what better way to research this
phenomena than to become a part of it
like that.
>> Well, make sure you bring
>> We're not scared.
>> Make sure you make sure you bring back
John and Jerry the plans for the alub.
[laughter]
>> John and I have a different John and I
have a different attitude. We we don't
want to be
>> That's [laughter] not true. John was
very brave. He he also wanted to be
taken.
>> Okay, so let's let's go to the fourth
case, 4th of July. And I I I guess a lot
of people as soon as they hear the the
date 4th of July, they're going to say,
"Look, this was fireworks or it was some
kind of Chinese lantern."
>> But on the 4th of July, um uh Sharon
Tedesco, uh who's whose wife was that?
Yours, John, or
>> Jerry? That's Jerry. That's me.
>> Yeah. U Sharon saw a large luminous
object. Um, tell me more what happened.
>> Uh, yes. This was in the, uh, I think it
was the south towards the southwestern
sky. We look at a fireworks display out
there. Um, it's towards the, uh, it's a
Farmingville area of, uh, Long Island.
Um, but it was probably close to 8:00 at
night. Um, she saw a a light that was
she at first she thought it was a
firework, but then the light was heading
towards it coming in our direction and
she tapped me on his shoulder and she
says, "Doesn't that look weird?" So, I
looked at it says, you know, it's
probably a plane. I waited until it got
a little closer. Uh, didn't notice any
navigation lights. Noticed it was uh it
was it was very red, fiery red. Um, as
it got closer, uh, we took our cameras
out. Both me I took out my, uh, my cell
phone. I have good camera system on the
cell phone. My wife took out her digital
camera and we both filmed it as it went
um, more over towards towards the
zenith, but off to the right of us where
we were parked.
>> And so this is over land in
Farmingville, New York.
>> Yes, it was this was over land. And
>> ju just a devil's advocate, I think you
actually acknowledged in the report that
you wrote to me, you you you
acknowledged very candidly that there
was a fireworks display at Farmingville,
New York. Could this
>> could this have been fireworks or a
Chinese lantern?
>> Uh no, this was uh self this was
self-propelled. Uh and it uh it was the
lighting on it was as bright as an uh
probably brighter than an airliner. an
airline, you have 600 watt lights on it.
This was probably brighter than 600
watts, but the light, you know, the
light didn't hurt your eyes, but it was
a a bright red object with an uh orange
orange interior. The center of it was
more white.
>> Um, as it went overhead, I saw what
looked like um borders or divisions on
the bottom of it, which I couldn't quite
make out.
>> You described some kind of structure
underneath.
>> Yes. It looked like it was a uh divided
structure. Um probably some some parts
more more um uh were embossed or or they
were raised. So
>> any noise?
>> Uh no noise at all. Completely quiet. H
>> how high was it off the ground? Would
you have expected to have heard it if it
was propellers or a turbine?
>> Uh I estimate it would be between 500
to,000 ft off the ground. Probably
close.
>> So you should have heard it if it was
props.
>> Oh yeah, absolutely.
And this was probably about the size of
a probably a small car, the size of a
car.
>> Was it cylindrical?
>> It had an oval shape to it when it went
over. But as it passed us, it assumed a
round very spherical shape. And in the
videos and in the photographs, uh, I
mean, if you look at those, you could
see that it was emitting some kind of
vapor, uh, trail a trailing vapor as,
uh, opposite the direction it was
headed. It was headed north towards
another fireworks display. It made a
slight turn to the right and then I lost
uh we lost sight of it.
>> And then but it was interesting thing is
the same thing repeated again with
another object or the same object taking
the same path just minutes later.
>> So what was it? What what's your theory
about what it was?
>> Um I have no idea. This is very it was
uh very strange looking. It did look
like some of the fireball like orbs we
were seeing uh off the coast from time
to time. Right.
>> But this was I I this one I had a much
closer view of it.
>> Right. I think there were I think there
was another witness further north also.
Yes. That saw the same or similar
object. So, um I did reach out to the uh
FBI of course I they have a report uh we
did talk um they had gathered a report
from New Fork uh which tracked uh and
tracked another witnesses further up
north upstate New York which would have
been the same path uh this object took
going north.
>> It was an area called Burn Hills, New
York. Can you just explain to me I I I
know why, but just for the benefit of
our audience, why is the FBI uh as a
federal law enforcement agency taking
such a close interest in the issue of
unidentified objects hovering in secure
airspace in and around New York, New
Jersey? What's what's the issue for the
FBI?
>> Their p their primary issue is uh
national security. Is it a safety
concern? Who's flying them? And the fact
is nobody knows who's flying them,
including the FBI,
>> right? And and that it's still their day
jobs are still domestic, you know.
>> And it's funny because that's the thing
that I don't understand is why the news
media in the main has bought into the
explanation that all of this was just
hysteria. Um, I mean there's no I
noticed that a well-placed article in a
Stoge Journal, the Wall Street Journal
recently suggested that the whole drones
flap was just a hysterical reaction to
known aircraft. And the same line's been
pedal for all of the sightings across
Western Europe, Denmark, Norway, France,
Germany. Um, there's been pushing of
this line that essentially the public's
just got hysterical and misguidedly seen
things that weren't real when in fact
they're just perfectly explainable as
prosaic objects. Aircraft, balloons,
drones.
In summation, what you're saying here is
you've picked up three highly anomalous
objects that are not conforming to
prosaic explanations. Agree.
>> Exactly. Absolutely.
>> Absolutely agree.
>> Is the obviously the intensity of the
objects that were being seen over New
Jersey in particular in that period
October, November last year into
January, February this year,
the intensity and frequency of those
objects has lessened. But is it fair to
say that you're still seeing anomalous
objects in and around the New Jersey
Long Island area? Yes. And there are
other reports as well, especially in the
New Jersey area.
>> Yeah.
>> You know, not from us. So, it's it is
ongoing. It's hard to tell what they're
seeing right now. Is it the same type of
sky phenomena as last year and earlier
this year?
Not sure about that. And one of the
things that fascinated me with the
Europe objects and I've spoken directly
to people in the security services in
Norway and they've told me that they
were not able to see where these objects
came from or went to. Often they
literally just appeared over over a
secure civil aviation area. So like a an
aer drrome or a major runway. Uh is that
what you're seeing? Are you able to
track these objects to and from?
>> That's very consistent. Most of the time
when we see these objects, they just
appear. They suddenly appear. We don't
see the source of where they're coming
from or where they're going. They they
seem to appear and then disappear,
>> which implies very strongly, doesn't it,
that they're using this stealth
management that you've referred to
earlier. They're able to in some cases
keep themselves off radar and out of
sight of the visible spectrum for the
human eye.
We we believe that. Yeah.
>> Exactly. And and the other thing too is
you know again I go back to this
differentiating you know what we're
seeing you know I you know I think folks
just put everything together you know
whether it's you know these drone-like
objects and which seem to have a a time
frame when they present in some cases.
Um and then we have these these orb
looking objects that seem to be present
all the time. you know, that just
they're just out there. Um, and you
know, that that's why our rationale, our
reasoning was that, you know, that this,
you know, maybe this is some kind of a
surveillance operation, you know, of of
these drones, uh, because, uh,
>> the drones of these objects
>> of the objects, the drones being used
for these for these objects and and of
course the there's some stealthy
technology for the drones, too, that we
don't really understand.
>> And that that raises questions about who
the source of the of these drone-like
objects are. And it could be something
uh could be something out there. You
know,
>> Gabeski Airport on Long Island, eastern
end. Uh you had John and Jerry on your
show right after that mini flap. So,
somebody was sending up um Suski
helicopters because one came very close
to my house. I've never heard such a
thunderous noise before. It was in the
midst of that flap. John and Jerry had
been out at Chikabuski airport just a
few days before and I went to the app to
check ADSB to see what was in the
vicinity and I didn't see anything yet
but then by the next day when I was able
to check again I was able to confirm
that what I saw and heard and I opened
my front door and I felt like I could
reach out and touch it and I s what I
saw was it looked like a moving train
because it was that massive and I saw a
red and green light on the back but I
saw this big to To me, I would say it
was round white, brilliant light on the
front, but it was so big, but it was so
close and so thunderous. And when I did
some research on YouTube, what do black
helicopters look like at night? What do
they sound like? I was kind of
disheartened because I was hoping that
that big round orb type of uh phenomena
I saw on the front towards the front was
really the helicopter chasing this orb.
But as it turns out, and I only had I
didn't have my uh night vision camera. I
was just looking my eyes. What ended up
being potentially I think is that people
say that these Blackhawk helicopters,
they do put on sometimes when they're
working together one or two, they'll put
on the the front lights and then it it
it will have that rounded very bright
look. But the thing is, my main point
about this is Greski airport was
concerned enough to have black
helicopters up and this was right around
the same time as the New Jersey uh flap,
>> right? And at that time they had a large
number of those
>> and this helicopter came from airport. I
was able to track it came from Greski
airport uh went down to the Atlantic
Ocean a little bit out east from where
we are now. And then it it headed back
towards like north of my area. so close
to where we are now. Then headed south,
went right by one of the main streets
near my home, which is why I could hear
it so well and looked out and could it
looked like I could reach out and touch
it. It was so massive, but I couldn't
see the black part, right? I couldn't
see the the shell of the airplane. I
only saw lights. And then it went out
east and went again to the uh Atlantic
Ocean and then went near Dawn's house.
It went to uh around Macarthur Airport
and I don't know what it did then. it
circled back someplace else. But
something was going on and it's not just
as you said it's Europe, it's New
Jersey.
>> And and just just to add to that is when
we had the observation with the the
Black Triangle, uh we had ADSB data that
showed uh a number of uh uh Sakorski
aircraft tracking along the coast during
that time that we observed the uh the
Black Triangle. Um, interestingly
enough, when we went to do a replay,
those aircraft were no longer there.
They weren't they weren't recorded. And
uh uh
>> so you saw them in real time on ADSB,
but they were taken off the the data
subsequent.
>> You have the data stream later, recorded
data stream later, they were no longer
there. It appears that it might have
been trying to follow this thing. Yeah.
>> Wow.
>> The plot just gets thicker and thicker.
I mean the the thing is I've learned now
not to accept the official assurances
that this whole drone flap was hysteria
because from the evidence that you guys
are collecting it's quite clear there is
an ongoing legitimate scientific mystery
and full marks to full marks to the
three of you for pushing for answers.
I'm so delighted to hear that the FBI is
taking this seriously. Can I ask you
both without giving away the essentially
the the details if you like of the FBI
investigation, what do you think they're
going to do with this data that you're
providing them?
>> Oh boy. Um I I I know they're trying to
find answers. They're trying to
understand what it is.
>> Yeah, we know they're serious about
finding answers to it.
>> You know, I'm not quite sure that they
they they there is a full understanding
as far as what, you know, what it is,
what they're dealing with. Um, I think
that's I think that's the part of the
problem.
>> So, why are we being gaslit? Why are the
public being told that they were
hysterical, that these were prosaically
explainable objects that it was just
nonsense? The these were drones or they
were, you know, people responding to
speculation.
Why are we being gaslit like that when
it's quite clear the authorities still
have no idea what these objects were or
are?
>> But I I think the public helped make
that happen. It played right into
government's hands. They want to secret
things. They don't want things out in
the public potentially, no matter what
it is, whether it's NHI or a secret
program of some kind. And so by by the
public giving attention to people's
sightings and then more and more
sightings and then the local governments
send out vehicles and then the federal
government sends out vehicles and then
the government is able to sit back and
say, "Well, see, it's just a a flap, a
non no a nonsense flap, and the public's
going crazy. That's just a regular
helicopter. That's just a regular
plane." And so we the whole notoriety of
the these situations plays into the
government's hand and then they could
sit back and say it was nothing and then
we get no further into finding out what
it could have been. I
>> I'll tell you I think it's very
insulting to the public to accuse them
of being that stupid not to be able to
recognize a plane. New Jersey has a lot
of air traffic. People see air traffic
all the time. They didn't just suddenly
become confused about what they were
seeing in the skies.
>> Exactly. Yeah. And
>> and that's exactly that's exactly what a
policeman from New Jersey said to me
only two days ago. I I asked I asked a
local policeman in New Jersey, "Are you
still seeing anomalous objects?" And he
went, "Absolutely. They've never gone
away."
>> And they've been frustrated. The
sheriff's department over there were
frustrated that they weren't being
heard.
>> The government was ridiculing the size
of a car, right? We heard that a lot
about New Jersey. Can does the public
can they differentiate between something
that is bigger or smaller than the size
of a car
>> if it's low enough? Yeah.
>> Yeah. Yeah. And there's certain
reference markers too in some cases, you
know, I know there's a there's a sheriff
out in uh was it
>> or or Nebraska
Chris Grooms? Chris Grooms that was able
to reference u you know a building
>> uh where this object seemed to be very
very in close proximity and he was able
to you know give a size and so forth of
the object. Was there was there anything
about that building that was
distinctive? Because that was my next
question I was going to wrap up and ask.
>> Are you able to find a nexus between
where these objects appear to be
conducting their ISR, their intelligence
surveillance and reconnaissance and
anything on the ground? Because of
course during the New Jersey flap, it
was the Pikatini Arsenal where obviously
a lot of ordinance is stored in
including I guess quite possibly nuclear
weapons. Um uh is there something on the
ground that links to whatever these
objects might be taking an interest in?
>> Well, the interesting thing is uh Lauren
has uh Brook Haven National Laboratory
>> and this is like this is the uh the
second biggest uh uh uh nuclear
accelerator uh ring test facility.
>> Yeah.
>> In the United States besides the one in
California.
>> So where the black triangle was, how far
away was Brook Haven?
>> Uh within four miles. Yeah.
>> Wow.
>> Yes. Absolutely.
>> Interesting coincidence. So guys, I
would be remiss if I didn't ask you on
behalf of my producer, colleague, and
friend Megan Orda, who was in Santorini,
Greece when she saw an orb recently that
she told me about on the latest Q&A. I
was I would be remiss if I didn't ask
you about your take on what Megan
describes of what she saw. Do you have a
view or a response?
>> Sure. We were fascinated by it. We we
actually heard that uh that broadcast,
>> right? And and when she the way she
described it, uh it sounds like exactly
what one of our researchers observed not
too far from his house and he actually
had a a recording of it um which we uh
presented to Megan. We had sent it over
to her um and I and I believe that she
uh looked at it and said that uh uh it
looks very very similar to what what she
observed. So, describe to me what your
colleague saw and what you think Megan's
seeing. Like, what is it? Is is this
something similar to the luminous orb
you've just told us about?
>> Yes.
>> Yes. This was um uh we actually had him
he he actually called us one night and
he was he was he was super excited about
something and and we asked him what what
was going on. He says, "Can I come over
right now to show you guys something?"
We said, "Sure." You know, we met at the
the at the Nightcrawler and uh he
brought the uh memory stick of his from
his uh his his IR binoculars and what he
filmed was an object that he says it
looked like he's he's an astronomy buff
so he looks at this the sky often. He
saw three stars in the sky and he
thought there were stars. He says two of
them scattered, one dropped, and the one
that dropped headed towards his house.
And he says before it it uh before he
knew it, it was it was just above the
treetops. He ran as quick as he could to
get his night vision binoculars and he
filmed it going across the tree lines.
So, is he seeing it with his own a grade
1 a1 eyeballs or is it only visible with
>> He was able to see this with his eyes
and and of course with the IR camera.
>> So, just like Megan did, she saw it with
her eyeballs hovering over the ocean at
Santorini. Um, and some people have
described to me that these orbs, they've
almost got like a yoke, a a kind of a a
middle sphere in the middle of them.
>> Right. Right. And it's it's a perfect
sphere, too. There's there's a a very
defined outline around this this object.
Um it um it has a it's not it's not well
defined, but it's gives off white light.
uh the way she described it and um the
video that that that we have with with
what he had recorded, the object
basically um had moved like Gerald was
between uh between trees and he was you
could see him rushing around
running off to the side of his house
trying to capture this thing and you
could see as it was moving across the
sky and then suddenly the object just
faded out. It it completely faded out.
It it was like wasn't even there.
>> And interestingly, he wanted to film
there was a full moon out. He wanted to
film the moon to show us that there was
two that it wasn't the moon, that it was
two different objects and this thing was
almost the size of the moon,
>> right? If you were observing the full
moon at that time, if you know, visually
it was almost the same size.
>> So, you can't think of any prosaic
explanation for what either Megan saw or
for what your colleague saw?
>> No. And she's seeing pretty much what
we've been seeing off the coast of uh
Long Island. And then and that's pretty
common is these orbike objects.
>> Well, that just that just underlines
that what we are seeing, what we're
describing, what people are seeing all
over the world is truly an international
phenomenon. It's it's not something
localized.
>> Absolutely. And and like I said, and
some of these objects will present in
such a way that they're they're they're
welldefined. They they give off a um uh
almost like a uh like a kaleidoscope
appearance of color and you'll see very
defined blues and reds in here. And uh
you know you know we're looking at that
we're saying this is we believe it's
some kind of gravitational lensing
that's causing it. You know where as the
object rotates towards you it's blue
shifts and it rotates away it goes to a
red shift. So you're implying you're
you're implying you think it's NHI.
>> That's what we believe it either that or
some very sophisticated technology
>> that maybe a reverse engineering.
>> Nobody's sharing yet.
>> But it's certainly it's certainly
anomalous what you're seeing.
>> Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. This is not
something I mean you could see you'll
you know you'll see a glinting star that
sort of thing you know a shimmer to it
but nothing that presents as these
objects do with this this incredible uh
chromemer uh display.
>> Yeah it's a full chromatic display of
colors as it does rotate. They rotate.
>> And do you think I just wonder do you
think it was entirely coincidence that
Megan and her husband are the ones that
saw it? Do you think it sought her out
because it knows who she is and what
she's been doing? I mean, am I pulling a
long bow here?
>> Well, we are seeing a pattern of people
uh who take an interest in this getting
whether it's imprinted on them or or
whatever way they they uh maintain this
this psychical link.
>> And it sounds like it was relatively
close to you know uh I mean the way she
described it, it sounds like the object
was you know within a quarter of a mile
from from you know where she was viewing
it. It's intriguing, isn't it? That idea
that the phenomenon may well be trying
to twig the awareness, the consciousness
of people that are taking an interest in
it.
>> Could very well be. Could be some kind
of entanglement. I don't know.
>> Well, it raises more questions than it
answers. Donna, Leonardo, John, and
Jerry Tedesco of the Nightcrawler team.
I take my hat off to you guys once again
for providing us with compelling,
insightful, corroborated data that I
think adds to the mystery of whatever
these phenomena are. Thank you so much
