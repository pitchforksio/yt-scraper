Good day and welcome back to Reality
Check Q&A where you get to ask me the
hard questions. It's the time of the
week I fear the most. There's always
some curly question that puts me on the
back foot and here to ask them, my
friend and colleague, producer Megan
Order. Good day, Megan. How are you
today?
>> Great Ross. How are you? Very well.
Very, very well. Fire away. Let's hit me
with some of those excoriating
questions.
>> All right, we will start with Rod who's
got some comments about NASA. Dear Ross,
recently Dr. Gregory Rogers, a former
NASA chief flight surgeon and Air Force
major, has given public testimony
detailing an event from 1992 where he
claims he was shown CCTV footage of a
craft he described as a quote flying
saucer inside a hanger at Cape
Canaveral. Most remarkably, he states,
"The craft bore a US Air Force
insignia." However, his story has
received surprisingly little in-depth
coverage compared to other
whistleblowers. My question for your Q&A
is, would you consider investigating his
claims further and potentially
interviewing him?
>> You're absolutely right. Uh I his story
is important. I met Dr. Gregory Rogers
very briefly at Contact in the Desert in
May this year. He's a lovely bloke and I
find him very persuasive. I heard him
speak and I think the story he tells is
very important and frankly anyone of his
stature I mean he was a former chief
surgeon or such like for NASA at Cape
Canaveral that's a very senior position
the fact that he's willing to speak out
and say what he saw says an enormous
amount and basically my my one issue
with what he says is he's not saying he
saw directly a craft
He's saying he saw CCTV of a craft,
which is the point, you know, a very
very important point because a lot of
people, a lot of debunkers and skeptics
have suggested that he was just shown a
fake video or that, you know, how can he
be certain that what he saw was real?
I'm
reasonably confident that there are such
craft being operated using US Air Force
insignia. And the reason why I believe
Dr. Rogers is because of what I've been
told by a source who frustratingly won't
go on camera, but who did tell me a
story about what he saw at Eglund Air
Force Base in Florida. And uh it was
very very similar. It was a gigantic
um elliptical craft, massive, apparently
uh 20 30 m wide, hovering in a clearing
at Eglund Air Force Base, clearly being
attended to by both unformed and suited
men. Uh, and in the moment that he was
standing there looking at it as he was
having a a covert cigarette, uh, hidden
away from view, he literally saw the
object blink from sight. Literally, he
blinked and it disappeared. It was that
fast. It It disappeared. There was a
momentary shutter of the trees,
presumably by the displacement of air
underneath the object. But whatever it
was, it was some kind of craft using a
propulsion system that we know not what.
Uh, which was being operated at a US Air
Force base in Florida. So, I I've got
enough data points to tell me that what
people like Dr. Gregory Rogers are
saying is accurate. And I do think that
we need to start taking these
allegations seriously. the possibility
that the United States is operating
ARVs, alien reproduction vehicles. Um, I
cite also the Mike Herrera story where
Michael Herrera, a young US Marine, was
on a patrol in Indonesia during a
civilian uh crisis and evacuation during
a disaster and he came across a craft
hovering in a clearing that was clearly
being protected, guarded by paramilitary
US accented military personnel. They
weren't very friendly to him either. Um,
so why do I take Dr. Gre Rogers
seriously? Because there is a plethora
of information to suggest that there's
something to this. Um, yeah, at some
stage I'd love to get Dr. Rogers onto
reality check. I guess what I'd like to
do is take the story further. Um, we we
try on the program to report what's
being reported and I do think it's
important to acknowledge good men like
Dr. Rogers who've come forward and given
their evidence. But when they've been as
he has been, he has actually been fairly
widely interviewed across a whole
breadth of different podcasts and shows.
I'd like to try and find a new angle and
we try we always try and find a new way
into the story and I've got one in mind
and at some stage I might bring him on.
>> Okay, we will go next to an email from
Jeppy. Hello, thank you for your hard
work on the UFO subject. Have you tried
C5 contact yourself? If so, how many
times? And have you gotten any results?
I was able to get results by myself
after a few failed attempts. But after
that, it became quite easy. It became
quite easy and common. I would recommend
Greer C5 protocol, which is quite simple
and easy to learn.
Okay. C5, for those of us who don't
know, is close encounters of the fifth
kind where purportedly using meditative,
telepathic, psychical techniques, one is
able to get oneself into a position
where you can invite perhaps summon a
non-human intelligence or craft or orb
or whatever it is to come into your
view. And have I done it? I've certainly
tried it. I haven't done it
successfully. In fact, I've been a
miserable failure. But I certainly have
witnessed it. I've witnessed it now
twice. Um, I saw it only about probably
seven or eight weeks ago in Northern
Victoria at a place called Ruther Glenn
in a place called Ga Sanctuary run by an
Australian called Peter Maxwell
Slatterie. And um, it's quite funny
actually. Peter said to me during the
daytime, he said, "I've got a feeling
we're going to see stuff tonight." And
we were standing in darkness looking out
probably to the west from his beautiful
property. And as we were standing there,
he was meditating and inviting them to
come. And he he's done a lot of work
like this at Mount Chester in
California. And I was skeptical to be
perfectly honest. And maybe my
skepticism is part of the problem. But
as I watched, there were clearly dots
that became orbs that moved closer and
closer towards us. In some cases,
hovered just behind trees, probably no
more than a few hundred feet in front of
us. And I can't explain it. They were
moving erratically. They weren't
satellites. They weren't planes. They
weren't drones. They weren't fireflies.
They weren't birds.
there was some kind of object that
appeared to respond intelligently to
Peter's invitations for them to come
closer. And on a couple of occasions
when he invited them to pulse up, that
was the kicker for me. Um, they
literally flashed.
I can't explain it. And I've seen the
same thing before. I think I've talked
about this before at which is just down
the coast from San Francisco. a
beautiful place if you ever get the
opportunity to visit. It's a serene
location sitting on the Pacific Ocean
high above the Pacific Ocean run by um
uh a lot of beautiful people who spend
their days meditating and thinking about
spiritual things. It was a privilege to
be invited there and um I was there with
one of the psionics who's been now
involved with Skyatcher and he actually
said to me at 4:00 in the afternoon
while it was still daytime. He said,
"Ross, we're going to see a blue orb
tonight." And he even predicted it might
be hexagonal or octagonal. I think he
said hexagonal.
Anyway, literally later on that night we
did. We saw a blue orb. Hundreds people
saw a blue orb hovering near a swimming
pool where a lot of people were swimming
naked and um it was right adjacent to
the Pacific Ocean and as people watched
it sank down onto the beach and you
could clearly see the blue
phosphorescent hexagonal shaped orb
sitting on the beach. Um, I can't
explain it, but whatever it was, the
person who summoned it told me that we
were going to see it, and we did.
>> Okay, Ross, we will go to an email from
David. Ross, could the secrecy
surrounding this phenomenon be
associated with the potential
manipulation of human DNA? If non-human
entities walk among us and have altered
our genetic makeup, it raises the
question of whether certain human
populations may might possess a higher
proportion of nonhuman DNA than others.
If this were the case, disclosure of
such information could risk fueling
eugenic ideologies or race-based
conflict, potentially dividing humanity
rather than uniting it. What do you
think?
Okay, there is no hard scientific
evidence, I'm told, to support the idea
that there has been manipulation of the
human genome. And it's interesting
because I've read scientific papers that
make this assertion which some of which
I think might have been peer-
reviewviewed. I mean there was a couple
of years ago I got very excited because
there was one paper that was published
in Eastern Europe which suggested that
there were
um DNA strands in the human genome that
genome that appeared to show some kind
of manipulation. And I asked Professor
Gary Nolan about this and he poo pooed
it and said he didn't think there was
much to it. So officially at least
science says that there is no evidence
of manipulation any artificial
manipulation of the human genome. But as
many who follow the UAP subject will
know it's a long known allegation that
NHI whatever they are beings from other
areas have been manipulating the human
genome and possibly hybridizing humans
with alien DNA. I've never been able to
see any evidence to support this. Um
there's a friend of mine here in
Australia called Bill Chalker who's a
reputable scientist who's done some
great work in a book called The Hair of
the Alien. And um he uh interviewed a
gentleman called Curi who claimed to
have actually been forcibly
made to have sex with two Nordic women
who turned up in his bedroom. And the
interesting thing about this incredible
story is that um they found a hair from
one of these alleged beings which when
tested showed all manner of
extraordinarily
um weird DNA. Whatever it was, it wasn't
entirely normal human DNA. Um there's
been an interview done by a friend of
mine called Rhys Delton Morgan uh which
basically tells this whole story and you
can go on and have a look at that. Rhys
Dton Moore. Um,
as for the claims of ancient genetic
engineering, yes. Okay. There are
claims, the ancient astronauts theory
that posit that extraterrestrials, the
anunnaki from Samrian days, genetically
altered early hominids like Homo erectus
to create homo sapiens as a labor force.
And this has been popularized in
different shows and books, but
essentially there's not a lot of
evidence to support it. How do you prove
something like this? You know, there's
obviously claims that have been made by
witnesses about such types of genetic
manipulation, but really um uh I was I I
did some reading about this recently.
There was a um a preprint preprint by a
molecular biologist called Max Mayer
Kashev Remple and he analyzed 581 family
DNA trios from the thousand genomes
project and he alleged that
approximately 2% showed non-parental
insertions
um large hapletype swaps on chromosome
three, which were inexplicable by
natural means or inexplicable by pre990
human tech such as crisper, which does
allow gene manipulation. And he made the
assertion that this linked to alien
manipulation
uh including pilot data from
self-reported abductee families. Now,
his claims have also been attacked and
debunked and skepticized. So, frankly, I
don't know what to think. If anyone has
any hard evidence of alien
hybridization,
I'm your man. Send it my way.
>> Ross, naked people swimming in pools and
group Nordic sex. This episode's getting
kind of crazy.
>> Sounds like fun, doesn't it?
>> Yeah, I thought this was a family show,
but um can't wait to see the comments on
this one. Thanks a lot. Um here comes
Tim in our email. Dear Ross, thanks for
your work. Have you investigated the
Donaldson case, aka the vertical plane
case? Best wishes, Tim.
>> Ah, the vertical plane case. the um it
does sound like a UA UAP craft, but the
uh the Doleston messages were these
weird messages that somebody apparently
had a very early home computer in an old
farmhouse in the United Kingdom and they
left it on at night and apparently
they'd been having all manner of weird
poltergeist like phenomena. They'd found
footprints, six toaded footprints in the
corners of the house in the dusk in the
dust and uh there was all manner of
weird paranormal telekinesis type
phenomena that they couldn't explain.
And apparently
this is the implausible part of this.
Why would a guy from Elizabeth in
England know how to operate a home
computer? That was always the when I
read this book, The Vertical Plane, it
talked about how they found messages on
their home computer in these Donaldston
messages, which were a person writing in
Elizabethan English pros. And apparently
it was like there were linguists who are
familiar with oldie Elizabeth in English
and it was absolutely spot-on accurate
to the way that people spoke at that
time. And whoever it was had typed on
the computer a message uh angrily
claiming them for taking over his home.
And the claim was made or the suspicion
was that it was some kind of
interdimensional portal where he was
somehow able from 15th century England
able to tap on a computer keyboard in
20th century England and leave messages
for the young couple. Now I I guess I'm
thinking about how a caveman would feel
if he saw a computer keyboard or a
mobile phone. Uh, how on earth would
somebody from Elizabeth and England know
how to operate a computer and tap a
message art? Uh, that was always my
problem with the Dolston messages. Um, I
did read the book, The Vertical Play. I
commend it to people because it
certainly baffled a lot of investigators
from British UFO groups that went and
investigated because apparently some of
this phenomena manifested when they were
there and they they saw some of this
happening. So, uh, a lot of people
vouched for the integrity of the couple
that owned the house. And I'd actually
love to know. I don't know whether it's
still happening, but, um, certainly, uh,
it was a very interesting British
paranormal story, wonderful ghost story,
whether it's true or not, where
essentially some dude from Elizabeth in
England starts leaving messages on an
old home computer. And, as far as I
know, it was never disproven, but it was
never proven either.
Okay, we have Carolyn who lives in
London reaching out to us on email. Dear
Ross, firstly, thank you for all the
time and effort you invest in trying to
clarify and expose information which is
legitimately belongs to humanity per se.
I was fascinated by your interview with
Jake Barber. He is both courageous and
selfless. I understand and endorse his
efforts to control the narrative
somewhat because I trust him to be
rigorous and exercise moral
responsibility with the matter of
disclosure. I am equally impressed with
the journey Brandon Fugle has both
enabled and undergone and would thank
him. His unnerving and dodge
determination is inspiring and is
unfortunately what it's going to take.
Thank you for your recent interview with
him. My question is as follows. It has
been evident since the first TV series
filmed at Skinwalker Ranch that the
phenomena is aware of the intention of
investigators. Jake's initiative is
enabled by the use of psionics, the
deliberate use of intentional thought.
In your opinion, would it be productive
for Travis and Jake to cooperate by
creating a joint but discreet
supplementary investigation to help
clarify how the physical manifestation
is related to the forces of intention
and telepathy?
>> Oh, that's a really interesting
question. So, basically, um the idea of
um getting collaboration between Travis
Taylor from Skinwalker Ranch and Jake
Barber who's taken interest in psionics.
Um, I can tell you, I don't think I'm
giving anything away here. Uh, I can
tell you that, um, there is going to be
a video coming out, I hope relatively
soon, from our friends at uh, at
SkyWatcher. Uh that's the uh Jake
Barber, Alex Clous um privately funded
group that are investigating UAP
phenomena and trying to use psionic
summoning and the dog whistle to bring
UAP objects, craft close in so that they
can be videoed, photographed and
studied. Um they are doing a study on
psionics. Uh they've spoken publicly
about this in their previous videos. I
think they've done interviews where
they've talked about the fact that they
are going to be studying telepathy and
psionics and um I'm really excited. I'm
aware of some of the work that they've
been doing and I'm really excited. I'm
told they are in the peer review process
at the moment and it's taking a lot
longer than expected. Um, I am assured
there is no cover up underway that they
are going to be fully open and
transparent and I'm looking forward at
some stage to interviewing uh either
Alex or Jake or somebody from Skywatcher
about it. But um they are tied up in a
very rigorous peer review process that
is part of their own internal vetting
and checking procedures. But at some
stage very very soon work that quite
exciting work that I'm aware of that
they've been doing with telepathy will
be being made public. Um uh watch this
space.
>> All right Ross, this viewer is coming
from Bali, Indonesia. His name is Steve.
Hi Ross and Megan. Thanks for that great
interview with Michael Herrera a while
ago. Would you consider interviewing
ufologist Timothy Alberino who
investigated similar suspicious Black
Ops militia abducting humans with alien
tech down in Peru? Are you familiar with
this case? Keep up the good work.
>> Actually, I have exchanged messages with
Tim Alberino and he is on my list. Uh,
as we all say, too much reality check is
barely enough. And frankly, I just can't
keep up with the volume of people that
are available to be interviewed and the
breadth and magnitude of the stories
that we're trying to cover here. It's
really exciting. Actually, I'm very much
enjoying I I thought where I'm living at
the moment, I'd be moving into a quiet,
gentle, peaceful retirement in the
southern highlands south of Sydney,
maybe doing the odd UFO book and maybe
doing the odd interview. It's just
unbelievable the volume of messages and
responses that we're getting from
people. It's very, very gratifying. And
Tim's one of them. He did some great
work. I've watched a few of his shows
where he actually went down and
investigated claims, particularly claims
about the abduction or the attempted
abduction of I think a 15year-old
teenage girl from a um tribal community
in Brazil, Peru. can't remember which
place it was, but she told this
harrowing story of this being on some
kind of levitating platform coming
towards her up a slope, grabbing her and
trying to abduct her. Quite a
frightening story. And um uh if you take
this into the context of the chuba
chubbers which we've also spoken about
with Ronnie Vern Brazilian friend we
know that there are claims in tribal
communities in both Brazil and Peru
often unfriendly beings often using
highly advanced technology that try and
abduct locals particularly young women.
So yeah, Tim Alberino has investigated
that and thank you for reminding me. I
we should get Tim on. That's a great
idea. I'm also in touch with Ronnie
Verete who's doing another trip very
soon to northern Brazil and we're hoping
to bring you a story on that at some
stage as well.
>> Okay. Hi Russ and Megan. Great show. I
never miss it and keep up the great
work. Question. I know from listening to
your recent podcast with guest Dr. Dr.
Anna Brady Estz, a scientist, a founding
member of a deep tech investment firm,
someone who has held directorial
positions on many boards that promote
learning and investment in science,
tech, energy, digital resources, an
extremely credible and well-informed
individual. The doctor has publicly
spoken and confirmed the US and world
government's awareness of UAP and that
commercial partners are taking the
significance and potential of this
extremely seriously. This once not so
open secret is now not a secret to
well-informed business entities. How and
when is the knowledge of going of this
going to be broadcast to the general
public front page stuff I would have
thought. Will we now see capitalist
greed overcome humanities right now?
Kind regards, Matt. Well, sometimes
capitalist greed does really clever
things and frankly free enterprise is
one of the ways that we've been able to
develop technologies. And I I just want
to applaud Anna Brady Estz for speaking
as frankly as she did to us the other
day with Sarah Gam about what she saw
over the Congress. We had her on to talk
about the weird objects that they saw
hovering over the Congress the night
prior to the UAP hearing before
Congress. They didn't quite land on the
White House lawn, but they certainly
made themselves known. And more
prominently, Anna Brady Estis, who's an
extremely reputable scientist and very
very well-connected in space tech, has
spoken out quite prominently on the
issue of UAPs. She gave a um May
yeah it was May this year May 2025 UAP
experts panel briefing to Congress and
she described how she co-chared an inter
agency working group that included
leaders from the NASA space force the
department of energy department of
health human services and indeed there's
a podcast a NASA sponsored podcast that
she was involved in that we spoke about
in this program and I asked her about it
which was just incredible because she
had a guy called Richard Bandurich who
talked about working with UAP technology
and all credit to Anna she makes no
secret of the fact that she thinks that
there is retrieved technology and that
everybody knows it and everybody's
talking about it and in her briefing to
Congress she noted that this um inter
agency group that she was part of um
facilitated UAP leading content
discussions including indications that
there was high government awareness and
coordination on UAP data and science.
She talked about declassification
efforts and said that previously
classified or unclassified UAP related
work has led to open expert
presentations such as inviting
specialists to share extended
electronamics or dedicated UAP
presentations and perhaps Richard
Bandurik's presentation that he gave to
her podcast was one of them. So this is
suggesting that maybe what's happening
is that maybe government secrets are
slowly being allowed to be revealed
through industry discussions such as
what she's having. And in the same
congressional briefing that she gave in
May this year, she actually addressed
crash retrievalss, UAP crash retrievals
directly. She said, "Are there crash
retrievalss?" Well, are there crashes? I
mean, there's where I live. I mean, a
crash seems a lot more interesting than
a deer to pick up. And anybody who knows
an engineer says the first time you see
anything of interest, you're certainly
going to reverse engineer it. And I
guess this was a very koi way of saying
that government and private entities
inevitably are going to try and reverse
engineer anything that they can
retrieve. They would naturally pursue
recovery and um analysis of UAP crashes.
Um and then she further elaborated. She
said, "Do we just not do certain
layering or advancement of certain
materials because they've been found in
crash retrievals?" And that appeared
again to Coily suggest that there were
UAP derived materials that were
influencing UF US scientific and
engineering advancements. And so I think
Dr. Brady Estus has been quite prominent
in sticking her head up indicating very
very strongly that there is retrieved
technology and um on the uh show the
good trouble show recently my friend
Matt Ford she actually talked about
credible sources and high-erforming
technologies that have emerged from UAP
crash retrievals and she talked about a
former CIA director's secret ties to
UFOs UAPs and extraterrestrials.
And she emphasized how such programs
have accelerated innovations in lasers,
semiconductors, and energy systems. She
was pretty damn clear that she thinks
that UAP tech has influenced what we've
developed. And she also described
widespread sightings of ultra advanced
craft that are higher performing, that
had been captured on various sensors by
innovators in aerospace and energy
fields. And she noted that for people
that are building the highest performing
craft and the highest performing energy,
they're not trying to unsee what they've
seen. So she implied very very strongly
that these observations do challenge
human technological limits and point to
nonhuman origins. And in the
congressional briefing, she revealed
that 30 to 50% of innovators in closed
rooms share personal UAP experiences.
And she framed this as a common
phenomenon among scientists rather than
a fringe belief. She positioned UAPs as
an engineering data analysis problem,
not folklore. and she talked about
funded private companies developing UAP
inspired or UAP adjacent technologies
during her National Science Foundation
tenure. She was actually on the board of
the National Science Foundation. So
she's advocated for US national
preparedness and stigma for re free
research and she told the podcasts that
she's spoken to that transparency is
essential as quote secret UFO UAP
science and technologies are already
changing everything through government
and entrepreneurial channels. Overall,
she basically made it very very clear
that the US government and private
aerospace are up to their necks in UAP
technologies. They're just not telling
us about it. And I think it's incredibly
significant that somebody of the stature
and high reputation of Dr. Anna Brady
Estz is willing to speak publicly about
this and know that she's not going to
suffer stigma, ridicule, or denigration
or threats as a result of her speaking
out. And maybe that's where disclosure
is going to come from because I'm sorry,
I don't think it's going to come anytime
soon from government. Might come from
the CIA. I I noticed and I I keep on
hoping that people like John Brennan. I
I heard a whisper that the Age of
Disclosure documentary is going to be
coming out soon, possibly on a limited
cinema release and um more broadly
possibly on Prime Amazon. But on that,
John Brennan, the former CIA director
from 2013 to 2017 under Obama, he was
very vocal on UAPs. In in um he's in a
2020 interview, he described Pentagon
released UFO videos as quite eyebrow
raising, emphasizing that while he
doesn't know their origins, they warrant
serious investigation beyond
conventional explanations like foreign
adversaries. and he suggested the
phenomena might represent a different
form of life leaving open the
possibility that it's extraterrestrial
and I understand he's gone a lot further
in what he said in age of disclosure and
John Ratcliffe who's the current CIA
director he's worth mentioning actually
I've made a few notes of what John
Ratcliffe have said um he was nominated
as the CIA director in late 2024
confirmed by the Senate this year and in
public appearances John Ratcliffe, the
CIA director, has asserted that UAPs
demonstrate quote technologies that we
don't have and frankly that we can't
defend against. They've been tracked by
multiple sensors, including satellites.
And he's ruled out the explanation that
they might be illusions or drones. He
criticized the Biden administration for
withholding information, claiming,
quote, "The government has more
information than it's sharing." and he
promised more revelations once
declassified.
And during his uh DNI tenure when he was
the director of national intelligence,
Ratcliffe pushed for declassification,
noting that there'd been sightings all
over the world with no clear
explanation. And he's vowed to be more
open. So fingers crossed from Tulsi
Gabbard and DNI and John Ratcliffe in
CIA, we might see a move for greater
disclosure because it's sure as hell not
going to come from Congress by the looks
of it.
>> Okay, Ross, we have time for one more.
Adrian reached out to me on X and he
says, "Ask Ross if I can take him for a
beer next time he's in Melbourne. I
promise I won't ask him anything about
UAPs." Oh, bollocks. Of course you'd ask
me about UAPs. I'd love to talk about
UAPs. Um, you don't have to buy me a
beer, but I'm very happy to have a beer
with you. One of the gratifying things
about doing this story is when I was on
uh 60 Minutes quite often, people would
walk up to me in airports and abuse me
about my latest story. They'd say,
"Yeah, mongrel, you got no idea what
you're talking about. You got it all
wrong." And the lovely thing about doing
this story is the level of positive
public feedback that I get frequently.
I've never I mean it's actually quite
weird. I walk through any airport or
public space, I'm generally stopped by
someone saying how much they love the
show, how much they appreciate it. Uh
when I was in the United States in May,
every single airport that I went
through, I was stopped by people
multiple times and told how much they
appreciated the show. And can I tell
you, it's very gratifying. I love it. I
um I really enjoy the fact that you like
the show. We're very gratified that
we're in the top 50 podcasts for the
United States. You like what we're doing
and we're going to keep on doing it for
you. And uh just echoing what I said at
the uh in last week's show about the
level of unpopularity of mainstream
media. I think 28% of people trust the
media, which is a ridiculously lower
number. I think I think the figure was
8% of Republicans trust the mainstream
media. I like to think that people trust
us on reality check because we do try
and talk warts and all about the UAP
issue and all the other subjects that
are so taboo the mainstream media won't
touch it with a barge pole. So, please
keep on listening to us and thank you
very very much for your gratifying
response and yes mate, next time I'm in
Melbourne, let's have that beer.
>> Okay, Ross, that is all for today. We
are done.
>> Thank you very very much, Megan. And of
course, if you want to send us
questions, you can send me an email at
realitycheck@newsnationow.com.
[Music]
And please don't forget, too much
reality check is barely enough. You can
uh listen again to Reality Check on all
of the known podcast sites, Spotify,
Apple Podcasts, and all the others. You
can just put Reality Check, Ross Kulart
Newsnation into the search engine, and
you will find us there. You can listen
to us while you drive, while you shower,
while you lie in bed because too much
reality check is barely enough. Thank
you so much for joining us and thank
