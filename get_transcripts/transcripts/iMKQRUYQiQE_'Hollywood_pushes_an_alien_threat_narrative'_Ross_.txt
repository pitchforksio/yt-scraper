The threat narrative has been a
consistent theme in Hollywood, aliens as
threat, and it goes right back to the
40s and the 50s when the first Alien
movies started uh started coming. But
there are the odd exceptions, notably
Steven Spielberg, and I'm really looking
forward to Steven Spielberg's imminent
movie. I'm told it's going to be very
interesting. Uh let's not forget also
that um David Grush has been an adviser.
It's been reported on a future Jerry
Brookenheimr film that's going to be
investigating the covert cover up inside
government and private aerospace. So,
there are some great movies coming. But
yes, you're right. There is a Hollywood
threat narrative. And yes, there is an
argument in ufology that the threat
narrative is wrong and that most um
nonhuman intelligence engagements or
encounters by humans have been
benevolent and friendly.
