Why hasn't Matthew Brown's immaculate
constellation report on UAPs been
discussed on reality check? His insights
were highlighted by Rep. Nancy Mason and
deemed credible by others. Is there a
specific reason for this omission?
>> Oh, interesting question. Um, look, to
be honest with you, um, I I've felt that
Matthew's been on so many shows. We try
and bring you programs that break news
and, um, my friends and colleagues
George Knapp and Jeremy Corbell over at
Weaponized, who've done a superb job
bringing Matthew's story, uh, to public
attention. Um, uh, I'd love to have
Matthew on with Reality Check at some
stage. And I've really enjoyed and I
recommend to people that they read his
more expansive Substack essays that he's
been writing in recent times. Um, you
can go to Matthew Brown's Twitter and
you can find your way to his Substack
through there.
