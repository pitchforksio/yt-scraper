If the president of the United States
issued an executive order that
absolves me of all of my TSSCI NDAs,
NDAs are non-disclosure agreements.
Those are the agreements we have to sign
for every compartment in our SCI
clearances.
So if the president waves or absolves my
obligation to those NDAs and I get
subpoenaed by Congress, some somebody on
Capitol Hill, some committee either in
the Senate or the House or the both to
reveal everything I know that I learned
from my investigations both unclassified
and classified into the legacy UAP crash
retrieval and hardware reverse
engineering and NA NHI programs. I would
do so if I could be waved from that or
absolved in some fashion by presidential
order. And if Congress subpoenas me,
yes, I would go and tell him everything
I know.
>> Dr. Eric Davis makes it very clear
there, James, that he knows stuff. He,
as you know, investigated the claims
that there was this legacy UAP, NHI,
non-human intelligence craft retrieval
program, and he became aware, he's
testified before, that there has been
this ongoing reverse engineering
program.
What he's saying though is very
significant because he's essentially
saying if the president if Donald Trump
was merely to say you know overnight I
can wave those secrecy orders I can wave
those NDAs he Dr. to Eric Davis and
presumably many other witnesses could
come forward.
