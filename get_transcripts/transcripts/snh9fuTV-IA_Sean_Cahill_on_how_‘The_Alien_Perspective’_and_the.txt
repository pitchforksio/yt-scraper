Good day and welcome back to Reality
Check. I'm your host, Ross Coulter, and
today I've got a very interesting story
about a new two-part documentary, The
Alien Perspective, made by filmmaker
Dean Aliatoto. and he's joined today by
an old friend of mine, Sha Cahill, who's
the former master at arms on the USS
Princeton, one of the witnesses to the
extraordinary 2004 USS Nimtt's battle
fleet incident of UFOs, reigning UFOs,
as my friend Kevin Day has described.
Welcome to Reality Check, gentlemen.
Lovely to have you here. Great to be
here. Happy to see you. So Dean, let's
tell me first what's the idea behind The
Alien Perspective? What are you trying
to achieve with this film? I understand
it's on Apple TV in two parts. Tell me
all about it. And Amazon. Um so the idea
came about because um I had made this
film many years ago, 37 years ago, right
out of film school, uh called the
McFerson tape, which was a the first
found footage film. And it was about a
family being abducted because I'd read
the book Communion. Scared the crap out
of me more than any Stephen King novel.
And so I made Can I Can I stop you there
because I'm so pleased you started with
the McFersonen tape because I know your
work on the McFersonen tape and I
rewatched it last night and it's still
scary. Um, but but but what really blew
me away about that film was you managed
to I mean it was kind of for me whilst I
enjoyed the fact that it was such a you
know an an incredibly persuasive film
that it was authentic footage. It was
kind of like Blair Witch Project. What
really kind of upset me a little bit was
that that people were fooled. Like Tom
Dongo, one of the old eminent screes of
UFO researchers was fooled and uh I I
think I've forgotten his name. There was
a lieutenant Don Wear. Yeah. I I felt
very sad that they were essentially
tricked. Tell me though the context.
What was the what was the fallout from
the McFersonen film? Sure. So, I made
this film and uh because it was 10 years
before the Blair Witch, it was looked
upon as being this weird kind of
avantguard piece of crap to be honest
because you got people talking over each
other. You have uh long takes um very
much the the tropes now today in film
footage. Well, I made this thing and
then um it got distributed miraculously,
but then a month later the distribution
company uh I called them to say, "Hey,
how is the movie doing? How's it
selling?" And he goes, "Oh, it's up in
flames." And I went, "Yes, that's great.
How many units do we sell VHS?" And he
says, "Uh, no, mate. It's gone." As in
up in flames. Our warehouse burned to
the ground. So your master gone, your
artwork gone. And so I thought, well,
that's the film god saying, "Nice try,
kid. Move on." And so I did. And then
five years later, I get a call from some
guy that just came from the
International UFO Congress convention
where the film screen without any
credits. And so we reverse engineered
this and discovered that someone had
edited off the credits and injected it
to the UFO community because a few mom
and pop video stores, which they used to
have back then, got um an advanced
screener. And so it ended up at at this
international UFO Congress convention
and it brought the house down. So this
guy called to say Unsolved Mysteries
Hard Copy and a Fox show called
Encounters wanted to do a segment on
this. And I said, "Well, I guess
Unsolved Mysteries is out." And this guy
who who yeah, he's I'm not that's a
whole other story. He said, "Well, not
necessarily." And I said, "Yeah, it's
called Unsolved, not Solved Mysteries,
so we'll go on this Fox show." And we
did this thing. And so I think I'm the I
guess I'm the first filmmaker to ever
debunk my own film because of that very
reason, Ross, which is I didn't want to
have this on the plate of serious UFO
researchers. So I did everything I
could. I posted pictures when the
internet hit of behind the scenes,
everything, and just said, "Look, this
is an example of what might happen if
this goes down, but this is not the real
thing." And I brought actors out from
the film, everything.
It's funny, you know, because I I was
really thinking about how to come
through into this interview today
because I was actually going to raise
the McFersonen film because I was really
confronted by it. I rewatched it last
night and I watched the episode you're
talking about on um the TV show and it's
interesting because at the heart of the
issue for euphology at the moment there
is a dilemma. There's too much emphasis,
I think, being placed on f frankly
 vision, crap crap video that
that people send me. I get hundreds of
videos a day. People haven't done any
checks, any prosaic checks to see
whether or not the the video might be
explainable away prosaically. And it's a
big issue because with AI these days,
it's just so easy to fake to to forge
genuine looking, authentic looking UFO
vision. What do we do about that? Isn't
that a big dilemma for the whole subject
matter? Well, I go online and I kind of
um am that debunker um in the sense if
it's bunk, I'm going to underscore it
and do that because I have a little bit
of savviness doing special effects on
films where I can see where like the
frame rate is off or whatever, but it's
it's proliferated to the point where
it's just this this onslaught
bombardment. And so my my feeling is
that I thought which was the reason why
I actually made this this the first
documentary the perspective part one was
I got invited for the 25th anniversary
to go back to the international UFO
Congress convention and to present you
know they have like these 75minute TED
talks essentially and I said at first I
go I'm not interested in that because I
don't know how I'm going to be received
because I take my work very serious but
I don't take myself serious. and I feel
like kind of the Forest Gump in all
this. And he said, "No, no, no. They're
great. Tons of levity. Don't worry about
it." And I came and fell in love with
the community. That was 2018. So, I've
always been kind of an armchair proumer
and then I became an armchair expert
when because I've done documentaries for
A&E, Bravo, etc. I thought, boy, there's
a real opportunity here to tap into the
UFO community and and and serious
experiencers as well as accredited
people from Oxford and get Mitchio Kau
because I've done science docs, I can
pull these people in and have them talk
even as a hypothetical about this. And
so, the one thing that I knew that I had
to do because we've seen so many UFO
docs, Ross, you've seen tons, is to
present it in a way that hasn't been
done before. And what I do as a
filmmaker is I look and see what
everyone's doing. Then I do the
opposite. In this case, all the UFO docs
out of necessity are all told from the a
from the human's perspective. I
consulted on James Fox as the phenomenon
and and believe in that. However, I
thought, what if you did this as a
hypothetical? What could be gleaned from
this looking at it from the aliens
perspective? So, that was the thesis and
that set me off on a seven-year journey.
um 66 interviews and four countries
later um it's you know time to get it
out there and um it's it's pretty wild
because I'm serving two two masters. One
is the UFO community who know everything
and then the other is to get people who
are kind of by UFO curious and come on
board and say we're going to start at
NASA we'll go easy but then we're going
to go hardcore and that spans over two
films. The first one is out the second
one drops June 1st. Now, one of the
incidents of course that you talk about
is the the USS Nimmits battlefleet
incident that took place in 2004, which
is of course is one of the definitive
UFO UAP incidents where for the first
time you had multiple sensor systems,
multiple gradea human eyeballs on these
objects giving definitive witness
statements, credible statements, and
more importantly, you had phased array
radar systems. And one of those eyeballs
was you, Sean. Uh I think you were
standing on the bridge of the USS
Princeton as Kevin Day was was calling
in what they were seeing on the uh on
the screens. Can you talk me through
that? That's correct. Uh over the course
of a week back in 2004, I was stationed
on board the USS Princeton as the chief
master at arms. Uh Kevin was calling me
up on the bridge and we were
coordinating ship movements to aid him
in in focusing the radar, pointing it in
certain directions and keeping the uh
the watch officers eyes on the skies for
for anomalies as he was detecting them
on the radar. Uh it was an incredible
week. Um and it it frankly in my opinion
it's it's the case that Arrow and others
should be focusing on absolutely uh
laser focused on. We have the most
information on it and we've probably
heard the least about it from authority.
So, what did you see?
Well, over the course of that week, we I
didn't see any radar contacts. I was
responding to to Kevin's calls on the on
the telephone, but at one point he had
called up and very vehemently uh
reiterated that he needed me to make
sure all of my watch standards were
scanning the skies for anomalous
contacts. And so I'd went out and I'd
walked around the deck and spoke
personally to each of them and then went
back up onto the portside bridge wing of
the ship where I began scanning with my
own binoculars. I was there with another
sailor who was utilizing what we call
the big eyes which are really just a
very very large pair of stationary
binoculars on the bridge. Both of us
were scanning off the port side and as I
scanned from the port uh beam up to the
to the folks I saw five to seven lights
up in the sky up in this this
constellation and they started
immediately one by one moving centrally
towards the center and then blinking
out. Um and I'd never seen anything like
that at all. I'd spent years training
people in use of flares, different
weapon systems. I'd been exposed to all
the different weapon systems we have,
whether they're uh defensive or
offensive, and I knew what I was looking
at in the battle space. And I had never
seen anything that closely packed
maneuvering like that before. They were
just white lights, but five to se five
or seven of them. And as I say, I'm not
exactly sure how many because they were
moving, but each of them singularly, one
at a time, circled into the center of
this formation and then disappeared. I'd
never seen anything like that. The
following day in the morning when I woke
up from uh from after the watch, uh we
had the videos sent over from the USS
Nimmits and it was the most incredible
thing I'd ever seen. All of us were were
familiar with what fleer pods and what
infrared and and night vision looks like
and all of the nomenclature on the
screen and we knew that we were looking
at something that was not in our
arsenal. Um it had no wings. It had no
propulsion systems. It was not giving
off a proper heat signature like a
normal aircraft and it maneuvered in a
way on the on the video like we'd never
seen before. And as we all know now, the
corroborating uh evidence from the
pilots and what they saw says that what
we were dealing with that day were not
human derived aircraft. So, put me into
Dean's brain on that subject. What's the
alien perspective on the Nimmits
incident that we haven't got to date?
me or Sean? Um, Sean or you? I'm really
open to I'm I'm really open to both of
you. Um, why don't you take this, Sean?
When I I met Dean back in, I believe,
2018, he was one of the first people
that I met in the UFO community. I was
introduced to him by Luis Alzando at
Comic-Con here in San Diego. Uh, we'd
met up and did a little thing for um I
believe Denovgeeek to promote um some
some other stuff. I believe the the show
unidentified that that I was appearing
on with Luis. And in that in that
evening, Dean had shown me that he I was
so lucky that I had found someone that I
that was of the same moral set, had the
same ethics that I did, cared about
people the same way that I did, and
wanted to tell a true story about what
we had experienced that night. Um, and
on the in those surrounding days. And
for me, what Dean brought to the table
was a a a humanity, a piece of the
connection that was missing from all of
this, what was happening at the ground
level for the people that are noticing
and interacting with this phenomena when
it occurs. And he told me that we were
going to tell a different story, that we
were going to talk about what we derived
from that interaction. what could we
what could we say about whatever this
phenomena is whether it's alien or or
some other um strange thing that we
don't understand and from what I've seen
from the work that he's done he really
started to capture that in and I want to
see more from him and I want to see more
people talking about what happened at
the ground level and then cooperating
that information with the data we have
gives us a much better picture of what
people have experienced and what we may
be dealing with that it doesn't seem
like frankly the government is going to
share that information with us right
now.
Can can I can I just get into your brain
a little bit though because you and I
have spoken before about how profound an
experience this was for you and I think
one of the things that interests me is
this was quite a spiritual thing for you
wasn't it this encounter it was a real
wakeup can put put tell me if if we're
looking at a film from the alien
perspective if you like what do you
think was the intention of whatever the
the beings or the intelligent sentient
creatures that might have been behind
those objects. What was their intention
that day in 2004?
It's a very good question.
Um, some people might ask why out of 400
crew members or myself and and Kevin Day
people that speak up about this. Not
only there were other people that were
involved. Um, in the past I was more
reticent to discuss this, but C. Kevin
and I are both two men who have been
experiencing this phenomena for as long
as we can remember. It goes all the way
back to our childhoods. It intersects
with numerous points in our lives and
other people in our lives. And we've
sought answers for
this. Um, I don't have a good answer for
it because I still think we're missing
data on that event. But there seems to
be something occurring that certain
individuals, certain people are noticing
things in the environment, whether
they're whether they are their brains
are operating on a different frequency.
Um whether their state of mind has
something to do with it, there's a great
deal of data involved in that.
Um it I have to say though if I if I'm
going to be courageous in my answer that
after all these years I do think there
is something to the phenomenon that is
trying to wake humanity up and trying to
wake them up to an aspect of our
existence that we're not paying
attention to and something that is just
incredibly important to our continued
existence to pay attention to and to
interface with. And I know it's
confusing, especially when you have the
military and the intelligence complex
running point on this subject, but there
does seem to be something involving
consciousness and awareness that we need
to to focus on, I believe. So Dean,
let's talk about that because to me,
it's I've always been struck with Sean.
I've I've always admired your honesty
and your cander, Sean, in speaking so
openly about how profound that
experience was for you. And I've always
been intrigued by the fact that there
were earlier experiences in your life
that that may in fact be connected to
the broader experience that you had with
the phenomenon. What's your take on
that, Dean? What do you think of the
idea that essentially what the
phenomenon is trying to do is twig make
us make us aware of it in do something
in our consciousness? Yeah, you know
full well, Ross. I mean, uh, your book,
Hide in Plain Sight, you know, this is a
deep rabbit hole and when it grabs you,
it pulls you in. I was expecting to do a
film, a documentary that would be nine
months of my time, 15 interviews, done.
And then I go to NASA and I'm like, what
is the protocol for when you guys
actually find a civilization where you
can see a light grid and cities and
everything? And she got the giggles and
I have this on camera. She has no idea
what they do. There's no protocol at
NASA for that. So then I have to go and
find out. And as soon as you do that,
it's this viral thing that keeps going
and going. And so when I went to
interview Sean, I I knew in my brain
that I was going to be taking the Tic
Tac incident and taking it outside of
this footage that could be almost
mistaken some of it for the game of
Pong. you know, if you're as old as I
am, you remember that little um disc
going back and forth. And because I'm a
little bit dyslexic and I'm a filmmaker
because of that, probably because I'm a
visual person, I wanted to present that
where people could actually see it. And
so that's when I went after this um uh
this animator who's done films for
Academy Award-winning films, Arvidstein,
to actually reenact that. And so you get
to see inside the the cocktail or
cocktail cockpit of Commander Fraver.
you get to see it from the Tic Tacs
perspective. But getting back to your
main question, when I went, can I just
say congratulations on that by the way?
It's a fantastic looking film. Um,
beautifully shot, lush, gorgeous
production. But I think some of the most
exciting stuff for me was the animation.
just to talk to what you do. It's when
Dave Fraver, for example, is talking
about how he he decided to he was in
that tracking corkcrew with the tic tac
as it was coming up to him and he was
corkcrewing down and then he decided to
turn on his wing and zoom across the
clock face as they call it towards this
object. And you show beautifully how
literally the tic tacs right in front of
his cockpit and then it just goes
disappear. Well, I didn't want to do 3D.
I wanted to do 2D. It's all handdrawn.
It's it's like really exceptional work.
But, but when I put that together, um,
it all starts with the interviews,
right? And so, when I interviewed Sean,
I thought I'm going to get kind of the
logistics of this, but because I've
worked on crime shows for 20 years, I
tend to go a little bit deeper because I
want to talk about how it affected them.
What is the takeaway? Not just that
moment, but the residual effect like you
had asked Sean about that. How does that
affect you? And that blew my socks off.
I mean, first of all, Sean is an
extremely articulate person, has a great
vocabulary when it comes to describing
anything uh and and can concisely
condense what it is that he felt. And so
when I was talking to him, it it became
this thing where both of us got a little
emotional as we were walking through
this. um this affected him on so many
levels and it wasn't just bam here you
go here's the brain dump it was this
timereleas thing and so when I hear
people say you know oh experience or
this or that I'm going you do know that
experiencers aren't just people who are
taken abductees there are people who are
connecting that is an experience and so
the levels that Sean is comfortable with
with with sharing which he did in the
film and and now you know personally
is is a real testament to someone that
is experiencing something that is a
communion as as Whitley would say with
higher intelligence. And why is that
happening? Can I ask you this? How many
because you did a phenomenal job going
around the world talking to some of the
more interesting people on the UAP
issue, particularly a lot of UAP
experiences.
How many of the UAP experiences that
you've interviewed have had the same
experiences, Sean, where yes, they've
had this one incident, be it the Ariel
incident or the Rendlessham incident,
but it always turns out in a large
percentage of these cases when they look
back in their family history, there's
there's something there. It might be a
granny who saw spirits or it might be a
grandfather who saw a UFO when he was in
the World War II. How often did you have
that experience when you were doing the
research? Well, I have to caveat this.
Um, but
first, most of them. Um, there was some
traces of this in in their past. Um, I
say caveat because I'm not an
experiencer that I'm aware of. My mother
saw a UFO in the Bay Area off off the
water. She saw it looked like it came
out of the water. She thought it was a
boat or submarine or something. It was
dusk. came up and then paused and then
took off like it smeared the sky. I've
been wanting to see this since I was a
kid and and so Ivonne Smith who has been
gracious enough to let me go to um a
abductee or experiencer support groups
and I've gone to a few in fact I'm one
of the only filmmakers who's been
allowed to film there and that's a whole
other documentary that I'll hopefully
come back on your show and tell you
about. She said, I said to her, I go,
"Why am I doing this?" Because I've been
at this for seven years now, and it's
got such a pull on me. And sometimes
when I'm editing, I feel this like rush,
this energy almost like, you know, the
hair back of my neck stands up. And I
said, "But I've come through my past. I
have no memory, missing time, etc." And
she laughed at me and said, "Dean, they
don't have to knock on your door to
connect with you." Which was both kind
of scary and revealing. And so when I
talk to these experiencers, um, I want
to know that I want to know what
happened in your childhood. Did you
always were you always interested in
this? And it doesn't really kind of it's
kind of like this memory that gets joged
when they have it as an adult. It's
like, hey, remember us? And and I'm
curious to hear Sean talk about that
some more. But you inevitably there is
something that happened. And I don't
know if it's because again they're
chosen or they're open to it. I think
that might be it. But Sean, can I ask
you did I I don't want to put you on the
spot because you don't have to talk
about it if you don't want to, but what
were the kind of early experiences and
senses that you had as a child before
the whole USS Princeton incident?
There were some that were very uh as a
very young child. Um we had an incident
around Christmas uh where my sister had
come into my room and I was there was
something on the roof. I was convinced
uh it was Santa Claus. And she told me
it was Santa Claus, but she was very she
was incredibly frightened. She was
absolutely terrified. And we ended up
spending the whole night in my room. I
must have been five or six years old. Um
and we ended up against the door to my
room on the floor with me kind of in a
in a headlock hug that she had put me
in. And as embarrassing as it is, I
remember wetting my pants trying to get
away from her um because I wanted to see
Santa Claus and she was crying.
Um there were events surrounding that
that Christmas that were so strange that
um I I have to attribute it to the
phenomenon. in in years uh later years
uh in high school, I was involved in
something with a couple of friends where
we had all seen a very um a beautiful
meteor, just a giant green football
moving slowly across the sky and
spitting out these sparks out of the
back that looked like it was from a a an
old 1920s um Buck Rogers film. It
looked, frankly, it looked ridiculous.
And my memory of that was that we went
back to my house and wrote songs for the
band that night and talked about seeing
that and kind of all separated and wrote
it down and and that was it and moved
on. And years after meeting Luis uh
Alzando and and kind of sitting down and
going back through my memories, I called
those two friends up and they said they
had a completely different memory of the
evening where we had driven up to Mount
Hamilton Observatory chasing after this
thing. um and that I had exited the car
and interacted with blue orbs in the
parking lot of the Hamilton Observatory
while they hid in the car. And I have no
memory of that. Um and that that
probably if anything bothers me more,
but even in the years after Tic Tac, um
I witnessed a a incredibly large black
triangle come over my house, which was
definitely not a prisa bomber that we
I've guarded the B2. I've been
underneath it. I've I've been around
them constantly. It was certainly not a
B2 or even any of its successors that
might still be classified.
And more so than that, I have to say
that after meeting of the persons that
were involved in these programs that
ended up evolving into the UAPF and
evolving into Arrow and many of the
whistleblowers that are that are
currently out, um the hitchhiker effect
that that is described is a very real
thing.
And for a year or two after first
getting involved in this community and
and in this research and spending so
much time thinking about this subject
um phenomena began to manifest in and
around my home where my family was
witnessing it as well. And that was
really hard for them because they're not
focused on this subject interested. It's
a peripheral thing in their life like it
is for most people. And so it was very
strange for my family to see these
things happening and not
understand. So it's funny. I was funny.
I I was just thinking as you were
talking to me then about how Lou and Jen
Alzando have had similar experiences in
their home. And um I when I did an
interview with Lou last year for his
book um you know he's still a little bit
shy about talking about some of those
experiences and I can understand why
because they just sound completely
offthe-wall. you know, some of them he's
given me permission to say that we've
had experiences together while at his
home uh that my family was also present
for and witnessed and and videotaped
things that others uh believe they've
debunked, but at this point we still we
still certainly have not and we're all
rather educated on the subject. I mean,
I was a crash accident investigator as
part of my duties in the Navy for
aircraft, and I I know what aircraft
look like, especially on high definition
video that I've taken myself that I was
present for. So,
um it's very strange. There there's a
familial aspect for me as well. My
father was a a World War II Foo Fighters
witness while the waste gunner and radio
operator on a B7. Ah, this does my head.
I'm amazed. I'm amazed how often this
runs in a family. Uh I mean I I had a
conversation with a um I'll have to be
discreet here, a federal minister of the
Australian government about 6 months ago
and it still sticks in my head because
he told me this incredible story about
how he was walking out of a government
office in the middle of central Sydney.
So very crowded street. There's
thousands of people at lunchtime and
he's waiting for the crown car to come
and pick him up. Very important guy. Uh,
and he's there with his press secretary
standing there with a bundle of papers.
And as he looks up, he sees this giant
metallic egg hovering in the square. And
he's looks at his press secretary. And
his press secretary is clearly oblivious
to it. And this minister is a very
important figure in one of our
governments, our previous governments.
And he said to me, Ross, I will deny
this if you name me, but basically, I
want you to know it's real. I I I and
more importantly I I just knew I had to
ask him just as a matter of interest,
did your dad or your mom or your
grandfather, your grandma, did they have
experiences? And he looked, how do you
know? And it runs in families this. It's
really weird. And I feel it's a
disservice to the reporting on this
subject matter that we often don't
discuss this aspect of the phenomenon
that it seems to be familial. it seems
to run in family lines. What What's your
take on that? It's It's also weird that
Sean and I turns out grew up in the same
in the same town pretty much. Um we
discovered that later. Um when I I
forgot how it came up, but but yeah, we
were hitting the same haunts. Your
cousin Your cousin gave me a gold watch
when we were in second grade. I hope it
wasn't stolen. It was it was it
was it was I may have an Aliotto family
heirloom in my dresser. So Dean, let's
talk about that. I I was really thrilled
to see you spoke to Salma who's one of
the Ariel uh what do you call them?
Witnesses at the Ariel incident in Rua
Zimbabwe in gosh is it 1994.
U and I I'm really struck for how
profound those beautiful little children
were found, you know, they found that
experience of engaging with what appear
to have been nonhuman intelligences on
their account. Is there the similar kind
of stuff in the background with with
Selma? I I know that from um the um
Randy Nickerson documentary, the school
principal turned out to be having
similar experiences to what we've just
discussed, but is there something that
you found with those children, with
those witnesses that you've spoken to,
similar to what we're talking about?
Yeah, it's interesting because um again
when I started out one dock one and done
well it bloomed up to four episodes and
then those got so big that everything
got bifurcated. So there's the alien
perspective part one, then there's part
two, then there's two other
documentaries. Um, one is going to be
all about John Mack, and then the other
one is called The Experiencers. And, uh,
Salma um is in I believe she might be in
that, but she's definitely the John Mack
stuff. And what's interesting is that
when I interviewed her and was asking
her about that very
thing, she she wasn't sure like there
was she hadn't Here's the thing, Sean
will tell you this. You have to be
willing to go in that journey and go
inward. Some things get lodged by having
that experience as an adult. Other
things don't, but you really have to sit
with yourself and think about it and
comb through and you will find things.
But I don't think that that was, you
know, accidental. I mean, for me, I knew
something else went on during that
event, by the way. And and the John Mack
doc, you're going to see what that was.
There was something else that happened.
And so, I don't want to kind of give it
away, but but it wasn't just this thing.
There was something else going on. And
um and so I I think that this is all
part of something that is happening, an
awakening that's that's happening. And
the question is why now? And I go, well,
with technology, because the two
messages that they say is your
technology isn't helping you. And for
the longest time, we thought, oh, it's
nuclear weapons. I don't know that it's
not smartphones that it's not the
technology we have now. And the other
thing is, you know, you're ruining your
your planet. And they showed them images
and everything. And so I kind of, you
know, wonder because if you went back a
hundred years and you say technology is
not helping or 200 years, you go, oh,
the printing press, that's bad. Now it's
relevant. And so that's maybe why, you
know, this has been reported more so in
the in the 1900s and 2000s. Do you know
it's funny, Sean, I I'm really struck by
a Doctor Who episode I once watched. I
sat there with my daughters and we
watched it and I've forgotten their
names, but there are these creatures
that you can only see out of the corner
of your eye and they're there, but
they're just out of the realm of
immediate direct consciousness. And I
just have this gut feeling because I've
spoken to Lou like you have about some
of the really weird phenomena that he's
had. And I I know and I I empathize with
you that a lot of what you've
experienced is quite personal and you
probably don't want to talk in a lot of
detail about it. And Dean, I'm sure
there are lots of witnesses that you've
interviewed for this film who've
described this phenomena. This this
there's the one main experience that we
all focus on. But I just have this worry
that what's really most important is
what's going on just out of the corner
of our eye. that there is a motive by
whatever this intelligence is that goes
a lot further than just one individual
incident be it the USS Nimttz incident
in 2004 the Ruer Zimbabwe aerial
sightings in
1994 what's going on I mean I know you
don't have the answer but speculate for
me Sean
you know my response to this at first
after Tic Tac to be completely honest
was to run in the other direction from
spirituality. Um the response of my
chain of command and the response of of
those in in leadership on board the ship
at that time in my career had told me
that what we were dealing with was
understood. No, there was nothing to be
afraid of. Get back to work. The big
guys know what's going on. And now I
understand that that's not true. That
was just denial. That was just business
as usual and and those folks moving on
with their own lives. They had no
interest in in latching on to this
whatsoever. But my response was actually
to become rather self-destructive in my
life. I went down I had a period of
alcoholism uh a period of very selfish
behavior. And it part of it was because
for me the universe had just become nuts
and bolts. It had just become math and I
wasn't going to get to know the
mysteries. They probably weren't real
anyway.
And then that became so such a burden
that that self- abuse became such a
burden that I finally broke and changed
my lifestyle. I began meditating. Uh I
began practicing yoga um but practicing
deep meditation while in the yoga not
just the
um Americanized uh group stretching
which is great for for your health but
it's not the same as what's as the
reasoning behind the the asas and the
different positions.
But what I found was something inside of
me that transcended everything else
around me. I found an observer that was
not concerned with the abuses I had been
through in my life, that didn't need to
win the race and didn't need to eat the
the the cookie. Um, and that showed me
that there was something that at the
heart of this, it's one thing to tell us
all that our nuclear weapons are
destructive. I think we know that that
our environmental practices are
destructive. We know that and that our
wars are destructive. We know that and
yet we do them anyway. And we engage in
this behavior every day because we have
a 50/50 set of people. Some of us
selfish and some of us less so. And that
what that does is create an environment
where being your true and honest self is
no longer something that is is conducive
to your survival. you must participate
in this society of of greed and want and
need to have a a proper life with the
with your loved ones. And if there's
anything I think they're waking us up
to, it's that at the core of our
actions, it's not about the bomb. It's
not about the war. It's not about the
pollution. It's about what's in our
heart when we're committing those acts
in our own home and against each other.
And I don't think we understand that
yet. And if we're lucky, they're here to
tell us about that. And if we're not,
they're here to pull one over on us and
act the same way that we're acting to
each other.
I might as well ask you this, Sean. Do
you buy into because there's two debates
in Eupthology. One is the threat
narrative, and the other is they're all
loveydvey. And I don't I don't ascribe
to either of them. I I think there's
probably some malevolent, some
benevolent if there is life forms, and
I'm sure there are.
Um, isn't it a silly debate that polar
debate whether or not there's a threat
narrative behind the whole alien issue
or whether they're benevolent? I know
Dr. Steven Greer, for example, gets very
frustrated with the idea that that we
sometimes talk about a threat that Lou,
particularly Lou Alzando, talks about
the the possibility of a a threat being
posed, but in and of itself, you're a
military man by training. Isn't
something we don't
understand a threat?
Absolutely. Um, as a law enforcement
officer, we talked about opportunity,
intent, and capability. Um, when we were
discussing suspects and the use of force
and deadly force, um, the phenomena has
the opportunity and the capability to do
nearly anything it wants. Um, it seems
to defy physics. it seems to at times
control the people or at least um
manipulate their consciousness when
they're interacting with them. All of
these things are um they're illegal if
they were happening occurring within our
society. So they're things that we cast
moral aspersion on. The fact is the
phenomena does not make it easy for it
to uh interact with. Um, regardless of
what Stephven Greer says, sitting down
and meditating is like opening up
without understanding your intention,
what you're aiming for, or what you're
talking to. You have no idea. It's like
picking up your telephone and just
wondering if someone's going to be on
the other side. You You don't have a
number you're dialing. You don't know.
And it's clear that this phenomenon
understands our own consciousness better
than we do. So, while I won't say that
the phenomenon itself is negative, many
of my experiences were borderline
terrifying, um, if they are so advanced
and so intelligent, I would appreciate
an email or a phone call. And I don't
mean to be flippant. You could I could
you could send me an email and say,
"Hey, come meet the phenomena in this
field at this time and and we'll shake
hands and get to and you don't have to
be scared." But they don't do that. And
so it's it's we're at a spot with the
phenomenon where many are coming out and
talking about psionics. They're talking
about meditating. Um they you know the
term coined by Steven Greer C5 which I I
don't include in J. Allen Highneck CE 1
through4. I I think it's that's for Mr.
Greer alone because it's not fair to say
that you're calling in spaceships. I
don't believe that what people are
interacting with when they go into a
beautiful place inside and meditate and
phenomena manifest. I don't believe
that's the same thing that may have been
retrieved in 1947 by the US government.
And I don't think it's the same thing
that we send out paramilitary teams that
rumor says are are now conflicting with
each other to retrieve these these
materials. Um, I don't think anything I
would pray through my heart to needs a
vehicle to arrive here. And I'm not a
religious man, but I think that we're
we're really muddying the water by
suddenly saying that you can sit down
and meditate and control a spacecraft.
I agree. It's in fact, thank you for
those very profound comments. Dean,
you've had the opportunity to travel the
world and talk to some of the most
interesting brains as commentators, but
also experiences on this issue. You call
your film the alien perspective. as
Sha's describing there, there seems to
be some method behind the madness.
Because, you know, I I like Sha often
think, why the hell don't these
intelligences, if they exist, why don't
they just manifest themselves? Why don't
they just show themselves and be far
more overt and put the mystery to rest
in in the heart of it? Isn't that the
fundamental mystery behind whatever this
intelligence is? And have you got an
answer for me? Why? Why don't these Why
don't these intelligences, as Sha
describes, they operate in such a weird
way? They're just there out of the
corner of our eye trying to twig our
consciousness. They've always been
there. And I'm profoundly struck by how
many people I've spoken to who who are
experiences. When you needle them a bit,
sometimes they don't even realize it.
and they call me back a few days later
and they go, "You know what? I did have
a granny who said she saw strange things
in the kitchen once." You know, people
often realize after the fact that it's
always Why is that? What's going on? All
right, so this answer is going to blow
everyone's mind and they're going to
just get so many numbers it's just going
to go nuts. You ready for this?
The first thing I learned uh in the
first year of the seven years of this
documentary was all the stuff that I
didn't know that I thought I knew. Um I
think where I'm I've arrived at and I'm
I'm agnostic. I'm spiritual but I try to
be open to everything because first law
is no one knows anything. Um is that
uh this is being controlled by them. I
don't worry that much. doesn't keep me
up at night worrying about
uh us being taken over because it would
be very simple for them to send the size
of like fruitfly drones and drop some
chemical that would melt humans, leave
the animals if they want. You could
assign it to certain DNA um of a
creature and then just move in. That's
not the case. What they seem to be doing
is observing us like we would observe
tag if you will, you know, bears in the
wild and everything. We are animals and
we forget that. Proof of animals is that
we fight and we're very emotional. We
haven't gotten to a place transcendental
and otherwise where we realize, oh, if I
hurt this person, I'm hurting myself.
So, I think they're keeping everything
at bay. But I kind of I do this thing
where I walk people through what is the
wish fulfillment? Well, the wish
fulfillment is that like you just said,
Ross, they show up. They show up on the
White House lawn. Let's walk through
that. They show up. They don't get shot
down. Miraculously, they land. The alien
gets out. Then a spokesperson has to go
up to them. Now, if we go with with the
UFO uh beliefs and stories that are
corroborated across the board, across
countries, it's all telepathic. So, now
you've got to rely on the person who is
the spokesperson to accurately convey
what he's doing. So that doesn't really
work. How does how far does the
telepathy reach? Does he have to do a
whistle top whistle stop tour like Teddy
Roosevelt and go from town to town? And
then what are they going to really be
teaching us that that we need to learn?
I mean, we keep saying, "Well, we'd love
to have technology, but we pervert all
technology, right? So we're not at that
level." We go, "Well, we'd like to have
them clean up the pollution here." and I
keep going. So, you want your parent, a
parent, to come in, clean it up, and
say, "Now, keep it the way it is." We
won't. So, I think we need to listen to
what they're saying, and we need to work
on ourselves and know that we are going
to get there. And the proof that we're
going to get there, where we do have
that communion is that they they're not
giving up. They keep coming and coming
and they're shaping certain things and
technology and getting us to a certain
place, but we have to do half the work.
I always say we've got to meet them
halfway on the bridge. One other little
thing is I think that these
experiencers and this is a belief I have
and I hope no one's offended by it but I
do believe a lot of them and John Mack
talks about this that they agreed to do
this in another life and there's some
belief there's a a a term belief that
they have maybe come from their plan or
their future if they're from the future
or another dimension and this is all a
reason and I know this because when I
went to a my first experience a support
group. I said, "Guys, what you're
telling me is terrifying. I couldn't
deal with it. I couldn't deal with
seeing a monkey come around the deck in
broad daylight on my deck. It would
freak the crap out of me because it's
out of context, let alone an alien." So,
you guys are so terrified by this. Show
me, you know, raise up your hands. How
many people would, if they could go
back, have this not happen after you've
told me all this? And there's 15 people
in this room from lawyers, doctors, etc.
And I said, "Raise your hand if you
would still do this again." Every single
one of them raised their hands.
Yeah. I think that's really interesting
because I Everybody I've spoken to
thinks that the experience, albeit, as
Sean says, at times terrifying, it's the
most profound thing they've ever had
happen in their life. And I'm I'm
amazed. I mean, as a journalist who's
done a lot of confronting stories about
crime and corruption, I I don't think
I've ever had so many intense emotional
conversations with people as I have had
doing the research that I've done for
this investigation. Sean Richard Dolan
is one of the I think preeminent
commentators in this field and he he
gave a great speech the other day where
he talked about how people should really
be careful what they wish for when they
just wish you know frankly let's just
find out the secret and have done with
it. And he he actually talked about the
possibility that whatever this
phenomenon is, it might be so far
advanced that it's completely beyond our
ken that that essentially it's
completely indifferent to us like we are
to ants. And I'm really struck by the
fact that earlier in the conversation we
had, you talked about the the
commanders, the the people above you on
that bridge, probably the the admiral or
the captain of the vessel who seemed to
be aware of what this phenomenon was.
And it's interesting because that's the
narrative that frankly pisses me off
that that that there is one part of
society which is government uh people in
the know some sections of the military
and the intelligence community and I'm
often struck by how often when I talk to
some of these people privately including
people inside the program inside the
retrieval and reverse engineering
program and they tell me that the
phenomenon is demonic, that it's evil.
They talk about angels and they see this
through the prism of evangelical
Christianity in particular. What do you
think of that take,
Sean? I was raised
Catholic. I never um voluntarily
participated
um in it. And as a young teenager, I I
made a proclamation that I would not
return to church. And I and I never did
unless it was a a wedding or a funeral
to be honest with you. Um I've had a
lous I had a lousy relationship with
with what we all call God up until
probably my late 30s early 40s when I
began meditating and when I began
understanding finally that if you were
willing to you could find the piece of
yourself that's more than flesh and that
at least in my for my experience it
wasn't connected to any dogma or faith.
And so then it became an investigation
of the various worlds religions and
their various practices and how do the
holy people of those sects interact with
their phenomena that they call
God. I think we're dealing with an a
universe that we have looked at in a
binary fashion that we look at as either
black or white off or on and
occasionally a small gray area in the
middle. But what we don't seem to
understand yet is that everything in
this universe is on a spectrum of some
kind. And whether it's light, energy,
matter, everything is vibrating. All of
those things are important distinctions
to
make. Everything is truly connected.
Even if we don't feel it or can't parse
how it's connected, if we can't see
those connections. The fractality of the
universe tells us that we are inside of
a system that we just call life. And
it's it's more complex than that. At the
end of the day, the phenomena seems to
understand it better than we do. Um, but
on that
spectrum, your personal brain waves,
body state, level of stress, level of
cortisol, they change how your brain
operates. They change whether it's
operating in beta, alpha, theta, gamma,
delta. All of which have different
meanings that most people won't know.
But some mean sleep, some mean alert and
stressed out, some mean relaxed, and
some mean incredible data processing.
Um, all people are in one of those
states at all times. And I believe that
when we are in what we tend to call a
low vibrational state, which could be
alcoholism, trauma, abuse, drug
addiction, depression, things like that,
our brain waves are operating at such a
lower frequency that I believe that
other things within this reality that,
as you said, we only see out of the
corner of our eye at that 45 degree
angle for a moment. Those things exist
with us. We don't understand them. And
some of those things bring negative
energy and feelings with them. Other
things, if you go in the other direction
and and try to bring the purity that's
talked about at the very core teachings
of our religions, if you try to truly
open your heart to selfless love and to
see the other as
yourself, there's a different thing
waiting at that end of the brainwave
spectrum that wants your attention. And
I think both of those things are
existing at the same time in our reality
and we tend to call them the phenomena.
And I'll wrap up by saying of the
thousands and thousands of anecdotal
reports that we've we've all the three
of us have seen and researched over the
years, we know that there are numerous
different shapes, sizes, morphologies,
bodies, languages, operations,
everything occurs differently. Although
there are things that are
similar, whatever this is, it's not one
source. And I think it would behoove the
three of us as perhaps as leaders in
this field or or as as people that will
be listened to to ensure that people
understand that though we say phenomena,
that is a plural, not a singular.
So Dean, have you had similar profound
senses of some kind of spiritual shove
behind the interviews that you've done
with these people? Yeah. When I started
out, I thought this is going to be an
informative um science documentary.
Well, I'm going to ground the
phenomenon. I thought I thought I was
going to debunk this bull story of UFOs
and get on with writing a book about US
secret technology. Sorry. That's what I
told Lou Alzando I wanted to help with.
I said, "If anybody's full of it from
the Princeton, let me know."
Forgive me, Sean. I interrupted. Sorry.
Forgive me, Dean. I apologize. No. So,
um, it it became this thing where I
realized, oh, this is part of my
journey.
I'm being of service. And that's always
been important to Sean and I is how can
we be of service? And so when I I look
at this and I look at all these people
that are going through this, I'm I'm
right where I should be. I I believe not
to prophesize this, but I'm I'm here to
to kind of uh shed light on it and maybe
add a piece to the puzzle that you're
adding, Ross, and others are adding. Um,
but I feel like it's it is something
that is
extremely profound on so many different
levels that it's kind of like again time
released. And so, as much as we want to
have all the answers and we want a UFO
tailpipe to be dropped on the next
congressional house hearing and go,
"Wow, here it is and here's a dead alien
arm." for the, you know, the thousands,
hundreds of thousands, who knows how
more experiencers, they've had that, you
know, communion with them. And so I I
feel like um I feel like it's part of
our evolution because we're going to be
doing that very same thing. We are going
to discover time travel. It's
inevitable. Einstein predicted it. And
and we're also going to be able to
discover new physics that are going to
take us to other dimensions of planets.
And so, you know, you got to respect the
prime directive, but there's certain
things that they're
doing that feels like they're almost
authors in our existence. And as Lou
would say, Lou Lou told me at that same,
you know, Comic-Con convention, he said,
"A portion of the generals he talks to
when he was briefing them say, you're
doing God's work, right? And another
portion says, you know, they're demons,
right?"
And so it comes down to the limitations
of one's imagination. And whenever I'm
because I'm a I'm a writer, I can't
afford to be too rigid, to be too
brittle, and to close up my toolbox and
say I have everything I need in here.
Can't do that. I have to be open to
everything. And so I found that the one
common denominator in all this is that
there is a spiritual component here
where they do want us to get to a
certain level where we are all not a you
know kind of like a hive mentality where
again it's we're all here experiencing
this wonderful thing. We are gifted. I
mean, I'm excited about find another
planet that's Earthlike, but the odds
that it's going to have the right um
gravity, the right sun, the right
distance, all these things, that's
perfect. We have something that is so
amazing. And so, at the end of these
seven years, I find myself looking at
these documentaries and realize that
there's two messages that came through
for me. One is to have empathy for the
experiencers. That needs to stop now.
Because you wouldn't say to someone who
got abducted by someone, you wouldn't
say, "Oh, was the van white or was it
black? Was there duct tape or rope?"
They do that with aliens. They go, "Oh,
was a ship? Was it triangular? Was it
whatever?" That stops now. And the
second thing is that our planet is this
amazing gift and we are connected with
it as much as as it is with us. and we
can destroy it as much as we think we
can, but it'll recycle. So, I'm more
worried about mankind. I want our race
at the end of the day to be the ones
that get to be fully evolved because if
we don't make it, there's going to be
another intelligence that's going to
come out of this. And so, it's it's uh
incumbent upon us to handle the
inheritance that we have and to and to
treat it right and to also enjoy that we
don't have all the answers. You know,
right now the aliens, if you will, at
human non-human intelligence, they are
giving us teers teasers and trailers to
a fantastic movie that we're eventually
going to get to see.
Well, Dean and Sean, I have a sense both
of you are right that that essentially
what's happening is we are being
twigged. Our consciousness is being
twigged by something, something sentient
and something intelligent. But as Sean
says, it's a journey that we have to
make as a spiritual journey on our own
in order to be able to comprehend it.
Thank you both of you for joining
reality check and I wish you the very
luck with your film, The Alien
Perspective. Just remind us again, Dean,
where can we watch it? Sure. You can see
on Amazon or Apple TV and uh I'll also
be posting about it on my Instagram at
Dean Aoto. And Sean, when are you going
to write a book? Come on, I want to hear
it.
I I'm receiving quite a bit of uh
encouragement to do so. Um I I've
considered it. Right now I'm mostly
focused on uh the company. I'm I've
started with some a few other people
called Project Nanu. Uh we're creating a
uh social media platform where people
who are experiencers or just generally
interested in the phenomena and other
mysteries of the world can unite and
share their evidence with each other. Um
we look forward to releasing that this
summer. But uh I appreciate the the poke
there. Maybe I'll uh maybe I'll let you
know if I start writing one. Thank you
