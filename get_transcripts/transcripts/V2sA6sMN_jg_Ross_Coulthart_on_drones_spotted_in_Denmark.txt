These incursions, whatever they are, may
not necessarily be drones.
There are people that have described to
me seeing orblike objects coming into
airspace and then in some way morphing
into shapes of aircraft. I have people
that have shown me images of what look
like the shapes of a 737 or a commercial
passenger jet moving at impossibly slow
speeds over parts of New Jersey and New
York. It's the same in Copenhagen.
Martin tells me that some of the
witnesses in Copenhagen estimated the
size of this object as the size of an
A380 aircraft, the largest commercial
passenger jet. Whatever these objects
are, I really think we're at the stage
where we need to stop swallowing and
just accepting glibly the explanations
from government agencies.
