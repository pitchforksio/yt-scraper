>> IF YOU FOLLOW THE UEFA WISH 
OR YOU HAVE PROBABLY NOTICED 
THAT MANY OF THE MOST 
COMPELLING ENCOUNTERS IN 
RECENT YEARS HAVE HAPPENED 
BETWEEN UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT AND 
U.S. NAVY ASSETS. THE FAMED 
USS NIMITZ, TIC TAC IS JUST 
ONE EXAMPLE. WHATEVER THEY 
ARE, THESE THINGS SEEM TO 
SPEND A LOT OF TIME AROUND 
WATER NOW THAT HAS FUELED 
SPECULATION THAT ALIENS MIGHT 
LIVING ON THE OCEAN FLOOR 
INSTEAD OF ABOVE OUR HEADS IN 
SPACE. THAT FASCINATING THEORY 
IS THE BASIS FOR THE LATEST 
NEWS NATIONS. SPECIAL REALITY 
CHECK WITH ROSS CALLED HEART 
UNDERWATER. UF OWES IT AIRS 
THIS SATURDAY AT 08:00PM 
EASTERN ROSS AND HIS TEAM 
INVESTIGATE REPORTS OF A 
MYSTERIOUS UNDERWATER HIGHWAY. 
YEAH, YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT. 
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF 
UNIDENTIFIED SUBMERSIBLE 
OBJECTS OR U.S. OWES HAVE THEY 
BEEN AS ARE CALLED HAVE BEEN 
SIGHTED OFF UNITED STATES 
SHORELINES MOST FREQUENTLY OFF 
THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. 
THAT'S WHERE THE TEAM MET OF 
BOAT CAPTAIN, WHO IS SPEAKING 
OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT 
HIS HARROWING ENCOUNTER WITH 
SEVERAL COLOR CHANGING OR 
>> THAT'S WHAT REALLY 
INTERESTS JUST WITH YOUR CASE 
BECAUSE HOW LONG WOULD YOU SAY 
THAT WHOLE DURATION FROM WHEN 
YOU SAW THESE THINGS? YOU HAVE 
A COUPLE MINUTES ON THAT 
VIDEO. BUT IF YOU WERE TO SAY 
FROM START TO STOP ON ONE SET 
OF THOSE ORANGE, A SLIGHT, HOW 
LONG WERE THEY UP IN THE 
PROBABLY AS 
>> FLYING CLOSE MY BOAT FOR 
ABOUT 10 MINUTES. THERE'S SOME 
SMALLER ONES OFF IN THE 
DISTANCE. YOU DON'T SEE THE 
VIDEO, BUT 
>> IT START OUT LIKE AS 3 
SAID, WERE CLOSE TOGETHER LIKE 
IN A TRIANGULAR PATTERN AND 
THEY'D ALL KIND BEING THEY 
WERE CHANGING COLORS FROM RED, 
BLACK, ORANGE. AND SOMEWHERE 
SIT ON BALL STUFF AND THEY 
WOULD MERGE TOGETHER AS ONE 
AND THEN THEY'D SPLIT OFF 
THEIR BE 2 OF THEM. THEN 
THERE'D BE ONE. THEN THERE BE 
3 OF THEM AND CERTAIN POINTS 
THEY JUST DISAPPEARED 
ALTOGETHER. AND WE'RE JUST 
REAPPEAR. THEY DROP DOWN CLOSE 
TO THE WATER LIKE RIGHT ABOVE 
THE WATER AND STARTED COMING 
TOWARDS ME. 
>> ALL RIGHT. HERE TO PREVIEW 
HIS SPECIAL IS ROSS CALLED 
TARP ROSS. GREAT TO HAVE YOU 
BACK ON THE SHOW. 
>> SO WHAT IS WHAT IS IT ABOUT 
THE COAST OFF CALIFORNIA? 
WHY'D YOU THINK WE HAVE SO 
MANY REPORTED ENCOUNTERS 
THERE. 
>> HELLO, ELIZABETH. I DON'T 
THINK IT'S A COINCIDENCE THAT 
CALIFORNIA INTO SOME OF THE 
BIGGEST AEROSPACE COMPANIES IN 
AMERICA. AND IT'S ALSO 
PROBABLY THE CLOSEST POINT 
WHERE, IF YOU WILL, NORM HUMAN 
CIVILIZATION, YOU COULD HIDE 
YOURSELF VERY SUCCESSFULLY AND 
THOUSANDS OF METERS OF WATER 
WITH A REASONABLE DEGREE OF 
CERTAINTY THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE 
DETECTED THE AS WE KNOW, 
THERE'S HUGE GULF, SOME WATER 
JUST OFF THE COAST OF 
CALIFORNIA. THE BAJA, 
CALIFORNIA AREA, OR IS WE THE 
U.S. NIMITZ INCIDENT HAPPENED 
IN 2004 AND WE KNOW WILL SIDE 
OF THAT IS BEING REPEATED 
SIGHTINGS OF THE NORMAL U.S. 
PHENOMENON OF TRUST THAT BOAT 
CAPTAINS STORE. BUT MANY, MANY 
DOZENS, IN FACT, HUNDREDS OF 
SIGHTINGS HAVE TAKEN PLACE 
AROUND CATALINA ISLAND JUST 
OFF THE COAST OF A LIE. AND I 
GUESS MANY SPECULATING HERE. 
BUT IF YOU WILL, THE AND 
CIVILIZED NATION, YOU 71% OF 
DEPENDENTS. IF THIS IS WATER 
AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A 
NEW TRIAL ENVIRONMENT THAT 
SAID TEMPERATURE CONSISTENT, 
WE'D LOVE TO LIGHT. WE YOU 
WANT TO HIDE IF THERE IS ALIEN 
SPECIES TARGETING THIS KIND A 
LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THERE IS, 
INCLUDING SITTING CONGRESSMAN, 
THAT WOULD BE THE PLACE TO 
HIDE. YEAH. AND IT'S I'VE 
NOTED ON THE SHOW BEFORE. 
>> 27% OF THE OCEAN IS MAPPED 
OUT BY HUMANS. WE ONLY KNOW 
WE'VE MAPPED OUT 27% OF OUR 
OCEANS. WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THE 
SERVICE OF MARS AND THE 
SURFACE OF THE MOON WE DO 
ABOUT OUR OWN OCEANS. 
>> THAT'S SO TRUE. AND 
ELIZABETH, I'LL TELL YOU, I'VE 
SPOKEN TO SUB MARINERS WHO 
WORKING OUT OF THE SUBMARINE 
FLEET WITH NUCLEAR SUBMARINES 
UP NEAR SEATTLE. IT AND 
THEY'VE TOLD ME THAT RECORDED 
AN ANOMALOUS PHENOMENA MOVING 
FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF SOUND 
AND THE WATER LIKE THAT'S 
THAT'S THAT'S IT. FASTER THAN 
1000 NOTES UNDER WATER. WE 
DON'T HAVE AY CROFT IN THE 
HUMAN 
>> TECHNOLOGY THAT PRESSURE 
THAT THE WATER PRESSURE THAT 
TO TO IT. HARD TO SWIM IN THE 
OCEAN AND KNOW, YOU CAN'T 
ACROSS THE SWIMMIMING POL ALL 
VERY FAST. YOU THE WAY YOU CAN 
RUN ON GROUND. IT IS HARD TO 
MOVE FAST AT ALL AND EROSION. 
>> YES, SO WE HAVE THIS VERY 
SILLY SITUATION WHERE EVEN 
UNDER THE CURRENT 
ADMINISTRATION, THERE'S A KIND 
OF A DENIAL ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF NORMAL HUMAN 
INTELLIGENCE OR CHAI. BUT THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING FORWARD 
TO ME INTO BEING HENSON IN 
THIS STORY, I BASICALLY PEOPLE 
WHO'VE WORKED ON THE WATER 
AROUND CATALINA RUN WE'VE 
SPOKEN TO PEOPLE IN THE 
MILITARY AND THERE IS OF FAST 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 
WILLING TO GO ON THE RECORD TO 
SITE. THEY HAVE WITNESSED A 
NORMAL US PHENOMENA. I'M WALL 
TO DOING EXTRAORDINARY THINGS 
AT JUST A YES OR NO ANSWER 
BECAUSE IT WILL BE A TEASER. 
BUT 
>> DO THEIR STORIES IS IT? ARE 
THEY DESCRIBING THE SAME THING 
OR A BUNCH OF DIFFERENTHINGS 
THAT THEY'RE SAYING VERY MUCH 
THE SAME THING. OKAY. VERY 
MUCH. THE VERY, VERY 
INTERESTING. AND BY THE WAY, 
TO YOUR POINT THAT CALIFORNIA 
IS THE HOME TO SO MANY 
MILITARY BASES. WE KNOW THAT 
MANY OF THE UFO SIGHTINGS ON 
FACILITIES OR SENSITIVE AR 
INSTALLATIONS. SO 
>> ROSS CALLED HEART. THANKS 
SO MUCH. THE SPECIAL UIS FO'S
