Good day and welcome back to Reality
Check. I'm your host, Ross Kulart, and
today the first in a series of
interviews we're going to be running
with some of the people who featured in
our recent Arizona Border special. Bob
Thompson is an Army veteran who served
for 14 years with the US Customs and
Border Protection as part of the Tucson,
Arizona sector's special operations
detachment mobile response team focusing
on counterterrorism and drug
interdiction. He eventually became part
of the Arizona Air Coordination Center,
which monitors the airspace along the US
border with Mexico. And it's in the
course of that important work that he
came across evidence of anomalous
objects recorded and tracked by
surveillance aircraft, including what
has become known as the rubber ducky.
Inside Border Patrol, Bob became
concerned that his superiors weren't
that concerned about these unexplained
objects hovering near the border.
Because surely, if there is anything
like that in our airspace, it should be
a national security concern. if
unidentified objects are hovering in our
airspace near the border. He wrote a
report for his bosses detailing what he
discovered and eventually he got
permission to share what he'd
discovered. It's rare to get an insider
with Bob Thompson's knowledge and
experience to go on the record. This is
the first time he's allowed himself to
be identified publicly. And today you
can see those videos and hear his full
story on record for the first time.
Here's Bob
Thompson. Bob, let's establish your
credentials. Who are you? What was your
role in Border Protection? So, I am a
retired Border Patrol agent. I worked
for the United States Border Patrol for
14 years. and I worked on uh my last
assignment was with the special
operations detachment in the Tucson
sector border patrol. Uh I started in
January of 2008 and uh retired in uh
January of
2022. During that time I served on
different uh special operations teams at
the station level, including ATVs,
mountain teams, uh border awareness and
intelligence teams. And like I said, the
last part of it, I was flying uh for the
border patrol and also had the ability
to help out uh and start out a uh a
system that they called the air
coordination center. So that was uh
something that was going to involved all
the flight stuff that that was in the
Tucson sector border patrol. Your job
required you to have a security
clearance. Absolutely. You had a top
secret SCI clearance? Nope. Just a
regular uh classified uh top secret.
You were a respected border patrol. Yes,
sir. Yeah, I worked as a uh paramedic on
a special operations detachment for a
group called the mobile response team,
which is one of the three tiers of the
special operations for border patrol.
So, uh I was kind of our team medic, the
the only paramedic that we had on that
uh team. So, I I had the the ability to
take care of both the bad guys and the
good guys. Before you got into this
topic, what was the attitude inside the
border patrol organization to the
subject of unidentified anomalous
phenomena? I would say non-existent.
Non-existent. There wasn't any attitude
because no one really discussed it
openly. So, what got you into it? Me
personally, I was always interested in
the topic and had, you know, I've had
sightings of of anomalous objects myself
all throughout my life. On the job as
well. On the job as well. Yes. What did
you see? I've seen orbs. I've seen
strange lights that were, you know, just
bright and hovering, uh, takeoff stuff
that maybe was could have been
satellites that moved in ways that
weren't like satellites. A lot of stuff
at night and we also had the ability to
use, uh, some of the technology to see
some of these things as well. So, where
you were operating is quite an
interesting and unusual area. you you
were operating along the border with
Mexico, ensuring the border was secure,
but you were also adjacent to some key
military air training ranges, weren't
you? That's correct. We were uh
responsible for areas that included the
Berry Goldwater range and a lot of the
military uh uh areas of operation along
the border, our air corridors, flight
path for jets that come down from uh
Luke Air Force Base, Davis Mountain Air
Force Base uh and the Yuma Yuma uh
activities as well out with the Marines.
So there's vast areas, remote parts of
Arizona which are being used by the Air
Force and other military agencies to
train military pilots. That's correct.
Using uh all kinds of different
platforms that we would see while we
flew out there and in the middle of all
of this, you're flying there with what
kind of aircraft and what kind of
capabilities? Well, the ones that I
mainly flew on were helicopters. So when
I was flying with the National Guard, we
flew on the UH72 Lakota, which is a kind
of a standard utility helicopter for the
uh air or the Army National Guard. We
also flew on the UH60 Blackhawk
helicopters doing uh apprehension stuff
as well as fixed wings that involved the
RC26 Metro Liner and uh Hueies as well,
UH1 Hueies. And what kind of kit do you
have on those helicopters so that our
audience can understand the capabilities
without giving away any national
security issues? What kind of things can
these equipment do? Well, they have the
ability of seeing in the dark and seeing
different uh thermal uh spectrums with
things. So the the common terminology
that a lot of people hear is is the
fleer, the forward-looking infrared. So,
uh, some of those platforms had cameras
on board that, uh, utilize a sensor
operator to look for, uh, targets that
were on the ground as in or in the air.
So, you've got sophisticated
surveillance gear. Absolutely. It allows
you to look on the ground and in the
air. And in addition, you had the pilots
wear NVGs as well as the crew members as
well. So, they're explain what NVGs are.
Night vision goggles. And what are they?
They're they give you the ability to see
in the dark.
Okay. So, you've got a pretty formidable
amount of equipment there that allows
you to see what's out there. That's
correct. What is out there? Well, me
personally, I've seen, like I said, orbs
that were off in the distance. I've seen
uh craft that were cigar- shaped. I've
seen triangles myself. I've never been
able to record them personally, but, you
know, with videos that I have seen from
other agents show some of that stuff.
Now, during your role in border
protection, there came a time when you
suggested to your superiors that you
start preparing some kind of research
report into what was being seen. I did
when I uh when I was working for what
they call the Arizona Air Coordination
Center. Uh I was uh kind of solicited
for uh the ability to put together a
report, what they call an issue paper uh
and and get that subject kind of on the
record. and we were having incidences
where the potential could be there for a
a strike from say a a small UAS and it
kind of fit into that program. So So
there was a concern among pilots, safety
concerns that there might be a collision
with these objects they were seeing.
There could be, but we were also
operating what they call small uh UAS's
or small unmanned aerial surveillance
vehicles. So this is an important issue.
Not only is this a a national security
issue because you've got unknown objects
operating not only in secure military
areas but along the border with Mexico,
there's also a flight safety issue.
Well, and like I said, there's there's
so many platforms that are down and
around out there, but the aircraft have
their their safety systems that they
worry about, but you also have, like I
said, you have guys on the ground,
border patrol agents that are operating,
you know, their drone surveillance uh as
well in the apprehension of How many
agents did you end up speaking to in
Border Protection who had seen anomalous
objects? At least a hundred. At least a
hundred. Wow. And a lot of those are,
you know, personal friends and stuff as
well. So, and what sort of things were
they telling you? Well, uh, for example,
small triangles is, you know, something
that we we haven't really heard a lot
about. Maybe, uh, Jeremy Corbel reported
some of those small triangles that were
hovering above the ships. These were
small triangles that were flying over
agents. In addition to that, they had
uh, and just so I'm large triangles.
Were those small triangles, whatever
size they were, were they showing any
visible means of propulsion? Nope. when
they were showing on flur forward
looking infrared, was there any visible
heat source? I'm not aware of anyone
tracking any of the small triangles on
Fleer, but that they may have seen them
with the night vision goggles. Uh I know
for a fact that one of the guys looked
at these things with night vision
goggles and he didn't see any type of
propulsion or anything on them. They
were just kind of silently moving around
the desert. So this is being discussed
inside border protection amongst the
guys. Yes. As an issue of concern. Well,
and speculation as to what they could be
as well. I don't think anyone that I
came across from a ground agent uh
standpoint thought they were a safety
concern. You know, for them it became
more of a concern for the stuff that was
flying around in the air. The pilots had
more of a concern for any more about
than anything. You mentioned some of
these agents were also seeing larger
black triangles. Large black triangles.
You mentioned some of these agents were
also seeing larger triangles. That's
correct. Uh I have a personal friend
that was out west of uh or east of Yuma,
Arizona, out on patrol out there and had
a very large triangle fly over him.
Silent. The way he described it was at
least 100 feet maybe 50 to 100 ft wide.
Silent flying right over him. No lights
on. Nighttime. Nighttime using night
vision goggles. No, he's No, they saw it
uh personally without anything right
over the top of them. I mean that by
definition is extraordinary. I mean,
it's it's unusual. It's a craft of some
kind. It's a craft, but like like we've
talked about already, there is a large
military training area out there. So,
could it be something that the military
was testing? It's a distinct
possibility. But when he saw that large
black triangle, did he hear any noise?
No. Silent. Did he see a propulsion
system? No propulsion system. And it
wasn't just him. There was two people
out there that saw it at the same time.
And you spoke to both of them? I didn't
get to speak to the other one. The other
one was his friend. But how often were
the witnesses that you spoke to
corroborated by other agents? A lot of
times there were multiple agents that
saw stuff at the same time. I have a
story about a supervisor that I was with
that we saw stuff come out of the sky uh
down in Cenoida. Two two objects came
down uh they were just lights came
straight down out of the sky and then
moved horizontally and disappeared
behind some mountains. Both of us were
sitting there in a truck and nei neither
of us could come to an explanation of
what what that was. So I'm not making
any criticism of you here, but you're
part of Homeland Security when you're
working for border protection, aren't
you? You are. I'm retired now. I just
want to make that. Yes. So So this is
after
9/11. Protecting our borders is
sacrosanct.
Absolutely. An unknown by definition is
a threat. Absolutely. So what was going
on inside the organization when agents
were reporting this to you as part of
your research? Well, I explained that I
was gathering information in a certain
sense, but I also made it very personal
because it was, you know, it was
something that the agents didn't freely
talk about. So if I shared experiences
that I had, you know, it seemed you
could open up agents to have them kind
of share their experiences. I knew I
wasn't the only one that saw things out.
I just want to explore that with you.
So, they didn't want to talk about it.
No one likes to talk about it freely.
Why? I think it's just still a taboo
subject because Sorry. I'm sorry. By
definition, though, if you see a
gigantic 100 ft craft black triangle of
some kind hovering over you in the
desert in the middle of Arizona, that's
a national security issue, isn't it?
Consensus being, you know, that being a
training range, I think there's a lot of
agents that think that may be just, you
know, stuff that we're flying ourselves.
So, but you can't make that assumption.
You can't make that assumption. It
wasn't hostile. Put it that way. If
these guys were describing hostile
events to them, I think we would be
having a different conversation. But, I
mean, but they're not. Most of them are
just sightings that occur, you know, and
they're they're kind of non non-events.
They'll see something that flies over.
Sure, it's a safety concern, but, you
know, it's not a concern for the agents
at the time. But I mean, if a plane load
of al-Qaeda terrorists was coming over
the border, you guys would be hot to
trot. You'd be pulling all the alarms.
You'd be making sure that whatever the
hell it is, it's stopped. We'd certainly
be making the notifications to the right
people. I don't think the border patrol
is capable of combating, you know,
Taliban, but that we would make the
appropriate notifications. But you
understand what I'm saying here. I mean,
there's this huge issue. Hundreds of
reports.
Agents are seeing these things.
And I I would have thought there was an
obligation to report them. The the
problem was we didn't have any uh
reporting requirements for that if it
didn't have a nexus to smuggling. Ross,
I don't think uh anyone wanted to say on
the record that they had seen a large
triangle flying over them. And who would
you report that to? What What is the
There wasn't a means there wasn't a
means to report it. Now, the thing that
really struck me, and forgive me,
Miguel, if I go on this diversion, but
it's important. Go right ahead, please.
Um,
are you aware that the US Air Force was
also seeing strange objects on these
ranges? Only through open source media.
I was aware of of the uh Drive published
in a article about stuff that they saw
out in the West Desert training uh area,
which really corresponded to what our
pilots were seeing as well.
So, I am aware of that. I mean, what's
interesting is the war zone uh uh which
is an excellent online periodical, it
reported on what it described as drone
swarms over not just training areas, but
the Paulo Verde nuclear plant in Arizona
multiple times in September 2019. So
something, whatever it is, is hovering
over an extremely sensitive nuclear
facility. Was that an issue in Homeland
Security to border protection? Well,
nuclear power plants are a little
outside our purview, but stuff along the
border certainly was. I never had anyone
say that they reported drone swarms.
Most of the reports that I saw were
singular loan items or loan objects.
There was also commercial reports coming
in. It was the crew of an American
Airlines uh flight and a Phoenix Air
Charter business jet. They reported an
encounter with a UAP in the southern
part of the state on the border with New
Mexico the year before. I mean, this is
amazing. There's stuff all the time in
the skies over Arizona. There's
obviously something going on in Arizona
along the border areas more than just uh
illegal immigration.
One of the things I was really impressed
with was the fact that the war zone
obtained on FOI safety reports from the
US Air Force which showed that on one
occasion one of these objects hit the
cockpit window of an F-16 fighter
jet. Have you ever heard of those kind
of incidents? I have not heard of that
personally. I don't know if I'd be
perview to the Air Force's uh uh safety
reports and and I don't remember any uh
open source information about that
specific event you were talking about.
But we did you approach the Air Force at
all? No, we did not have a a
relationship per se with the Air Force.
At least I didn't. I know we had
military liaison that worked for uh
Tucson sector. That might have been in
their wheelhouse, but it wasn't in mine.
But this is what worries me is the whole
lesson from 9/11 was that you had
individual agencies finding out things
about the al-Qaeda terrorists and not
sharing it with other agencies. And I'm
not saying this is a terrorist incident
what we're talking about here, but
you've got homeland security becoming
aware of strange anomalous objects in
the skies. You've got the Air Force FOID
safety reports talking about anomalous
objects in the skies. They call them
UAS's or drones, but there doesn't
appear to be any evidence that they are
identified as drones. Um, and some of
these objects are operating at 17,000,
20,000, 33,000, 36,000 ft. Does any
known drone operate at that fe? None
that I know of. At least when I was
working for the Border Patrol, we did
not have any drones that went that high
uh that uh were commercial, small, or
otherwise for the most part. We we did
have other uh uh surveillance platforms
that flew for uh Department of Homeland
Security, but they weren't tied to any
type of, you know, drone that moved in a
quadcopter type fashion or otherwise.
And and here's another uh US Air Force
report which was obtained on FOI. March
2021, two pilots and F-35s are flying
near Casa Grande in Arizona between
Phoenix and Tucson. They report seeing a
large white
UAS stationary at 24,000
ft. It's pretty interesting. That was
probably on the route down to the Berry
Goldwater range or heading south. That
would be my guess. That's a little far
north of the border. Casagran's a little
bit further north from where we were at,
but uh it's still in the general area.
They were probably in route down to uh
the training zone. But what's
interesting is there are things called
haters, hazardous air traffic reports,
which have been obtained by journalists
from the US Air Force. And there's a
succession. In fact, there's a blizzard
of reports from the US Air Force talking
about how F-35 jets have had to
evasively maneuver to avoid clusters of
small UAP objects or UAS objects at
ridiculous altitudes, 20,000, 30,000 ft.
These don't sound like commercial or
even known military drones, do they? No,
they don't.
And and typically the Border Patrol
agents aren't looking up at they're not
looking straight up at 30,000 ft or
25,000 ft either. So that would be
definitely out of their uh kind of line
of sight for the most part. What I find
fascinating is the Air Force, the US Air
Force is clearly seeing the same things
as your colleagues were, your agents in
the Border Protection Force with
Homeland Security. And nobody's talking
to each other. It's it's a mystery.
There's a a a fighter pilot from the um
the US Air Force who puts in a hazardous
air traffic report. At 21,000 ft, he
sees a small black metallic object.
That's all it says.
It's never explained. And yet, we know
these things are operating in secure air
training areas adjacent to the border
with Mexico.
By definition, that's a national
security flight safety concern, isn't
it? I would think so.
So, I think I've made the point that I
wanted to make with the Air Force
reports. Basically, there's an
independent series of corroborative
reports which prove that what your
Border Patrol officers were seeing was
being corroborated at the same time by
the US Air
Force. Now, in my book, that's what we
call data evidence. True. I would say
so.
So, what happens? You write your report.
I didn't get a chance to finish my
report, Ross, because I had to medically
retire from the Border Patrol. So, I'm
hoping that got carried on and someone
was able to help get get reporting
requirements into operation within the
Tucson sector. We do know that the
Department of Homeland Security at a
very very high level was considering
beginning its own investigations into
UAPs because we know it's now official
that there were
approaches by people who were concerned
about this issue from defense that this
should be
investigated. There was a push inside
DHS to begin an investigation and it was
allegedly shut down.
Does it concern you that this was shut
down? I think yes, because I think the
Department of Homeland Security could
have a pivotal role in maybe an early
warning for, you know, something like
this occurring. If there are, you know,
as we have, you know, shown stuff flying
around in the skies of Arizona that we
don't know what it is. I think it's
imperative that someone do, you know,
try to discover what this is. And if if
the Department of Homeland Security
could play a role in doing that, I I
would I can't see why you would exclude
them from that. Well, the Department of
Homeland Security was conceived out of a
national tragedy. Yes. And the reason
why that national tragedy 9/11 occurred,
miscommunication. We were asleep at the
wheel. Sleep at the wheel. Intelligence
agencies weren't talking to each other.
That's right. And Prima, what you're
telling me is proof of that. That's
right. I know you hadn't finished your
report, but what were your impressions?
What were your conclusions at the point
where you'd gathered all this data? I
think I was at the point that it was a
safety concern uh for stuff that was
flying around out there. I was more
concerned about our pilots and and my
team members that were flying aboard
these aircraft and making sure that they
were safe. if they saw something that
was a a near miss or close encounter, I
wanted them to be able to report it and
and and have that data flow to the right
resources that could possibly use it.
That was, you know, my only goal was the
safety considerations. Now, as I
understand it, your security
classification gave you access to video
archives. I did I did a lot of data
mining looking for uh you know uh videos
that would support the case as to why we
need these reporting requirements. So
you have to build a case and that was
basically what that issue paper is doing
is is making a case for why we need to
do something like this. And I think that
the the data showed that there were
things that were flying around out there
along the border that were a concern
that uh probably should be on people's
radar. And by by definition, let's be
clear about this. You weren't skulking
around the archives improperly. You had
authorization to make the I had I had
access to all the all the uh information
that I needed to. Not as much as I'd
like to, but I found a fair amount that
supported the case I was trying to make
with that report. So, your bosses were
supportive, I would say. Yes. And this
is this is around about the time as I
understand it when the independent
office of the uh director of national
intelligence
oi 2021 they published a
report acknowledging that UAP's
unidentified anomalous phenomena are
real.
That's correct. and he also uh made the
recommendation that they would re there
would be reporting requirements
established at the same time as well. So
preemptively I started working uh on
that for Tucson sector at least. So you
you had support from your bosses inside
border protection and more importantly
again the office of the director of
national intelligence was an office that
was set up to deal with the catastrophe
the failures of 911.
It was an intelligence zar above the
defense department, above the
intelligence community, entrusted with
protecting America. Correct. That's
correct. And so ODNI were saying this is
real. And it was all government
agencies. It wasn't just specific ones,
but it was mandating, we want reporting.
That's correct. We want officers and
agencies to report this. That's correct.
And you did. I did.
So there came a time when you came
across a cluster of videos that you
thought were important. There was I had
enough evidence I thought and asked
around whether I could use these or show
these in any form or fashion and I got a
verbal uh permission. It might not have
been the way the government uh releases
stuff but at that time I I show I I
asked permission to show them to
friends, family, other people and you
know use them for this report and I was
given permission. Were the videos
carrying any kind of top secret or above
classification? There are stuff in those
videos that are law enforcement
sensitive and I made uh sure to to uh
take care with that stuff. So you acted
responsibly. At no stage did you do
anything that breached your security
oath.
I would say no.
Good. You made a decision to provide
those videos to a colleague, didn't you?
I did. I met uh a guy by the name of
Annie Marshall and who ran a uh social
media account and showed him those
videos. He he was one of the ones that
got to see those. Why did you do that? I
just believed in what he was doing. He
uh he ran a very interesting social
media uh platform. Uh he was very uh
thorough in looking at all the videos. I
thought he used discernment. He was a
tough talking New Yorker and I thought
he was the perfect person to show these
to and and I got a you know wanted to
also get a different opinion about what
they may be from a civilian perspective
as well. As a member of the media, can I
ask why didn't you go to the media?
Well, at the time, uh, I think they were
reporting it in a, uh, different way
than I was comfortable with releasing
them to. There was a sensationalism
about it, and I didn't want it to be
wrapped up in in any, uh, biased or
sensational piece of news. Were you
worried that the media wouldn't be
taking these seriously? I mean, there
seems to be a sad history of media
ridiculing and stigmatizing. Well, that
that, too. And there's also the fact
that these videos don't show some of the
profound things that have been, you
know, labeled such as the five
observables. One of them does, one of
the videos does show that, but the other
ones uh don't show those direct five
observables, which you know gives you
pause and and kind of boxes them in in a
sense. and and I I felt they were
profound enough and didn't show anything
that the majority of the people that I
showed them to could recognize being
drones or balloons or birds or
otherwise. So, what characterized these
videos? Why had they been kept by border
protection? Well, they weren't
necessarily kept. They were kind of just
archived. Like I said, anything that's
going to have a nexus to smuggling, our
guys would would want to know about,
right? So, if it's a drone carrying a
narcotics load or otherwise, that would
be something that they would use to uh,
you know, change our tactics as well.
So, I can imagine there are a lot of
cartel drones, organized crime drones
coming over the border. Apparently,
there are now. Yes. I'm far removed.
Would you say that you and your
colleagues were pretty damn good at
picking a drone from any other type of
object? I would say all the agents were
good at that. Not just the guys that I
worked with, but the guys that operated
the cameras in the air and the guys that
operated the cameras on the ground. Yes.
The crucial thing is that with the
forward-looking infrared, you can see
whether it's a drone. You can. They have
distinct signatures that allow you to
make that determination. What is it
about a drone that makes it so
distinguishable? Well, they have
engines, you know, that generate heat.
So you're able to see the signatures of
these uh you know vehicles by how they
are propelled through the air. Without
giving away any national security
secrets, how far away an object can you
see with these systems, these incredible
optics in miles? Miles. And you were
seeing strange objects. Absolutely.
Hundreds of objects that couldn't be
explained. Well, there was reports from
agents of hundreds of objects that they
couldn't explain. Me personally, I've
only seen, you know, a handful at a
time, but the other pilots and stuff
that I worked with, you know, would
equal up to that. Yes. But you began to
realize there was a pattern of anomalous
objects that couldn't be explained.
That's correct. They weren't
drones. They weren't
balloons. What were they? Well, some of
them were mundane objects. Some of them
were balloons. You ruled those out.
Well, believe it or not, you know, those
myar balloons float long distances.
You'll find those things out in the
middle of nowhere sometimes. So, those
are a concern as well, but we've seen
those. We know what those look like.
We've seen them flying through the air.
These were things that weren't known
that that didn't have the signature of
of balloons, whether they were latex or
myar.
So, what did Andy do with the videos?
Andy put them out there and uh released
them to the public. And what happened?
He he he took a lot of heat for doing
so. He really did. There was a lot of
people that thought these just showed
mundane objects.
How did you respond to that? I
personally didn't respond. Andy was the
one that responded and
uh his social media platforms were
attacked. He he he was attacked by the
general public with comments and
disparaging remarks. So, the pair of you
made a decision to do something, didn't
you? We did. It was I I I I felt good
about giving those to Andy's, but when I
gave them to Andy, it was more of a
gift. I washed my hands at them at that
point in time. It was just something for
the public to see. What was the reaction
inside Border Protection when it became
public that these videos were now
sitting on a server for the public to
see? Well, you're you're talking about
the uh August uh 2023.
Oh, no. Sorry. I'm talking about when
Andy got the videos. He posted them
pretty quickly. I I never heard. I was
actually employed while some of those
were being released. So I never heard
Were your bosses hostile? No, they
weren't hostile at all. So there's no
cover up inside Border Protection. Your
bosses aren't covering up for some dark
program. No, not at all. They were
supportive of your UAP investigations.
Well, I don't know if they were
supportive. The the the main boss that I
was working for that put me on this
task, he was ultimately in control who I
was developing this product for, right?
So he was supportive of him. Crucially,
nobody's trying to shut you down. No
one's trying to shut me down. And when
Andy put those videos up online, I was
never disciplined for him. Nobody told
you off. No one told me off. Well, full
marks and credit to Border Protection
for having the courage as a public
organization to support a good officer
like yourself. Well, I was happy to help
the the public in doing so. Was it a
difficult decision? It was, I think,
always in the back of your mind. uh you
know accessing a government computer and
doing what I did is is obviously you
know not something that's done on a
regular basis there there people have
taken cell phone videos of government
computers you can you can find those out
so that weighed on me heavily uh you
know for one I didn't want to be in
trouble for national security violations
in any form or or fashion but I wasn't
doing it for nefarious purposes Rob I
was doing it for safety safety
considerations why did you do it for
safety considerations. Ross, that was,
like I said, I felt strongly. I flew
personally as well, and I didn't want to
have a strike with one of these, just
like what you described with the F-16.
You were concerned somebody might get
killed. Absolutely. Absolutely.
So, the blowback continued from the
skeptics and the debunkers. They did.
They uh you get the gamut of stuff. It's
birds, it's balloons, it's drones. I
have to admit at this time I remember
reading about it and thinking the rubber
duck video looked ridiculous and I
remember thinking oh well it's just
rubbish and then what did you do? You
made a decision to refer it on to
another group. Absolutely. And that was
that was done by uh Andy. Andy had the
foresight to be able to if he was going
to release these, he wanted to release
these or release the rubber duck in the
right way and it was sent off to the
scientific coalition for unexplained
aerial phenomenon. So that went and was
was peer-reviewed by their guys
specifically by Peter Reali and he
generated a report. That report was
going to get stuck into my report that
was going to go to my boss but
unfortunately I retired uh before it was
complete. Your health issues? I do have
health issues. Are they related to the
job you've been doing? I can't say they
are. Not at least not for the border
patrol.
But it's taken a toll on you. Your
health. It has taken a toll on me. Has
whistleblowing taken a toll on you? It
has. It has. I I personally am divorced
now. I live in a different state than,
you know, I I I'm from Tucson. I I now
live in a a different state because of
it. Sir, I hope one day there comes a
time in America where people like you
who've had the courage to come forward
are properly recognized and honored. I
appreciate that, sir. Thank you. Did you
explore the possibility in the course of
your research that what you were seeing
were black projects, secret US weapons
or aerospace programs? Oh, certainly
that was always, you know, one of the
possibilities that one of these videos
could have been. We could it could have
been a capture of you know US technology
for sure. And I don't think any of us
want to jeopardize a national security
imperative. If we do have 100 foot wide
black triangles that can operate with
any without any visible means of
propulsion. I like the idea that it's
America that's got it. I I like that as
well. Did anybody ever come to you when
you were doing your research knowing
that you were doing this work for border
protection and say, "Look, in the
interests of national security, we ask
you to stop." No. And as a matter of
fact, Ross, I got more uh videos. It it
when the first one came, I got made
aware of another one and then another
one popped up. So people were kind of
relieved for the first time they were
being allowed to talk about this issue.
I think so. I think you know all of
those videos show something you for the
most part different. And as an operator
of those cameras, you don't know what
they are. So, you don't want to call
agents over there if if you know, for
example, the the Lab Bruha video, it
looks like a a a witch cruising through
the through the desert. What are you
going to what are you going to tell an
agent? Can you go over there and look at
this witch that's cruising through the
desert? It that's you know, that's
something that uh you know, agents have
to come to terms with, you know, and if
one of these things went down out in the
desert, the Border Patrol agents might
be the first one out there as well. So,
I'm jumping ahead a little bit here, but
I'm interested to know, you saw the
David Grush revelations that came out in
June 2023. I did. What was your take? I
was flabbergasted just like anyone else
was. And and knowing that the government
may have uh nonhuman intelligence or
craft of other uh dimensions, planets or
otherwise, is is is fairly exciting,
intriguing, and and uh disturbing at the
same time. The allegations that David
made were essentially that there is a
non-human intelligence that's been
engaging with this planet for a very
long time. The US is secretly aware of
it. It's been
recovering alien non-human
technology and somewhere in America,
it's got facilities where it's secretly
attempting to backgineer it. It's
extraordinary allegations. Those are
extraordinary allegations for sure. When
you heard that
though, did it put some things together
in your mind about what you had been
hearing about from your operatives in
the field in the border protection?
Well, absolutely. Especially being in a
military training area, you have to test
that technology out in some form or
fashion. You're not going to be flying
it over large cities for the most part.
At least that would be my impression.
So, where else would you fly it on a
military training range that's vast and
wide? But why would they test machinery
such advanced technology when they
surely know that they're a border
protection aircraft with sophisticated
imagery systems? What better place to do
it with guys that have security
clearances already? But wouldn't they
have tried to shut you down if they'd
known that you were doing this research?
I can't speculate as to what their
intentions would be. David's allegation
is that there is an incredibly
secret operation known as the
program where the United States is
trying to backineer this technology,
this alien technology in secret
facilities. Do you find that even
remotely plausible?
Well, with the reports of the agents and
the things that I've seen, it's
certainly possible, especially where we
see the items at or see the objects at
the objects out on the anytime you see
any of that stuff on a uh military
reservation or or bombing
range. It certainly could be uh our own
technology. Now, we're not going to go
through each individual uh video here,
but I do want to talk with you about the
findings that were made by SCU about the
rubber duck video, okay? Because that's
the primary focus of the SCU report.
What did they determine? They determined
that the rubber duck was an anomalous
object. They couldn't explain it. They
ruled out drones. They ruled out drones.
They ruled out balloons. We actually had
a a 20 plus year Fleer Depot level
technician do a pretty good analysis of
it as well. He's seen every gamut of
what you could possibly see on Fleer.
Looked at it from different perspectives
as well. And it it knows how those
cameras work very intricately. So he
couldn't figure out what it was either.
Did it stop the debunkers and the
skeptics? Nope. They continued on. They
continued on the uh with the attack. And
I think it only stopped until that SCU
report came out. When the SCU report
made its findings that the rubber duck
video was genuinely anomalous, did that
put an end or did it slow the level of
criticism from the skeptics and
debunkers? I would say yes. I mean, I I
wasn't actively involved in in social
media, but I did monitor Andy's uh
Instagram account, and it it seemed to
it brought a lot of vindication for what
we had put forward. Can I ask you this?
Do you think it's understood in
mainstream media and authoritative, if
you like, official commentary that the
independent group of scientists have
made this determination that the rubber
duck video is genuinely anomalous?
Extremely valuable. And I think that
just gives them another piece in which
they, you know, the next video they get,
they'll have a But do you think, I mean,
it's often been misreported, I think, in
mainstream media. Do you think that
mainstream media have fairly and
accurately reported the significance of
what SCU found? No, not at all. Not at
all. And I don't even think I've seen
any reports from uh mainstream media
about the SCU, which is unusual, isn't
it? I mean, it is unusual. If an
authoritative group of scientists had
made a determination about any other
issue, you'd think it would be given
some degree of credibility in the media.
They have a they have a a top-notch
group of scientists working for them
over there. And I would think that would
be highly credible especially with what
they find. But it was significant for
you and Andy at least because you'd done
the right thing. Andy had made the
decision to put it before
SCU. It's anomalous. Yes. And I think in
having that independent exam of it was
extremely valuable. Why did they decide
it showed an object that was anomalous?
Because of the different characteristics
that it had. So there were no no heat
source on it. It moved in a weird and
strange way. Uh I don't know if you're
aware of that, but it was it was doing
some kind of weird circle pattern. So it
seemed to be searching for something. So
this is important on the video. It looks
like it's going in a straight line. It
does. It looks like it's going in a
straight line. Is it? No, it's not going
in a straight line. And they were able
to figure that out by looking at the GPS
location references on the video. That's
correct. that all that data was
provided. And what did that analysis by
SCU's Peter Rialei show? It showed that
the object was circling and the plane
was circling. So they were both going
around each other, which was quite quite
odd. And that the the actual operator of
the camera seemed to think that it was
uh making a search pattern. So this is
an object that is intelligently
controlled.
It appears that way. It's searching for
something. It appeared that way. What
was it searching for? Your guess is as
good as mine.
In your investigations, did you ever go
to the location where this object was
seen? I have worked out in that area,
but I did not go to the exact location
that it was seen. It would be an
interesting question, wouldn't it? What
What is it about the features of that
location? Perhaps the mineral
composition. It would it would
absolutely be worth checking out. Would
there be something underneath?
That's a distinct possibility, too.
There's lots of mines and caverns out
there. There would probably be something
called Quinn's Gate that might be worth
checking out out there as well. Well,
let's talk about Quinn's Gate. What's
Quinn's Gate? Ancient folklore about a
gate that may be uh a portal of some
sort. It's a rock structure. There's
plenty online that you can find out
about Quinn's Gate, but it's long been
rumored to be some sort of portal and
they've seen anomalous objects near it
as well, which fits the definition of
where all these pilots are seeing this
stuff. And this location, Quinn's Gate,
is very near where very near to where
the rubber duck was filmed. Interesting
coincidence, I'd say. So, so SCU make
this determination that this is an
anomalous object. Is there any response?
Have you become aware of any response at
all from either your former department
or any government agency? Not that I
know of. Like I said, Ross, I kind of
washed my hands from this after I gave
these videos to Andy and retired from
the Border Patrol. But crucially, maybe
it might be better coming from Andy.
This I understand that there was
eventually some kind of tacet
acknowledgement by a government agency
that this rubber duck video was indeed
anomalous. There was CBP actually did a
release. Okay, slow down. CBP is what
for our audience? The US Customs and
Border Pro protection did do a a release
kind of a uh a document dump per se.
They released some of the things that I
was working on as well as uh videos as
well. And what did that document dump
show? The document dump had a lot of the
work that I, like I said, that I was
working on, but it also had my personal
emails and and uh text messages as well
corresponding about uh what I was doing.
So, what was it in the documents that
were released by Customs and Border
Protection that underlined the fact that
this rubber duck video was anomalous?
Well, for one, it came from the
Department of Homeland Security. It
showed that it was an authentic video
that was coming from them and that was,
you know, part of the operations, per
se. But what what declaration, if any,
did they make about the the video? They
personally didn't make any
determinations about it. They just
released it. And I think their maybe
their uh response was let the public
decide. But basically there's no finding
by Customs and Border explaining what
that object was. It was a very vague uh
release of documents and videos. I don't
think uh the Department of Homeland
Security has uh commented on it.
You would appreciate that it's
fundamental to David Grush's allegations
that implicitly there are facilities
that are hiding nonhuman technology.
It's pretty disturbing.
The allegation is that this is being
hidden from the American public, which
is equally
disturbing. But by definition, if it's
true, there has to be facilities
somewhere in the United States where
these objects are being hidden. I I
would think that would be correct, of
some secret military base or some remote
location that they may be contained.
With the benefit of hindsight, do you
think it's plausible that the objects
that were reported to you by border
protection officials and indeed videoed
might be evidence of some kind of black
US program? Perhaps underground
facilities in Arizona. It It's possible
for sure it's possible. It's a vast
area. That training area, the military
training area out there where the agents
work is a vast area. So, it's
interesting because if it was
legal, I would have expected men in dark
suits to turn up to your boss's office
and say, "Can you please tell this Bob
guy to pull his head in?"
That's correct. They didn't, did they?
They didn't. But, you know, maybe
they've upgraded from the old stories to
something newer. But, do you think that
people would have become aware of your
investigations? It would have been
pretty widely known that you were doing
this research, wouldn't it? the the guys
in my office and shop knew I was doing
stuff with UAPs. So the Department of
Homeland Security knew that you were
doing investigations into UAPs. At least
at least a couple of my supervisors for
sure. So if there was an authorized,
congressionally approved, funded program
doing proper legal investigations into
lordable recovered investigations into
recovered non-human technology. You
would think that there would be a quiet
word given to your bosses and just ask
Bob to go quiet on that one. You would
think so. You would think so. And that
didn't happen. That did not happen.
Let's talk about
Sedona. There are a large number of
witnesses who've independently said to
us that they have seen very similar
objects to what your border protection
officials describe around Sedona. a
place tantalizingly described as Secret
Mountain. Have you ever heard of
interesting activity around Sedona? I
have heard of interesting activity
around Sedona and I've personally been
out to Sedona camping and spent time out
there exploring an area that's uh known
for having some of that activity. And
have you seen any of that yourself? I
did not. I I personally did not see any
activity while I was there doing an
doing some looking around, but uh a lot
of other people did. We have witnesses
who claim that they have been confronted
in the forest by men with guns
purporting to be government but not
showing any ID telling them that if they
don't leave they will be murdered.
I have not seen that personally. But do
you think it's plausible that the
military might be locating a facility
adjacent to a place like Sedona? I mean
is that even likely? Why would the
military locate themselves close to a
major tourist attraction? Well, it's a
tourist attraction for multiple reasons.
Not only its beauty, but it's also known
and rumored to contain vortexes and
energy healing centers. So, that might
be something a non-human intelligence or
a government program would be interested
in. But more importantly, it might also
provide cover, might not. It might also
provide cover. It would be so easy to
dismiss sightings as a bunch of loopy
tinfoil hat crazies looking at strange
objects in the sky and believing what
they want to believe. That would be
correct.
So you'd be familiar with the way
national security works in the United
States. There are levels of secrets.
That's correct. So when you were briefed
as a top secret cleared employee, you
knew that not above but parallel with
the top secret level of classification,
there are compartments of information.
That's right. And that's secure
compartmented information facilities and
that the rubber duck video actually made
its way into that uh initially. But when
you obtained it, it was no longer top
secret. it was no it was no longer uh
classified in that fashion. So there are
special access
programs, there are
um unacnowledged special access
programs, ASAPs from what I've heard.
And there are things called
Wooaps, waved unagnowledged special
access programs. And they are secrets
that are so important to US national
security that Congress only a few a few
people in Congress can be cleared to
know about them if at all. And that's
the gang of eight. Do you know about
this system? I I'm familiar a little bit
with the system, but uh as far as any
knowledge about how it operates or
works, that's not in my wheelhouse. But
the fascinating thing that I've
discovered in my research is
that it's not a
wooap. I've spoken to people who've
served on the gang of eight and they
tell me they were never cleared. If
there is such a secret program operating
in America, even the the toughest,
biggest, most important secrets of all,
the waved, unacknowledged special access
programs, the WOsPs, the gang of eight,
to their knowledge, has never been
briefed into such a program.
You're a patriot, aren't you? I am. I
like the idea that America might have
this technology. I like it as well. But
does it concern you as a loyal,
patriotic American citizen that Congress
may not have been properly informed?
I would think that would be an an
important step. There should be at least
a little bit of oversight involved with
it and and and uh used in a responsible
manner. Now, one of the funny things
about doing a story like this is you
have to get used to military acronyms.
We've talked about WooPs, waved
unacknowledged special access programs.
And there are also things cutely called
dums. Do you know what a dum is? That's
a deep underground military base from my
understanding. Do you know of deep
underground military bases yourself?
Just rumors. You've never seen one? I've
never seen one. You're not holding out
on us? I'm not holding out on you. But
clearly there are deep underground
military bases, some of which have even
become public. There's Raven Rock, which
is where the US government is meant to
be taken to in the event of nuclear war.
And I'm familiar with that. The
continuity of operations programs. I'm
personally I'm a master exercise
practitioner. So, designing exercises
and and exercising that component is is
an important piece. So, I'm aware of the
the the reason why they would uh utilize
facilities like that. And where would
you locate such a facility? What would
you look for locating a deep underground
military base? That's out of my
wheelhouse. I would I would refer that
to a geologist. There was probably
scientists that would have a better
answer to that question. But it's
plausible that you would use remote
areas. Remote location would be my first
choice. And one of the things Arizona is
good at is having remote
locations. And Sedona does report
there's an enormous number of people in
the Sedona area who are saying there are
weird things happening in our skies.
There weird things for sure in the skies
of Sedona. It's not just I've heard it
from people visiting there. Not just the
locals but people visiting as well.
There's even a cement works where locals
report seeing large articulated lorries
carrying very heavy concrete sections.
They disappear into a building and they
don't come out.
The suggestion is that it's owned by
Loheed Martin through a front company,
the Clark Dale Cement Works. I'm not
aware of that. They do have a facility
in Mesa that that I know uh about, but
Loheed Martin's name bobs up in the
Custard many times in this
investigation. Loheed Martin, Northrup,
Grumman, Rathon, Rathon, Patel. There's
many of the same old names, aren't
there? going right back to the 50s and
the 60s. That's correct. I grew up here
in Tucson and Rathon and Hughes Aircraft
was the it was Hughes Aircraft before it
was Rathon and Hughes was always an
important part of the Tucson community
and and let's be clear, these companies
have done fantastic things for the
defense of America. Absolutely. They're
ludable aerospace companies that have
done a great deal to protect our
country. Absolutely. And yet there's a
question mark. Well, they have
technology. They have certain programs
that I'm sure develop uh for future
weapons or future platforms or any other
items that are going to go towards
national security. One of the things I
know that you took a special interest in
during your work as a border protection
official are the Native American stories
and the um pictoglyphs. That's correct.
What do they show? What were the things
that you saw in the course of your
research that made you just question
whether this is a phenomenon that's been
around for a lot longer? Well, there's
anything from pictures of beans on these
rocks to to uh star charts or maps that
seem to coincide with, you know, stuff
in the sky, uh objects that may be seen
in the sky, triple dots, stuff like that
that seem to not make any rational sense
as to why they would be on there. But
they're usually found in some of those
areas that have these high uh incidents
of uh UAPs reported. Now Bob, I just
want to ask this investigation that you
did for border protection. This wasn't
just some idle freelance thing that you
did on your spare time. You were clearly
authorized by your bosses to do it. No,
I had definitely had a boss that wanted
me to put together a paper for him to
show to probably his superiors.
And to your knowledge though, has it
been acted upon? No, not that I to my
knowledge, I'm retired. I would not have
access to that information. Isn't that
unusual
to to not have it carried on or to have
access to that information? I mean, no
disrespect to you, but if I was a boss
in Border Protection and I've got
operatives, agents telling me that there
are hundreds of anomalous objects,
including a gigantic black triangle
that's 100 foot wide.
coming close to the border with Mexico.
I would regard that as a national
security issue. I would think so. But uh
I think the problem is what can you do
about it? Where they're they're working
on uh intelligence and and visualization
of these items that have a nexus to
smuggling. They're worried about
fentanyl coming in. They're worrying
about these drones delivering narcotics,
you know, in in the different areas that
they patrol. I think the the large black
triangles and orbs and other things are
just not in their wheelhouse.
There came a time there were other there
were other videos that you found,
weren't there? There was I got another
video from the u the original uh uh guy
that filmed the rubber duck video. Now,
that video is out there. We we didn't
release that like we did the other ones,
but that one is certainly available to
be viewed. What do you call that one?
That one I think is known as the cigar
video. So the same person that videoed
from a surveillance aircraft the rubber
duck video. Yes. Provided you with
another video. That's correct. It's just
not as of the same quality as the rubber
duck video. It was filmed with a cell
phone. And I think more more than
anything uh my uh companion showed it to
me to kind of get my uh opinion on it.
So I know the guy. uh he's a friend of
mine and I think he wanted to know
whether it was maybe even the same thing
as the rubber duck. It just couldn't be
determined because there wasn't enough
data and I thought the video was of, you
know, not the greatest quality. What
what conclusion did you reach about it?
Much like the other ones, I was open for
whatever it may be. I I have a a pretty
open mind. anything from uh anomalous uh
interdimensional interplanetary to even
the mundane uh object. Maybe I was, you
know, maybe we're seeing something
different mundane that it could possibly
be. But from my understanding and and my
experience operating those cameras, it's
nothing that I've ever seen before. Bob,
there are probably people watching this
who work in positions very similar to
yours in government agencies all over
the United States. In fact, I like to
think that this documentary might be
seen by people all over the world. What
would you say to people who know things,
who are aware of anomalous objects five
years on from your decision to go
public? Um, do you regret that decision?
Have you ever had cause to wish that you
hadn't done what you do?
No, I think uh I feel like after you
have access to this information and you
see some of these things, it's almost a
responsibility to help share it with
others and bring awareness about the
subject. What do you say to people who
just default ridicule and stigmatize and
treat with taboo this subject? Well, I
would say look up in the sky because you
probably see something and you're not
going to see it by uh looking down at
your phone all the time.
We've been manipulated, haven't we? I do
believe so. We've been told these
objects don't exist. Or are swamp gas or
Venus or any of the old terms. I think
bird and drone are just the new swamp
gas and Venus. So, you don't accept that
these are all drones.
The way and the way they moved and the
characteristics of some of these things
defies what is known as a drone for the
most part here. I mean, do drones
operate at 36,000 ft at 575 miles an
hour? None that I know of. And I've
operated a few drones.
These are genuine unexplained phenomena.
They are. And
yet, nobody seems to care. Well, it gets
back to the adage what I was saying
before. Unless it has a nexus to
smuggling, I don't think it's in the the
Border Patrol's wheelhouse. That's all
right. I don't buy
that. I don't buy that. Do you think
there's something more here? Is somebody
shutting down this debate inside
government? I I can't say that for sure,
but uh like I said, I just don't think
it's in the the Border Patrol has other
things to worry about right now, and
they're just not it would appear they're
just not worried about UAPs or the
Department of Homeland Security. I can't
I can't, like I said, I I am retired now
and I can't speak for the Department of
Homeland Security, but while I was
working there, it just wasn't something
that was reported. And I don't think it
was something that they worried about.
The cartels smuggling people and drugs
over the border. They're dangerous
people. That's what they were worried
about. That's what the border patrol is
worried about. They got money and
weapons of and weapons of mass
destruction. What we're looking at is
billions of dollars in this black
industry. They do. Is it plausible that
they've developed technology that we
don't yet know about that might explain
all of these objects? Well, with having
an unlimited budget, you would probably,
you know, be able to field technology
that, you know, less fortunate people
would have. Is it your suspicion,
though, that there's something non-human
behind what we're seeing? That's my
impression.
You really do believe that? I really do
believe that. So, you think what we're
seeing may be in fact non-human
technology? I think
it you could remove technology. I I I
can't say for certain it's technology
that's occurring. It may be something
that we're completely unaware of. The
thing I find fascinating is a lot of the
witnesses around Sedona describe these
objects, triangles,
orbs, craft of some kind. And next to
them, apparently escorting them are
Apache helicopters, Blackhawk
helicopters. What's going on?
I personally can't comment on that
because I haven't seen anything like
that. I have seen when I was in the
military uh a B1 bomber being escorted
by chase planes in in the northern in at
the National Training Center in Fortn
California. So that seems to fit a
pattern of how they would escort
something like that around. And the and
the and the the B2 bomber looks like a
UFO anyway. So, from a side profile,
having two chase planes alongside that
thing would give that impression. So, I
haven't seen anything Sedona and I
haven't heard of uh or know anyone
that's seen exactly what you described.
Well, 5 years ago, you made a
decision to do a big thing for you as a
covert operator inside Border
Protection. You made the decision to go
public with information that you think
the public has a right to know. I I I do
have a a strong opinion that I think the
public needs to know about what's flying
around over the deserts of southwest
Arizona. That's for sure. This is a
flight safety and a national security
concern. I think you can combine those
two together for sure and that that
gives a better case as to why this
should be, you know, out in the public.
Are you confident that there has been
any kind of adequate investigation into
the issues you raised? I just don't have
access to that information. I'd like to
think that the legacy of my work would
continue on and have some sort of
meaning meaningful impact and allow the
guys to be able to report stuff like
that, but honestly, Ross, I'm so far
removed from the Border Patrol right
now, I wouldn't have access to that
information. But when for example the
Pentagon's UAP investigation office, the
all domain anomaly resolution office
makes a finding as it did in 2024 that
there is no evidence of extraterrestrial
visitation to this planet. There is no
evidence of any US secret program. Do
you think they've really tried to look?
I don't think so. And I and I find it
actually very disrespectful to the
scientists that put in the time at SCU
to look at the rubber duck video and
stuff that could have been included in
that report which was deemed anonymous
by or anomalous by you know senior
scientists that have a lot of years of
experience. So so crucially you haven't
seen any proper official investigation
at least in the public domain to deal
with the issues that were quite ludably
addressed by SCU in its objective
assessment of that video. I have not
seen that. Would you like to see it?
Absolutely. Absolutely.
Bob, when I first saw those videos,
particularly the rubber duck video, I
have to admit I giggled. It just seemed
so absurd. I thought it was rubbish. It
It's a funny name for a video. Uh the
object is funny looking in the
video. It's unexplained.
So, let's talk about the petetroglyphs.
I'm fascinated in your work as a border
protection officer. You actually got to
learn a lot about the Native American
culture in the same area, didn't you? I
did. Uh and and where I worked uh mainly
was the Tona Odum Indian Reservation,
which is out kind of by Cells, Arizona.
south of there there are uh sacred sites
that the toon OD people have and I got
to go around and explore some of those
when I wasn't you know fully engaged in
arresting uh people and the thing I find
fascinating is there are ancient
petetroglyphs on the wall aren't there
there are what do they show a lot of
them show different beings that uh could
be described as maybe extraterrestrial
different shapes of people there's even
uh uh petetroglyphs that have three dots
three orbs looking type things on them.
And you saw those many times. I've seen
those. Yes. I've seen them all over the
state, as a matter of fact. And what did
the Native American Indians tell you?
They were
stuff that comes from the sky. So, they
talk about this. Absolutely. Absolutely.
And it's and it's not just uh it's not
just uh uh other people talk about that
as well within the Native American. And
it's starting to make more uh mainstream
uh kind
of public information news for the most
part.
Bob, this all begs the question, all the
evidence you've
seen, the
data on your assessment, are we
alone? I'm open for all kinds of
possibilities. Everything from maybe a
spiritual or divine uh encounter all the
way to nuts and bolts or even a more
mundane. But for me, the mundane side of
it, I always try to look at things and
and try to explain it away first with
the more mundane items. Uh, that's just
the way I have always been my entire
life. And I have thousands of hours on
those cameras looking at, you know,
different objects, everything from
coyotes to rabbits to the moon even. And
there are things in those videos that I
can't explain. And what they are,
uh, they could be beings for all we
know. They could be the rubber duck
shows something that even was discussed
as being someone flying through the sky
in the lotus position. So, I'm open to
all those
possibilities. But if what you're
talking about is true, this is the
biggest secret in human history, isn't
it? It is. But has it not been going on
and been reported all throughout history
as well? We just have better technology
to capture it right now instead of a
painting or
a the side of a boulder. The cigar, are
you willing to share that cigar video
with us? Absolutely. I will uh let you
guys watch that cigar video and and show
it to you. uh getting that video. It was
not released with the other ones just
because we didn't think it showed as
profound of of objects, but it still was
was valuable uh showing that the that
the agents do see stuff on a on a
continual basis. Okay, Bob. So, the
video is the one that nobody's seen
before. What do you call it? It's been
named the uh cigar video. Why is it
called the cigar? It's got the the the
object that's being observed in the the
camera is got the shape of a cigar. It's
a kind of a short stubby cigar shape.
And when was it taken? What was the
circumstances in which it was taken? Uh
it was taken fairly close to around the
time that the rubber duck was. Maybe
within a few months or so. Uh the agent
that filmed the rubber duck sent it to
me. He wanted me to look at it and see
what I thought of it. So the same man
who recorded the rubber duck video,
that's correct. was involved in the
recording of this new video that
nobody's seen before. That's correct.
Okay. So, let's have a look at it. All
right.
Okay.
So, that's the object you're talking
about. It's like a stubby little
cylinder. That's correct. I can see why
they call it a cigar. It's very blurry.
It is blurry. And I felt that it just
didn't provide enough data. I showed I
showed Andy it, but it just we didn't
feel like it it warranted uh it does
seem to be moving incredibly fast. It
does seem to be moving fast, and that
could be due to the parallax effect as
well, but do you agree that it there's
some kind of trail behind it? There does
appear to be a trail behind it, but I
don't I can't tell. It's such a low
quality video that it could very well be
artifact, camera artifact. Oh, right.
Okay. So it could be pixelization. It's
not something that was actually there.
It's just a pixelation. No, but but at
the same time that could be something
that was attached to it as well. You
know, maybe it was a you know something
on a That is odd right there. Sure is.
Is there anything we can determine from
any of the data? Like can you read in
the original video any of the data? No,
unfortunately you can't. It's it's just
not a clear enough video.
And like I said, I don't think they when
when they saw it, they wanted my opinion
for sure, but I I just didn't think it
it it held the value like the other ones
did. So, is it is it hot or cold, that
object? Well, looking at the terrain
right now, I can't I can't see the
settings for the the camera because
they're blurred out, but to me, it looks
like that is probably black hot because
the trees are are white hot. So, that
would be hot in my opinion, maybe. I
mean, it almost looks like a missile.
Could it be the Air Force testing a
missile? That's a distinct possibility
where it was filmed at. Maybe it's some
sort of, you know, cruise missile or
smart missile that's flying and, you
know, being tracked, but it doesn't
appear to have, you know, a vapor trail
or anything else that would uh cuz you'd
expect a glowing propulsion. You would
think it would be
so questionable. Just you can't say one
way or the other. Can't say what it is.
I just at that point in time there did
look like there was kind of a contrail
but I just don't think there's enough
data to ascertain what it is. I mean
even even there at that point it looks
like it may could even be a combination
of black hot and white hot. Uh there the
thing I find fascinating is that in the
foid US Air Force reports there are
pilots that report coming across
cylindrical objects at hugely high
altitudes. Well, that might fit the
bill. Could it be the Tic Tac? The
legendary Tic Tac? Uh, that would be
incredibly tough to say because I think
that thing's only been seen near uh
bodies by the ocean and stuff. Is that
correct? I don't know to be perfectly
honest. I mean, I think people have seen
cylindrical UFOs for many decades.
It very well could be. I like I said, I
just don't think there's enough data to
make any determination with this. I
would certainly love to see a clear uh a
clearer version of this video to maybe
uh make that determination, but I myself
couldn't make a determination of what it
was. The frustrating lesson from this
particular video is what ODNI, the
Office of the Director of National
Intelligence, mandated in 2021 was the
collection of all of this data on
unidentified anomalous objects. Go. It's
so important because you're the border
protection guys at the time. You don't
know what this was. No. No, not at all.
And that's a concern.
I think so. And yet everywhere in our
administration of government, I see a
deafening silence about videos like this
and the four other videos you've shown
us.
It It's It's concerning. It it's
certainly concerning knowing that
whatever it is is flying around out in
areas where I used to work for sure and
there are people actively working. By
definition, these have to be
investigated, don't they? I would think
it would be imperative to see what their
you know what what the intent of these
things are. Would this incident have
been kept and recorded on file somewhere
inside Border Protection? maybe with the
the platform that it was recorded from,
not with uh border protection itself
because as you can hear in the video,
you can hear the engines running of the
the RC26 aircraft, which is an air uh
national guard asset.
It's frustrating, isn't it? It must been
very frustrating for you to have
hundreds of reports from Border Patrol
agents clearly suggesting this is
something that was of sufficient concern
for them to report it to you. I think
so. Uh during the during the course of
my duties, you know, it didn't go out as
a solicitation that, you know, I was on
a detail that was trying to gather this
data up. Uh maybe if it would have and
not had a stigma associated with it or
taboo associated with it, maybe I would
have gotten more videos from agents, but
like I said, I've gotten, you know,
eyewitness reports, statements from
agents that have told me that they've
seen other things, including, you know,
openings of portals even on on some of
these cameras. So I I take all that
bigger pattern. So agents have told you
they've seen portals portals opening in
the sky. Stuff stuff in the sky filmed
by Fleer camera. Just some of the
stories I've heard, Russ. Whoa, hold up.
That's interesting. Yep. So, what did
you get told? I got told that they
witnessed a portal opening up in the sky
and there were pictures of it on a
camera that I was able to see. It wasn't
video, but there were pictures. Now, how
do they know it was a portal rather than
just a glowing orb or something like
that? They said they saw something
specifically open up and looked at it
with the the the camera and took
pictures of it with the camera and I saw
those pictures. It didn't it didn't
reveal to me anything that I could, you
know, name. It looked like a blob and a
another circle around another blob.
Would that video still exist? I'm not
sure. I'm not sure. It might. If it
does, it's down in Cenoida on uh a
handheld thermal camera. So Bob, the
next video we want you to look at is I
think the most interesting one. It's the
rubber duck video. Now this is
importantly, this is the one that was
sent by Andy to the scientific coalition
for UAP uh studies for analysis and they
concluded
definitively this object is anomalous.
Let's have a look at
it. That is the weirdest thing. It does
have an odd shape.
Could it be a balloon? Maybe something
dangling below the balloon? No, I think
you would you would probably see that in
the uh the video here. There's clearly
enough room that, you know, if there was
something dangling, it'd probably be a
good 100 foot long, you know, cord if it
was, you know, something above it. But
to to be honest, this shows, especially
in the areas that are dark, that these
may even be two separate objects. The
weird thing about it is it really does
look like a rubber duck. Does look like
a rubber duck and that's where the name
came from. Could it be two objects?
Well, there's been speculation that it
could be two objects and you can see a
space clearly between the objects when
you go over a dark spot of the of the of
the video. And the other thing about it
is is it's it it's a lot colder than uh
the surrounding areas as well. So what
does the fact what does the color of the
object in this fluur imagery mean? It
shows that that object is extremely
cold. So it's not showing heat. It's not
showing heat and we know that because
the the plane flies over several uh uh
cows during the course of the video and
those cows will show up as
blackot. Just set the scene for me.
Whereabouts is this taken? Okay, so this
video is taken down uh just off to the
east of of Sassi uh Arizona on a on an
area known as the Buenos ARS uh National
Wildlife Area. And the air above it is
part of a military training. The area
above it is part of what is known as the
MOA uh Ruby Fuzzy MOA and it's a remote
isolated part of the Arizona desert. It
is a remote isolated part of the desert.
There are there is a uh a port of entry
off to the west that uh you can cross
into Mexico. But these guys are out
there. Uh they were track and got called
for a group of uh illegal aliens that
had come through and were out there
looking for them when this thing popped
through the viewfinder. It just happened
to go right where they were looking for
the for the bodies. So, there was some
speculation at first that this may have
been, you know, some kind of cartel
distraction to get the the the pilots
and and air support off of where the
group may have been, but that didn't
seem to be the case as this uh continued
on. Okay, devil's advocate for a moment.
I mean, it could be perhaps two balloons
tied together. Maybe it is that maybe
the cartel sent two interesting looking
balloons across the border to distract
you. it appears just to be drifting
erratically in a straight line. Um,
unfortunately, SCU's analysis did not
show that, Ross. What this the SCU's
analysis showed was that that that
object was going in a circular pattern
as the as the uh RC26 Metroliner was was
also circling over the top of it. They
were making two circles at once. Oh, so
it's not going in a straight line at
all. It's not going in a straight line
at all. So the the the aircraft's
tracking it as it's moving in a circle.
There was and that's what the SCU report
shows as well. So what's in the middle
of that circle? Uh that's yet to be
determined, but it would be interesting
to find out see what it was looking for.
And that's the way it was described,
Ross. This was described as uh an object
uh in some sort of search pattern. So
the implications of that are that on the
SCU on the scientific coalition for UAP
studies analysis this object's clearly
intelligently controlled.
Uh it does have that appearance
because it's Is it fair to say it was
moving in a controlled way? That's what
the pilots and the uh the agent that uh
gave it to me suggested that it was in a
search pattern. They think they thought
it was searching for something. They
thought it was searching for something
and that was even written in the u uh
the intelligence report that accompanied
it. Were you able to speak to the pilots
from the surveillance aircraft that
recorded this? I was. And I actually
spoke to the sensor operator. The pilots
weren't able to see this. They have a
small screen in the front of the cockpit
that allows them to see what the what
the uh mission sensor uh operator is is
filming, but it's it's difficult for
them because it's not on a large screen.
The mission sensor operator described it
just as we have said. They seem to think
it was searching from something, but
they didn't know 100%. Their only uh
thing that they could pair it to was
maybe a drone or a balloon. So, SCU, the
Scientific Coalition for UAP Studies,
has ruled out the possibility that it
was a balloon or a drone. Yeah, it'd be
interesting to talk to the pilots and
the sensor operator now because I don't
think they know that information and
maybe this will help them uh you know in
the future.
Could it be some kind of technology that
that the US is testing in this remote
part of the desert and unwittingly got
caught by your surveillance cameras?
That's a distinct possibility,
especially with the uh you know kind of
the climate of of the Air Force bases
and the private military contractors
that are around the area. They certainly
could be testing out
something. I can't say for sure what it
is. I have to say it's a ridiculous
looking object. It is a ridiculous
looking object.
I think the I think for the public
domain though, the crucial point to make
is whilst it looks like it's moving in a
straight line, you've got an aircraft
that's circling as it's circling. One of
the one of the stranger things that I've
heard, uh, there was an individual that,
uh, said it it looked like a a man
seated in lotus position flying across
the desert. That was one of the odder
explanations that I had heard. It's
certainly pretty weird, but definitely
anomalous. Well, it's similar to some of
the other ones, too. At at times this
object does appear to to uh kind of look
like uh one of the other ones that we
have which is lab bruha. Bob, one of the
problems I have with a lot of videos I
get sent by people is they're blurry.
They don't show much.
But the cool thing about this video was
that for the first time from the border
protection videos, you were able to take
it to a bunch of scientists who could
analyze the data, the headings, the GPS
points. That's correct. I think the data
sets are probably one of the more
important parts of that video. So that's
corroborative evidence. Corroative
evidence. You've also got the eyewitness
evidence. Eyewitness, the sensor
operator, the sensor operator and the
agent and the what? Sorry, and the agent
as well as the border patrol. Oh, so
there was a border patrol agent sitting
in the aircraft sitting next to the
sensor operator. So two sets of human
eyes looking at that object. Human eyes
looking at that human object. They think
it's weird. They think it's weird.
The video when you analyze it and look
at the implications of these data sets,
the GPS locations, the speed, is it
moving particularly fast? No, it's not
moving overly fast, but it it was
certainly moving fast enough for them to
uh, you know, warrant looking at it
because I think originally they may have
thought it was something carrying a
carrying an object and and and the
person that filmed this, that was one of
their concerns as well. But when they
observed it long enough, they determined
that it didn't appear to be carrying any
object. Because you've got to use your
brain to watch this video, don't you? If
you're a viewer sitting back home, what
do you have to understand? It's not
moving in a straight line. It's not
moving in a straight line, but it
doesn't have the uh the kind of the
defined what they are known as the five
observables. So, this this is is
different in that aspect, but it is
showing one of the five observables.
It's not showing any visible propulsion
system. Not not any visible propulsion
system.
So the the fascinating thing about this
is the two sets of human eyes, the
border patrol agent, the sensor
operator, they've reached the conclusion
based on their analysis, expert
witnesses. This can't be explained well
and they felt it important enough to
follow it as well for the time frame
that they did. So, in many ways, what
people have got to do back home is fight
the instinctive prejudice to go, look,
it just looks like a balloon floating
across a landscape. Well, I've not seen
any balloons like that. And if it is a
rubber duck, you know, maybe a party
balloon is flying backwards, not the
normal way a party balloon would fly.
But
crucially, this object is definitive
proof of being intelligently controlled.
I don't know if you could go as far as
that, but it's certainly doing things
that uh make it seem like it is under
intelligent control. How significant a
video do you think this is? I think it
just adds to the the the piece of the
puzzle and if it can provide that uh
evidence for finding out what's going on
in the grander picture, I think it's an
important video. But in your book, in
your investigation, you were looking for
unidentified anomalous phenomena and no
doubt about it. The kicker with this
one, this is definitely anomalous. Well,
it's been deemed that through SEU for
sure. So, I I I am not a a level of
scientist in any form or fashion like
those guys are, and I hold their opinion
in high regard. But it was 2019 when
this video was shot. That's correct. So,
we're talking five or six years since
this video was shot. You've never got an
answer for what this was, have you? Not
Not unless uh SCU is the answer.
It's anomalous. It's anomalous. And it
concerned two operatives inside Border
Protection sufficiently that they gave
it to you. Yeah, they uh they gave it to
me to show it to me. I don't think they
knew what I was going to do with it, but
once that once once it was looked at
enough times by other border patrol
agents, I was confident enough in in
knowing that it it probably wasn't any
of the things that we see on a normal
basis, which are balloons and birds and
stuff. So, you can see the miles per
hour. It's it's kind of jumping. Yeah.
Um but at the peak, it's getting up to
200 miles an hour. Yeah. I'm not
entirely certain that's the speed of it.
Uh you'd have to refer to the report to
see what that uh showed. What you see on
this freeze of the video, there's a
distinct dot down in the bottom right
hand corner. So let's watch what happens
to that
dot. So the dot's clearly moving around
the aircraft. It seemed at first the A10
passed that object and then that object
for whatever reason decided to catch up
to the to the uh A10, it appears. Could
that be a balloon? There's no balloons
that I know that can travel the speed of
an A-10. How fast is the A10 moving? I'm
not an expert on A10, but I would assume
it's upwards in the couple hundred mile
hour range. And could it be a drone?
Uh if a drone can travel a couple
hundred miles per hour, that's something
that uh someone should probably be
interested in. Okay. So, what we're
seeing here is it looks like a sphere of
some kind. I I don't see any propulsion
system on it. Do you? No, I do not. And
yet, it's moving at presumably several
hundred miles an hour to keep pace with
the A-10. Well, and then in addition to
that, it appears the A-10 notices it and
kind of turns off. Did you have any
opportunity to speak to the pilot? No, I
did not. So, this is a US Air Force
plane. I've I've only uh spoken to the
guy that uh was able to get me this
video. That doesn't look like a drone,
does it? It does not look like a drone.
I mean, with the level of detail you can
see of the aircraft here, you'd expect
to see propellers. That's correct. And I
think if it was a bird as well, you'd
probably see more profound flapping if
it was a any bird of uh good size. What
have the debunkers said about the video?
Everything from birds to drag drones to
balloons. It's the normal uh kind of
banter. But crucially in the documents
that were dumped by the Customs Border
Protection, was there any attempt to
explain it away? No. And there wasn't
there wasn't a lot of uh uh the the
interest was generated uh internally
with the guys that were familiar with
the truck and had seen it before. and
and and like I said, uh once I had put
my feelers out for obtaining some of
these videos, videos that showed stuff
that was anomalous, this one came up and
I had actually heard about this one for
a while. So, uh once I had the
opportunity to get it, I was able to,
you know, put it into the share drive
where the that that document dump
ultimately ended up. What is it? I I I
couldn't honestly tell you, Ross. I
mean, you agree. It looks like a some
kind of solid maybe perhaps spherical
object. It It does. I I think it morphs
a little bit, too. At one point in this
video, it seemed to be like it was
tumbling. So, I don't know. If you if
you compare it to the size of the A10,
it could be uh you know, a fairly good
size. Maybe that's you know, three feet
uh wide, three, four feet wide. I don't
know what's the length of an A-10 or the
wingspan of an A-10.
Were you able to find any explanation
for what that object might be? No. And
and from my searching looking for any
type of incident report that was
generated with it, uh came up with
nothing. So I just don't think it was
reported. But the interesting thing is
you know about this because this was
detected by Border Protection. Do do we
know if the US Air Force even knows that
one of its A-10 aircraft was being
tracked by an object? Well, there is
some uh there there is the story of the
the Air Force coming down and and uh
commandering that uh file. Oh, they took
the file. We just happened to get it
before the Air Force took it. Tell me
more. So, the Air Force came in and I
don't know any more than that, Ross. I
do know that the Air Force came down
with a laptop, plugged it into the truck
and took that file and left.
No further explanation. No further
explanation. Much like the the other one
we talked about, which does suggest that
they became aware of it from someone in
Border Protection, some someone from
Border Protection or maybe it was the
pilot that reported and it just took him
a while to track down where the where
the video was at.
The fascinating thing is in the report
to
Congress, the Pentagon's UAP
investigation office claims there's
absolutely no evidence of anything that
might be non-human. Well, it'd be nice
if they saw this video and and I think
it adds to uh speculation as to what
this could be and I think it shows a
pretty interesting piece of evidence.
Again, you think this is anomalous? I do
think it's anomalous. So the A10 here is
clearly being pursued or followed by
some kind of object.
Okay. So that object chasing the A10
there. So the fourth video is lab bruha
the witch means witch in Spanish. So set
this one up for me. So this was filmed
on the Tona Odum Indian reservation and
it's it's by a a little village by the
name of Topawa. The truck sits up on a
hill that kind of overlooks the area
that's known for uh smuggling operations
by the cartel. This this object was uh
something that came into the the frame
that the operator clearly saw. I don't
have a backstory behind this other than
it was just sitting there labeled uh uh
Topawa UFO video. Okay.
And here it is. It actually looks like a
humanoid form. It moves very bizarrely.
Looks like a spaceman. That was one of
my first impressions was that it was
someone maybe with a jetpack cruising
across the desert. Okay. Could it be a
jetpack? I would think it would show
something different on the uh camera.
You'd probably see a more profound heat
signature from a jetpack. So, is that a
heat signature? No, because
unfortunately, if you look, those cows
uh are reflecting back that black hot.
So, that means that they are uh the
heat's showing black. The object up at
the top is white, which means it's ice
cold. Okay. So, let's see what
happens. The cows don't react. They
don't react, you know, and it's it's
difficult to see the perspective there.
Those two cows look like they're closer
to where uh that object is. And at that
point in time, if you looked, you saw it
almost looks like something was coming
out of the bottom of the of the object.
But if it was a jetpack, you would think
it would make quite a ruckus. And any
car would be startled by that. You would
think so. That's moving seemingly
silently across the landscape. That's
correct. And it's quite a large object.
It's almost as large as those cows.
Well, and you can see uh with reference
to the sarro cactus, the sarro cactuses
are those black uh line objects there,
too. So, it's almost half of the size of
one of those in some shots. It seems to
be moving around in its horizontal plane
as well. There's a couple of areas where
it looks like it makes a turn and maybe
even some dust get gets kicked up at one
point in time. Could it be the cartel
pumping up a balloon and putting a
balloon over the border? Well, if it is,
it's uh it certainly distracted your
border patrol operatives, hasn't it? Uh,
I would say so. If if that was a balloon
or a cartel uh delivery device, it's uh
certainly superior to anything that we
have.
Because is it is there any evidence that
it's moving intelligently? It just seems
to be drifting. Well, there there's
there's a place in the video where it
looks like it maybe makes a turn. But
yeah, I would say that you you couldn't
really make the the argument that it is
uh under intelligent control, but it but
it is moving in in a way that is that
the point where it looks like it made a
turn. Yeah. Did Did you see that? Yeah.
It looked like it leaned over a bit,
maybe. I'm stumped on it. I I uh I have
no idea what it is. Why did they call it
Lab Bruha?
Well, that was Andy's uh that was Andy's
uh uh choice. And it resembles a lot of
things that were seen down in Mexico and
Central America. See, that's where it
turns.
Exactly. To me, uh that's certainly
anomalous. So, when you were doing your
analysis, were you looking at the
prevailing weather conditions? I mean,
could there have been a wind that maybe
blew that as a balloon off course?
Certainly. And if it's able to dodge uh
some of the cactuses and other things,
it's quite a remarkable balloon. So, you
actually see that you see it moving away
from cactuses. It appears that way in a
couple of the segments there because
that's the other issue, too, is it's
not, you know, you can delineate a
distance because it's moving in front of
cactuses at different times. You can see
that. You can definitely see that and
doing that you can calculate a speed.
You could I didn't take the time to
calculate the speed. That's uh far past
my ability.
But in your view anomalous I I would say
so what it could be I couldn't I
couldn't even begin to speculate.
There's nothing from a mundane
standpoint like I said with the hours
that I have observing cows and
everything else
that even makes sense that
does what this thing does. What's the
story behind this video? So, this video
was was uh given me given to me by the
same guy that filmed the rubber duck
video. He wanted me to take a peek at it
and see what I thought of it. So, when I
got it, uh one of the first things I
noticed was it wasn't the greatest
quality. Is the US government hiding
something?
I I think that's a question that the
American public probably should be
asking. And do you think it's a
legitimate question?
Well, it's a it's a legitimate question
that I think is trying to be
delegitimized in in public or at least
by maybe certain parts of the
government. Knowing what you know, have
we all in the public arena been
hoodwinkedked? Do you think there's a
game going on? Somebody's pulling
strings to keep this from us? Well, they
can tell you that you're not seeing
something so many times, but if people
are seeing these things, at some point
in time, there's going to be a tipping
point, it would appear. You think
there's something there, don't you? I do
think there's something
there. What it is, I don't know. Uh, but
I think it uh is non-human. Good on you,
buddy. Thank you. Cheers.
